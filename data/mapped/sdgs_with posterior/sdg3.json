Research questions about this discrepancy have not been fully answered. This study applies artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to explore the complex network of factors and the cause-effect relationships affecting the place of death, with the ultimate aim of developing policies favouring home-based end-of-life care.Methods: A data mining algorithm and a causal probabilistic model for data analysis were developed with information derived from expert knowledge that was merged with data from  deceased cancer patients in southern Switzerland. This data set was obtained via a retrospective clinical chart review.Results: Dependencies of disease and treatment-related decisions demonstrate an influence on the place of death of %. Anticancer treatment in advanced disease prevents or delays communication about the end of life between oncologists, patients and families. Unknown preferences for the place of death represent a great barrier to a home death. A further barrier is the limited availability of family caregivers for terminal home care. The family’s preference for the last place of care has a high impact on the place of death of %, while the influence of the patient’s preference is low, at %. Approximately one-third of family systems can be empowered by health care professionals to provide home care through open end-of-life communication and good symptom management. Such intervention has an influence on the place of death of %. If families express a convincing preference for home care, the involvement of a specialist palliative home care service can increase the probability of home deaths by %.Conclusion:Concerning death at home, open communication about death and dying is essential. Furthermore, for the patient preference for home care to be respected, the family’s decision for the last place of care seems to be key. The early initiation of family-centred palliative care and the provision of specialist palliative home care for patients who wish to die at home are suggested.","doc_id":63,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"84","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2306","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Large-scale, insect-cell-based vaccine development","authors":"Bogli, Nicole C.; Ries, Christoph; Adams, Thorsten; Greller, Gerhard; Eibl, Dieter; Eibl-Schindler, Regine","subject":" Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Large-scale, insect-cell-based vaccine development;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","doc_id":77,"prior":"vaccine","SDG3":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2895","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Development of a non-hydroxamate dual matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7/-13 inhibitor","authors":"Fischer, Thomas; Riedl, Rainer","subject":"Medicinal chemistry; Drug discovery; Inhibitor;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Development of a non-hydroxamate dual matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-/- inhibitor; Medicinal chemistry; Drug discovery; Inhibitor;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; Matrix metalloproteinase  (MMP-) is a member of the MMP superfamily and is able to degrade extracellular matrix proteins such as casein, gelatin, fibronectin and proteoglycan.

Translation Studies has seen a recent interest in connections between ecology and T&I, including how eco-systemic and eco-holistic concepts inform the emerging paradigm of “eco-translatology” (Hu, ) and Cronin’s () approach to “eco-translation”, based on the political ecology of social, economic and economic factors affecting human and environmental interactions. These developments parallel those in other disciplines that can deepen our understanding of situated T&I (e.g. Cadwell & O’Brien, ), first and foremost communicative ecology (Foth & Hearn, ). The communicative ecology model can help improve our inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge of the interactive dynamics between T&I and the predominantly organizational settings in which they take place. Organization Studies provides a powerful framework in the form of the Communicative Constitution of Organizations (CCO) (Schoeneborn et al., ), where recent research indicates that translators’ agency can be a valuable organizational asset (Piekkari et al., ), but one whose impact is restricted by self-concept issues and overly linear, top-down processes that prevent translators’ and other agents’ interactive involvement in both conveying and shaping organizational identities and strategic messages (Christensen & Cornelissen, ; Massey & Wieder, ). The time is therefore ripe to recalibrate research to address the ecological dimensions of organizational T&I, by applying methods of translatorial linguistic ethnography (e.g. Koskinen, ) and ethnographic action research (e.g. Tacchi et al., ) to investigate the rich layers of communicative ecologies where translators and interpreters work, and to act on the results. Only then can their agency be fully understood and training needs be properly met.","doc_id":157,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24727","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"What is the relapse risk during treatment? : survivor analysis of single and multiple relapse events in inpatients with alcohol use disorder as part of an observational study","authors":"Senn, Smeralda; Volken, Thomas; Rösner, Susanne; Wieber, Frank","subject":"Alcohol use disorder; Relapse; Survival analysis; Treatment;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"What is the relapse risk during treatment? : survivor analysis of single and multiple relapse events in inpatients with alcohol use disorder as part of an observational study; Alcohol use disorder; Relapse; Survival analysis; Treatment;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Introduction: During treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD), about % of patients return to drinking. Whether the risk of relapse changes during treatment and how relapses may affect the risk of subsequent relapse are unclear, however. The current study, therefore, aims to identify when and with what probability relapses occur.Methods: One hundred and three inpatients at an AUD treatment center participated in this observational study. The study documented relapse to drinking using breath analyzers, urine tests, and self-reported incidents for  days after the start of treatment. Time to the first relapse event and to any subsequent relapse event served as the outcome measures. The study determined the proportion of patients who had not experienced a relapse event at any given point by Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. The study team computed the instantaneous probability of experiencing an event at any given point using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models of the binomial family with log-link and exchangeable correlation structure to estimate unadjusted and adjusted hazards.Results: Whereas the hazards of experiencing a first relapse event declined steadily over the  days, the hazards of experiencing a subsequent relapse following an initial event remained stable. Both first-time and recurrent relapses were positively associated with the number of DSM- AUD criteria.Conclusion: Whereas the risk of relapse declines with each day of abstinence during treatment, it remains high after an individual relapse for the first time. This finding implies that therapy should focus on strengthening selfefficacy for low-risk groups and on relapse-prevention strategies for high-risk groups.","doc_id":231,"prior":"alcohol use","SDG3":1},{"id":"50","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24205","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"A longitudinal study on generalized anxiety among university students during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland","authors":"Amendola, Simone; von Wyl, Agnes; Volken, Thomas; Zysset, Annina; Huber, Marion; Dratva, Julia","subject":"Anxiety; Longitudinal; Lockdown; Coronavirus; COVID-19 pandemic; Linear mixed model;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen)","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"158, 305","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"A longitudinal study on generalized anxiety among university students during the first wave of the COVID- pandemic in Switzerland; Anxiety; Longitudinal; Lockdown; Coronavirus; COVID- pandemic; Linear mixed model;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen); Objective: The COVID- pandemic and government measures implemented to counter the spread of the infection may be a major stressor affecting the psychological health of university students.

For many, it added additional stress to an already stressful lifestyle that is prevalent in our society. Because stress can be detrimental to both physical and mental health, many people are seeking help and support from health practitioners. Due to pandemic restrictions, entire populations were prevented from seeking professional help and were left to deal with the situation on their own. Therefore, alternative ways to release stress and prevent stress-related symptoms are needed for times when professional help is scarce or unavailable. The aim of this study was to identify effective web- and app-based interventions to reduce mental and physical symptoms of stress and to explore their use in situations where traditional health care is not at hand.Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL Complete Articles published between  and , focusing on otherwise healthy adults, and demonstrating efficacy in reducing stress or/and stress-related symptoms were included. Results: A total of  articles were found with  effective products ( web-based,  apps). Most products are course-like sessions on different topics and exercises using methods such as psychoeducation, education on stress, cognitive restructuring, emotional regulation, problem solving, goal setting, breathing, mindfulness techniques, meditation, and relaxation. Also, most products use more than one technique and mixed materials such as text messages, videos, text, and audio information. The products often use methods to keep the user engaged, such as integration into daily routines, future planning, or reminders.Discussion: There are several products that have been shown to be effective in reducing perceived stress and stress-related symptoms. These are readily available and have a very low threshold. Therefore, they are suitable for providing care to communities during times when traditional health care supply is not readily available or is overwhelmed.","doc_id":289,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18631","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Appetite-suppressing and satiety-increasing bioactive phytochemicals : a systematic review","authors":"Stuby, Johann; Gravestock, Isaac; Wolfram, Evelyn; Pichierri, Giuseppe; Steurer, Johann; Burgstaller, Jakob M.","subject":"Appetite; Bioactive phytochemicals; Fullness; Hunger; Plant extracts; Satiety;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Appetite-suppressing and satiety-increasing bioactive phytochemicals : a systematic review; Appetite; Bioactive phytochemicals; Fullness; Hunger; Plant extracts; Satiety;  Biochemie; The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide.

In this paper, we report on the initial phases of a process-oriented research project investigating student and professional translators' technical and information behavior in the workplace. The study, which forms part of the large-scale Capturing Translation Processes project at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences' Institute of Translation and Interpreting, adopts a multi-method approach which combines data from ethnographic observation of the translation situation, surveys and semi-structured interviews to determine self-reported practices, keystroke logging, computer screenshot recordings, cue-based retrospective verbalizations of recorded translation processes as well as additional techniques such as eye-tracking. The diverse aspects of translation processes we capture as students and professionals translate and revise their texts allow us to gain insight into their technical and information behavior by triangulating the data from observation, self-report, and computer recordings (cf. Ehrensberger-Dow & Massey , Ehrensberger-Dow & Perrin ).In the course of our research, we have identified instances where technological aids actually appear to interfere with the cognitive process of translation. In this paper, we indicate how research of this kind can help identify potential ergonomic problems inherent in the design of user interfaces, including those of standardized translation aids such as readily available online dictionaries. These can impede the efficiency of translation by both slowing down the translation process and diminishing the quality of the product, particularly amongst beginners. It is suggested that targeted instruction in technical and instrumental competence (cf. Massey et al. ) can counteract these effects, for example by raising translators? Awareness of the potential pitfalls of indiscriminate use of technology, teaching them how to optimize their workplace practices and thus helping them to meet their ergonomic needs.","doc_id":403,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15311","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Gene expression profiles of different breast cancer cells compared with their responsiveness to fermented mistletoe (Viscum album L.) extracts Iscador from oak (Quercus), pine (Pinus), white fir (Abies) and apple tree (Malus) in vitro","authors":"Eggenschwiler, Jenny; Patrignani, Andrea; Wagner, Ulrich; Rehrauer, Hubert; Schlapbach, Ralph; Rist, Lukas; Ramos, Mac; Viviani, Angelika","subject":"Cytotoxicity; Mistletoe; MCF-7;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"Gene expression profiles of different breast cancer cells compared with their responsiveness to fermented mistletoe (Viscum album L.) extracts Iscador from oak (Quercus), pine (Pinus), white fir (Abies) and apple tree (Malus) in vitro; Cytotoxicity; Mistletoe; MCF-;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; Cytotoxicity assays in vitro (MTT test) showed that the different breast cancer cell lines Kpl-, MCF- and Mfm- respond differently to the mistletoe (Viscum album L.) preparations Iscador.

Such differences can be analysed in more detail by looking at the gene expression using Human Whole Genome microarray chips (, genes). The results of the transcriptome analyses suggested that Iscador preparations influenced the overregulation of genes regarding immune defense, stress response, apoptosis and cell-cell adhesion pathways. Within the Mfm--Zellen was the Genexpression in MCF- and Kpl-. The MCF- cells were affected on the genes which are involved in cell-cell contacts whereas Kpl- responded to the mistletoe extracts by changing the mRNA levels of the immune and stress response pathways. Concerning the effects of the mistletoe extract, we conclude that Iscador Qu and M have a greater influence on the immune defense and stress response genes whereas Iscador A tends to affect the cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeleton pathways. In summary, cDNA microarray analyses give us information on whether a cancer cell is sensitive to mistletoe extracts in relation to how many genes are significantly overrepresented after mistletoe treatment, and whether a particular mistletoe extract is more effective on a specific cancer cell than the other preparation.","doc_id":467,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14455","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking in Switzerland from different points of view : protocol for a mixed-methods study","authors":"Stängle, Sabrina; Schnepp, Wilfried; Mezger, Mirjam; Büche, Daniel; Fringer, André","subject":"Cross-sectional study; Explorative descriptive qualitative research; Focus group interviews; Palliative care; Practical recommendation; Project protocol; Questionnaire; Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking;  Pflege","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610.73","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking in Switzerland from different points of view : protocol for a mixed-methods study; Cross-sectional study; Explorative descriptive qualitative research; Focus group interviews; Palliative care; Practical recommendation; Project protocol; Questionnaire; Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking;  Pflege; “To die with dignity” has reached the significance of a core value in democratic societies.

Stressbewältigung und Stressresistenz werden zunehmend in allen Lebensphasen und Settings gebraucht, um die psychische, körperliche und soziale Gesundheit zu erhalten. Fragestellungen: Das Ziel dieser Bachelorarbeit ist es, die gesellschaftliche Bedeutung von Stress im Arbeitsleben zu beleuchten, verschiedene Interventionsansätze zur Stressprävention aufzuzeigen sowie Empfehlungen für eine wirksame Stressprävention im betrieblichen Kontext abzuleiten.Methode: Zu Beginn wurde das genannte Ziel zur Themeneingrenzung durch eine selektive Literaturrecherche bearbeitet. Danach erfolgte eine systematische Literaturrecherche in fünf Datenbanken. Insgesamt wurden  Studien in die Arbeit miteinbezogen.Ergebnisse: Die bestehende empirische Evidenz verdeutlicht, dass Arbeitsstress ein prävalentes und ernst zu nehmendes Gesundheitsrisiko darstellt, das mit erheblichen gesellschaftlichen Kosten verbunden ist, sich aber, wie verschiedene Beispiele zeigen, mit entsprechenden Interventionen abmildern lässt. Durch die systematische Literaturrecherche wurden diverse Ansätze identifiziert, welche zu einer wirksamen Stressprävention beitragen können.Schlussfolgerung: Die Ergebnisse bezüglich wirksamer Interventionen zur Stressprävention sind heterogen. Dies kann praktisch nicht umgangen werden, da kein Betrieb und seine Mitarbeitenden je gleich sein werden.

In the present study, we marry the commonly used two-dimensional (D) technique of electrospinning and a self-assembly process to construct easily reproducible, highly porous, three-dimensional (D) nanofiber scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications. Specimens from biologically relevant polymers polycaprolactone (PCL) and gelatin were chemically cross-linked using the naturally occurring cross-linker genipin. Potential cytotoxic effects of the scaffolds were analyzed by culturing human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) up to  days. The D PCL/gelatin/genipin scaffolds produced here resemble the complex nanofibrous architecture found in naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM) and exhibit physiologically relevant mechanical properties as well as excellent cell cytocompatibility. Samples cross-linked with .% genipin demonstrated the highest metabolic activity and proliferation rates for HDF. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated excellent cell adhesion and the characteristic morphological features of fibroblasts in all tested samples.

Many of the more recent initiatives to improve patient safety target the behavior of health care staff (e.g., training, double-checking procedures, and standard operating procedures). System-based interventions have so  far received less attention, even though they produce more substantial improvements, being less dependent on individuals’ behavior. One type of system-based intervention that can benefit patient safety involves improvements to hospital design. Given that people’s working environments affect their behavior, good design at a systemic level not only enables staff to work more efficiently; it can also prevent errors and mishaps, which can have serious consequences for patients. While an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the effect of hospital design on patient safety, this knowledge is not easily accessible to clinicians, practitioners, risk managers, and other decision-makers, such as designers and architects of health care facilities. This is why the Swiss Patient Safety Foundation launched its project, “More Patient Safety by Design: Systemic Approaches for Hospitals,” which is presented in this chapter.","doc_id":1034,"prior":"health","posterior":"accessible","SDG3":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18046","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Choosing or rejecting a food item, does framing matter?

Consider two ways to select among food items (e.g., two cereal bars) based on their TLLs. You might choose between the two items or you might reject one of the two. Furthermore, differences between choose and reject might be driven more strongly by one factor (e.g., sugar) than by others. In Study  our participants made choose or reject decisions between food items with an all-orange TLL (all moderate) and a  red/ green TLL ( negative/ positive). Both items had equal energy/caloric content. We found that, independent of the condition (Choose/Reject), participants went home more often with the  red/ green item if sugar was green. This effect was stronger in the Choose than in the Reject condition. In Study , we additionally manipulated the energy content (low, high) of the items. In the case where both food items had a low energy content, similar results as in Study  were observed. If either or both items had high energy content, the choose/reject interaction with sugar disappeared. Only differences in energy content played a role in the reject condition. Overall, our results can be better explained by an “accentuation hypothesis” than by a “compatibility hypothesis”. These findings could be used by choice architects to fight the current obesity crisis.","doc_id":1042,"prior":"obesity","SDG3":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8833","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"How empowering is hospital care for older people with advanced disease?

The ethnography involved: interviews with patients aged ≥, informal caregivers, specialist palliative care (SPC) staff and other clinicians who cared for older adults with advanced disease, and fieldwork. Data were analysed using directed thematic analysis.Results: Analysis of  interviews and  h of observational data revealed substantial challenges to empowerment: poor communication and information provision, combined with routinised and fragmented inpatient care, restricted patients’ self-efficacy, self-management, choice and decision-making. Information and knowledge were often necessary for empowerment, but not sufficient: empowerment depended on patient-centredness being enacted at an organisational and staff level. SPC facilitated empowerment by prioritising patient-centred care, tailored communication and information provision, and the support of other clinicians.Conclusions: Empowering older people in the acute setting requires changes throughout the health system. Facilitators of empowerment include excellent staff-patient communication, patient-centred, relational care, an organisational focus on patient experience rather than throughput, and appropriate access to SPC. Findings have relevance for many high- and middle-income countries with a growing population of older patients with advanced disease.","doc_id":1050,"prior":"health","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8833","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"How empowering is hospital care for older people with advanced disease?

Up to now, such processes have mainly been small- or medium-scale mammalian cell culture-based seed inoculum, vaccine or antibody productions. However, recently first attempts have been made to modify existing single-use bioreactors for the cultivation of plant cells and tissue cultures, and microorganisms. This has even led to the development of new single-use bioreactor types. Moreover, due to safety issues it has become clear that single-use bioreactors are the “must have” for expanding human stem cells delivering cell therapeutics, the biopharmaceuticals of the next generation. So it comes as no surprise that numerous different dynamic single-use bioreactor types, which are suitable for a wide range of applications, already dominate the market today. Bioreactor working principles, main applications, and bioengineering data are presented in this review, based on a current overview of greater than milliliter-scale, commercially available, dynamic single-use bioreactors. The focus is on stirred versions, which are omnipresent in R&D and manufacturing, and in particular Sartorius Stedim’s BIOSTAT family. Finally, we examine development trends for single-use bioreactors, after discussing proven approaches for fast scaling-up processes.","doc_id":1067,"prior":"vaccine","SDG3":1},{"id":"56","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23943","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Patients' health & well-being in inpatient mental health-care facilities : a systematic review","authors":"Weber, Clara; Monero Flores, Virna; Wheele, Theresa Poppy; Miedema, Elke; White, Emma Victoria","subject":"Healing environment; Systematic review; Well-being; Mental health; Recovery outcome; Psychiatric hospital;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Patients' health & well-being in inpatient mental health-care facilities : a systematic review; Healing environment; Systematic review; Well-being; Mental health; Recovery outcome; Psychiatric hospital;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Background: Previous research indicates that the physical environment of healthcare facilities plays an important role in the health, well-being, and recovery outcomes of patients. However, prior works on mental healthcare facilities have incorporated physical environment effects from general healthcare settings and patient groups, which cannot be readily transferred to mental healthcare settings or its patients. There appears to be a specific need for evidence synthesis of physical environmental effects in mental healthcare settings by psychopathology.Purpose: This review evaluates the state (in terms of extent, nature and quality) of the current empirical evidence of physical environmental on mental health, well-being, and recovery outcomes in mental healthcare inpatients by psychopathology.Method: A systematic review (PRISMA guidelines) was performed of studies published in English, German, Dutch, Swedish, and Spanish, of all available years until September , searched in Cochrane, Ovid Index, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science and identified through extensive hand-picking. Inclusion criteria were: Adult patients being treated for mental ill-health (common mental health and mood disorders, Cochrane frame); inpatient mental health care facilities; specifications of the physical and socio-physical environment (e.g., design features, ambient conditions, privacy); all types of empirical study designs. Quality assessment and data synthesis were undertaken.Results: The search retrieved , titles of which  met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest that there is only indicative evidence of the impact of the physical healthcare environment on patients' mental health, well-being, and recovery outcomes. There is significant lack of pathology-specific evidence. Methodological shortcomings and empirical scarcity account for the poor evidence.Conclusion: This review highlights the need for more research using advanced study designs.","doc_id":1074,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"80","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/717","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Patienten-Partner Kommunikation und Lebensqualität nach einer Krebsdiagnose","authors":"Hotz, Isabel; Rüesch Ranganadan, Annia","subject":" Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"150","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Patienten-Partner Kommunikation und Lebensqualität nach einer Krebsdiagnose;  Psychologie","doc_id":1097,"prior":"Krebsdiagnose","SDG3":1},{"id":"81","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15384","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Real-world cost-utility analysis of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in Switzerland","authors":"Meier, Flurina; Brunner, Beatrice; Grobet, Cécile; Wieser, Simon; Audigé, Laurent; Flury, Matthias; Eichler, Klaus","subject":" Orthopädische Chirurgie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"617.5","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Real-world cost-utility analysis of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in Switzerland;  Orthopädische Chirurgie; Objectives: Knowledge about benefit and costs of orthopaedic interventions is important for patients, surgeons, health policy decision makers and health care payers.

This work demonstrates that assessment of CT image quality is feasible with the aforementioned phantom and DDC method.","doc_id":1298,"prior":"Medizin","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5832","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"HoNOSCA-D as a measure of the severity of diagnosed mental disorders in children and adolescents : psychometric properties of the German translation","authors":"von Wyl, Agnes; Toggweiler, Stephan; Zollinger, Ruedi","subject":"German-language version; HoNOSCA-D; ICD-10; Child; Mental disorder; Psychometrics; Validity; Adolescent;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie;  Pädiatrie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.89, 618.92","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"HoNOSCA-D as a measure of the severity of diagnosed mental disorders in children and adolescents : psychometric properties of the German translation; German-language version; HoNOSCA-D; ICD-; Child; Mental disorder; Psychometrics; Validity; Adolescent;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie;  Pädiatrie; The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA), in use worldwide, is a -item measure assessing the biopsychosocial severity of mental health problems in children and adolescents.

For the HoNOSCA-D total score (severity of mental health problems), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was .. The discriminative power of the items ranged from . to .; the average interitem correlation was .. Due to this stochastic independence, calculation of a total severity index is acceptable. Using factor analysis, the principal axis factoring and varimax rotation resulted in a four-factor structure, which with a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy of . explained .% of total variance. The convergent correlations with the German-language parent report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were as expected and showed a medium effect size. Gender and age differences in the HoNOSCA-D total score were small. Regarding the  items gender and age differences were negligible to medium. The highest severity was found for schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, followed by affective disorders and social behavior disorders. Overall, validity of HoNOSCA-D was clearly supported.","doc_id":1308,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5365","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Antidepressant prescription rates and suicide attempt rates from 2004 to 2016 in a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the USA","authors":"Plöderl, M.; Hengartner, Michael Pascal","subject":" Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Antidepressant prescription rates and suicide attempt rates from  to  in a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the USA;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","doc_id":1320,"prior":"suicide","SDG3":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13892","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Gene expression signatures predictive of bevacizumab/erlotinib therapeutic benefit in advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer patients (SAKK 19/05 trial)","authors":"Franzini, Anca; Baty, Florent; Macovei, Ina I.; Dürr, Oliver; Droege, Cornelia; Betticher, Daniel; Grigoriu, Bogdan D.; Klingbiel, Dirk; Zappa, Francesco; Brutsche, Martin H.","subject":"Gene expression;  Biochemie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 616","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Gene expression signatures predictive of bevacizumab/erlotinib therapeutic benefit in advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer patients (SAKK / trial); Gene expression;  Biochemie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Purpose: We aimed to identify gene expression signatures associated with angiogenesis and hypoxia pathways with predictive value for treatment response to bevacizumab/erlotinib (BE) of nonsquamous advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Experimental Design: Whole-genome gene expression profiling was performed on  biopsy samples (from SAKK / trial) using Affymetrix exon arrays, and associations with the following endpoints: time-to-progression (TTP) under therapy, tumor-shrinkage (TS), and overall survival (OS) were investigated. Next, we performed gene set enrichment analyses using genes associated with the angiogenic process and hypoxia response to evaluate their predictive value for patients' outcome.Results: Our analysis revealed that both the angiogenic and hypoxia response signatures were enriched within the genes predictive of BE response, TS, and OS. Higher gene expression levels (GEL) of the -gene angiogenesis-associated signature and lower levels of the -gene hypoxia response signature predicted improved TTP under BE, . months versus . months for low versus high-risk patients (P = .), and median TTP . months versus . months (P = .), respectively.

However, it is still unclear which position is the most favourable, respectively which factor can explain the variety of different position effects observed (e.g., centre-stage effect). We assume that this factor is based on whether or not “your love” (or your preference) for the cuisine of the restaurant (e.g., Italian) where you have dinner plays a role regarding your dish choice or not. Hence, in a computer-based study, participants had to choose dishes, appetizers, entrées and desserts from menus whose cuisine they most (e.g., Italian) or least preferred (e.g., Japanese). We found that regarding the meal type entrées, preference indeed played a role. Regarding menus from their most preferred cuisine, participants chose significantly more often entrées positioned in the centre of the menu. No such effect could be found regarding menus from their least preferred cuisine. Regarding the meal type appetizer, preference did not seem to play a role; hence, participants did, regarding both preferences, choose more appetizers positioned at the top of the menu. Regarding desserts, no effects could be found. A developed theoretical framework tries to illustrate how preference comes into play, by changing the way the dishes within a meal type are perceived, and hence modulates the different position effects observed. The framework should provide choice architects with guidelines about where they could place healthier dishes on a menu to fight the current overweight and obesity crisis.","doc_id":1442,"prior":"obesity","SDG3":1},{"id":"55","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19974","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"What explains the inequalities in healthcare use between immigrants and natives in Switzerland?","authors":"Tzogiou, Christina; Boes, Stefan; Brunner, Beatrice","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"What explains the inequalities in healthcare use between immigrants and natives in Switzerland?;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Background: Even in a high income country, such as Switzerland, immigrants tend to suffer higher rates of mortality and morbidity compared to natives.

Accordingly, the chances of individuals with mental disabilities of becoming economically independent are often constraint and their social integration is hampered. This situation impairs their well-being which in turn is likely to exacerbate their mental health.One of the reasons for the limited occupational achievements of individuals with mental disorders is their lack of educational degrees. They may have dropped out of school, have achieved only low levels of education or have graduated from schools for children with special needs. Their educational attainments thus often do not allow them to take up standard jobs.Our paper addresses the question how mental health interventions in children with mental disabilities are linked to their labor market outcomes. We analyze whether there are educational and vocational programs or psychiatric interventions that mitigate the negative impact of mental disorders on educational and occupational outcomes. Moreover, we examine which consecution of educational and psychotherapeutic measures enhances young adults’ chances to be in employment at age .

Um das genannte Ziel zu erreichen, wurde eine systematisierte Literaturrecherche in den pflegerelevanten Datenbanken CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline und PsychInfo durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das Aufrechterhalten von ausserfamiliären Sozialbeziehungen zu Freunden sowie in Vereinen und Selbsthilfegruppen, die Förderung von individuellen Coping-Strategien, die Anerkennung für das Empfundene und die Förderung der Gesundheit, Ansätze zur Unterstützung dieser Patientengruppe im ambulanten Setting sind.Das verdeutlicht zugleich, dass die Umsetzung der Ergebnisse in die Spitex-Praxis ein vertieftes Fachwissen zum Verstehen der seelischen, körperlichen, verhaltensbezogenen und sozialen Konsequenzen des Partnerverlusts im hohen Alter erfordert.","doc_id":1550,"prior":"Lebenserwartung","SDG3":1},{"id":"39","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17668","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Opinions and outlooks on morphological computation","authors":"Hauser, Helmut; Füchslin, Rudolf Marcel; Pfeifer, Rolf","subject":"Morphoological Computation; Robotics; Simulation; Bio - inspired engineering;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Buch","bid":"620","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Opinions and outlooks on morphological computation; Morphoological Computation; Robotics; Simulation; Bio - inspired engineering;  Ingenieurwesen; This book is published jointly by the editors Helmut Hauser, Rudolf M. Füchslin and Rolf Pfeifer. It is a free ebook and distribution is encouraged.; Morphological Computation is based on the observation that biological systems seem to carry out relevant computations with their morphology (physical body) in order to successfully interact with their environments. This can be observed in a whole range of systems and at many different scales. It has been studied in animals – e.g., while running, the functionality of coping with impact and slight unevenness in the ground is \"delivered\" by the shape of the legs and the damped elasticity of the muscle-tendon system – and plants, but it has also been observed at the cellular and even at the molecular level – as seen, for example, in spontaneous self-assembly. The concept of morphological computation has served as an inspirational resource to build bio-inspired robots, design novel approaches for support systems in health care, implement computation with natural systems, but also in art and architecture. As a consequence, the field is highly interdisciplinary, which is also nicely reflected in the wide range of authors that are featured in this e-book. We have contributions from robotics, mechanical engineering, health, architecture, biology, philosophy, and others. On one hand, the beautiful richness of this interdisciplinarity has a lot of potential, but on the other, it poses a number of serious challenges. For example, people with different backgrounds have a different understanding of the concepts involved. They use different terms for the same ideas or, even more problematic, they use the same terms to mean something often substantially different. Also, the tools and methods are frequently quite apart, as illustrated, e.g., by engineering and neuroscience. Nevertheless, we strongly believe that this interdisciplinarity is a big opportunity, which enables the field to grow and to cross-fertilize. Scientists from other areas can provide novel points of view, they can challenge long standing, many times implicit and unquestioned assumptions inherent to a field, and they can help to find disruptive approaches to solve notorious problems. We would even argue that a lot of times truly novel and seminal work happens exactly at the intersection of different fields. Based on the strong belief that – if done right – interdisciplinary research can be enormously productive we had initiated this e-book.The intention was to collect opinions on morphological computation from researchers from a broad range of research as well cultural backgrounds. Instead of the formal style of publications of scientific results, we wanted to provide a rather informal environment where people can present their point of view on morphological computation, its future trajectory and its possibly far-reaching implications. The book should be an inspirational resource and it should allow for cross-fertilization between different disciplines. One of our goals was to make sure that the contributions are written in a style accessible for a broad audience. Moreover, it was clear from the very beginning that this e-book should be available for free to lower the threshold to read it. In our opinion we have been able to meet the objectives of the e-book, especially, because of the help of all authors who took the effort to write excellent contributions.We are truly grateful for all their work and we also appreciate their patience to \"hang in there\" with us so long. Finally, we hope that this colorful collection of thoughts will inspire researchers, engineers, students, teachers, and anyone with an interest in scientific debate, alike and will generate a lot of discussion and ultimately novel scientific topics.","doc_id":1618,"prior":"health","posterior":"accessible","SDG3":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3781","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Health status inequality among immigrants in Switzerland","authors":"Volken, Thomas; Rüesch, Peter","subject":"Health status; Impairment; Immigrant; Switzerland;  Soziale Gruppen;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"305, 610","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Health status inequality among immigrants in Switzerland; Health status; Impairment; Immigrant; Switzerland;  Soziale Gruppen;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Objective: To assess self-rated health and impairments for six large immigrant groups (Germany, Italy, Kosovo, Portugal, Serbia, Turkey) in Switzerland.

The basic requirements relate to not feeding food to livestock and treating animals respectfully, increasing the variety of plant crops, producing according to the principles of organic farming, and providing nature with more space. As a result, promotional pictures of agriculture become a reality. Soil-independent industrial animal husbandry disappears, all animals have access to pastures, and dual-use cattle breeds are only fed with fodder from meadows and pastures. Annual milk production drops from  to  kg per head but remains the main branch of agricultural activity, while beef becomes a by-product of dairy. Annual meat production decreases from  kg to  kg per head. A total of  kilocalories can still be generated per head and per day,  percent of which comes from plant-based foods. Since arable land is very scarce in Switzerland, with an average of . ares per head compared to . ares per head in the European Union or . ares in the U.S, any increase in agricultural production is the result of an intensification with considerable environmental costs. This finding contradicts the widespread belief that ‘our country is best’. The study concludes that food should be produced where the resources are. This result does not mean that more meat should be imported. Rather, the solution is to reduce meat consumption to an ecologically sustainable and arguably healthier level.","doc_id":1679,"prior":"healthier","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1007","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Umgang mit älteren alkoholabhängigen, pflegebedürftigen Bewohnerinnen und Bewohnern in Pflegeinstitutionen","authors":"Konrad-Steiner, Anna Kristina","subject":"alcoholism; elderly people; nursing home; support; interventions;  Pflege","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610.73","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Umgang mit älteren alkoholabhängigen, pflegebedürftigen Bewohnerinnen und Bewohnern in Pflegeinstitutionen; alcoholism; elderly people; nursing home; support; interventions;  Pflege; Die Zahl älterer alkoholabhängiger Menschen wird künftig ansteigen und sich zu einem zunehmenden Gesundheitsproblem entwickeln.

Methods: Randomized controlled trial using parallel group block randomization including  patients with ≤ hospitalizations within the last  years, a GAF score ≤, and aged - years, assessed at two psychiatric hospitals from the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between September  and February . Primary outcomes were rate and duration of rehospitalization; secondary outcomes were mental health and functioning. Outcome measures were assessed before discharge from the index hospitalization (t),  months after discharge when the intervention terminated (t), and  months after discharge (t). Participants received either a brief case management post-discharge intervention or treatment as usual. Results: In the short-term (i.e., t-t), no significant effect emerged in any outcome. In the long term (i.e., t-t), the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the rate and duration of rehospitalization. Also, the intervention did not reduce psychiatric symptoms, did not improve social support, and did not improve quality of life. However, it did slightly increase assessor-rated general (d = .) and social functioning (d = .), although self-reports revealed a deteriorative effect on symptom remission (d = -.). Conclusion: This psychosocial post-discharge intervention showed no efficacy in the primary outcome of rehospitalization. With respect to secondary outcomes, in the long term it might lead to slightly increased social functioning but revealed no significant effect on psychopathology, social support, and quality of life. By contrast, with respect to self-reported symptom remission, it was revealed to have a negative effect.

Die wenigen Forschungen zeigen auf, dass trans Menschen tendenziell häufiger Diskriminierungen und Ungleichheiten erleben, geringeres Wohlbefinden und eine schlechtere psychische Gesundheit aufweisen als cis Menschen. Infolgedessen erhebt die vorliegende Arbeit die Bedürfnisse der trans Menschen an eine bessere Lebenssituation.

This paper presents the results of the workshop related to three key questions: () what are the benefits of ecological engineering practices to human and ecosystem well-being, () which concepts are used or useful to identify, reference, and measure the benefits of ecological engineering practices, and () how and to whom shall benefits of ecological engineering practices be promoted. While benefits of ecological engineering practices are diverse, general conclusions can be derived to facilitate communication. Identifying benefits requires valuation frameworks reaching beyond the scope of ecology and engineering. A distinction between human and ecosystem well-being in this regard may not be easy or useful, but instead humans embedded in ecosystems should be addressed as a whole. The concepts of resource efficiency, ecosystem services, ecosystem health, and multifunctional land use could serve as suitable references to frame ecological engineering benefits, as well as referring to international political goals such as biodiversity protection, climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. Sector and application specific criteria of good practice could be worked out. Regional, area specific reference systems for sustainable development could provide comparative advantages for ecologically engineered solutions.

The data indicate that Salmonella can be efficiently eliminated by the application of phage cocktails containing a minimum of two phage isolates, while treatment of the bacteria with only a single phage isolate often resulted in regrowth of the treated culture.","doc_id":2027,"prior":"diarrhea","SDG3":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15305","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Paediatic medulloblastoma cells are susceptible to Viscum album L.

(mistletoe) preparations; Viscum; Tumour; Medulloblastoma; Brain;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Background: Medulloblastoma constitute more than % of all paediatric brain tumours and are the most common malignant brain tumours in children. Adjuvant chemotherapy has seen a strong increase in the use of complementary medicine for cancer treatment. Evidence for cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of Viscum album (Mistletoe) in vitro is available, however, no data concerning paediatric tumours, especially paediatric brain tumours, has been provided so far.Materials and methods: In order to compare the receptiveness of medulloblastoma cells to different Viscum album preparations, in vitro cytotoxic effects of eight Viscum album extracts on four different paediatric medulloblastoma cell lines were analysed by MTT-Tests. Lectin contents of the extracts were determined to correlate them with the mitochondrial activity of mistletoe-treated cells. Flowcytometric analyses with Annexin V-FITC staining were carried out to quantify the amount of apoptotic cells compared to necrotic and viable cells.Results: Data obtained with the medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy, D, D and UW--, treated with Viscum album preparations from eight dissimilar host trees (Iscucin Abietis, Pini, Populi, Mali, Salicis, Crataegi, Quercus and Tiliae), indicated a significant growth-inhibition of all cell lines, yet the cell susceptibility was dissimilar against the different extracts. The decrease in mitochondrial activity and increase in apoptosis correlated with the lectin content of the used preparation in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusion: These in vitro results show that paediatric medulloblastoma cells respond to Viscum album preparations, by undergoing cell death through apoptosis and that this growth-inhibition correlates with the lectin content of the used preparation.","doc_id":2074,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7684","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Zusammenhang von Fallzahlen und Behandlungsqualität in Schweizer Akutspitälern","authors":"Pfister, Christian","subject":" Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"362.11","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Zusammenhang von Fallzahlen und Behandlungsqualität in Schweizer Akutspitälern;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen; Die Annahme, dass die medizinische Behandlungsqualität in Spitälern mit hohen Fallzahlen besser ist als in solchen mit tiefen Fallzahlen, ist weit verbreitet und belegt.

September, \".; Information technology offers professional translators indispensable support by providing them with the powerful, efficient tools needed: - to meet a widening range of customer requirements (source-text and target-text delivery in various DTP formats on a variety of storage media and/or by e-mail and file attachment); - to conduct the branching operations which characterise the translation process itself (dictionaries, encyclopaedias and other reference works on CD-ROM; access to on-line termbanks, information services and translation forums; BBS and Internet access); - to develop user-specific terminology databases (with terminology management systems like MultiTerm). In addition, advances in the development of CAT tools (such as Translator's Workbench) present translators of technical texts with a real opportunity to increase productivity and ensure a much higher degree of terminological accuracy and consistency in their work. It goes without saying that any translator training institute or programme has a duty to teach students the IT skills they need to compete in the market, and institutes have largely risen to this challenge by building separate IT and CAT courses into their curriculum. This article considers a more integrated approach to IT, CAT and general translator training. It suggests a method - centred on teacher-operated computer-screen projection - by which computer-based instruction can take place in every classroom where translation is taught. Computer-screen projection offers distinct advantages over methods employing traditional teaching aids by creating a framework in which: - students are encouraged to develop and refine skills acquired in parallel IT and CAT courses (both by in-class observation of systems in action and by the practical necessity of submitting formatted translations on diskette or via e-mail); - process-oriented learning and product-oriented teaching are effectively combined in a technique allowing multiple translations to be generated, evaluated and corrected by the translators themselves, their peers and/or their teacher; - much-neglected proofreading and consistency-monitoring skills are repeatedly applied to large segments of text; - suggested versions can be validated on-screen through the rapid retrieval of information from hard drives, CD-ROMs or on-line services; - terminology databases can be created and managed for or by each group; - a printed 'protocol' of each lesson can be distributed to students (together with terminology lists and appropriate follow-up exercises); - the teacher has the scope to switch from student-centred learning to teacher-centred instruction as the situation requires.","doc_id":2166,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"33","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12875","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Diagnostic value of systematic biopsy methods in the investigation of prostate cancer : a systematic review","authors":"Eichler, Klaus; Hempel, Susanne; Wilby, Jennifer; Myers, Lindsey; Bachmann, Lucas M.; Kleijnen, Jos","subject":"Prostate; Prostatic neoplasms; Biopsy;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"Diagnostic value of systematic biopsy methods in the investigation of prostate cancer : a systematic review; Prostate; Prostatic neoplasms; Biopsy;  Medizin und Gesundheit","doc_id":2182,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1006","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Nicht schon wieder so ein „Alki“! : Empfehlungen für Interventionen zur Reduktion der Stigmata seitens des Pflegefachpersonals","authors":"Menard, Tamara; von Arx, Gabriela","subject":"Stigma / attitude(s); stigma; discrimination; stereotypes; Alkoholabhängigkeit / alcohol dependence; alcoholism; alcoholics; Antistigma / anti-stigma; Pflegefachpersonen / nurse; Akutspital / acute care; hospital;  Pflege","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610.73","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Nicht schon wieder so ein „Alki“! : Empfehlungen für Interventionen zur Reduktion der Stigmata seitens des Pflegefachpersonals; Stigma / attitude(s); stigma; discrimination; stereotypes; Alkoholabhängigkeit / alcohol dependence; alcoholism; alcoholics; Antistigma / anti-stigma; Pflegefachpersonen / nurse; Akutspital / acute care; hospital;  Pflege; Darstellung des Themas: Das Pflegefachpersonal zeigt sich häufig unwillig und unfähig, alkoholabhängigen Patienten Empathie entgegenzubringen. Deshalb erfahren alkoholabhängige Patienten während ihrer Hospitalisierung vom Pflegefachpersonal oft ungenügend Unterstützung und sind stigmatisierenden Verhaltensweisen ausgesetzt. Dies beeinträchtigt die Pflegequalität und führt zu geringeren Therapieerfolgen. Zudem wird das Selbstwertgefühl der Betroffenen gemindert.

Given the social gradient in life expectancy and health, it is important to understand the potential late-life health effects of prolonging working life and whether any effects differ by socioeconomic position. We examined the effect of prolonging working life beyond age  on mortality and a series of indicators of late-life physical health (the ability to climb stairs without difficulty, self-rated health, ADL limitations, and musculoskeletal pain) in a representative sample of the Swedish population. In addition to average effects, we also examined heterogeneous effects, for instance by occupational social class. To do this, we use propensity score matching, a method suitable for addressing causality in observational data. The data came from two linked Swedish longitudinal surveys based on nationally representative samples with repeated follow-ups; The Swedish Level of Living Survey and the Swedish Panel Study of Living conditions of the Oldest Old, and from national income and mortality registries.

Accordingly, more detailed knowledge about the precise mechanisms underlying these results are needed.

Methods We performed a prospective observational study with a propensity score-matched usual care control group from a claims database. We included type- and type- diabetes patients from a primary care setting. The DMP (intervention) comprised a structured treatment approach with an individual treatment plan, treatment goals and an interprofessional team approach. Our outcome comprehensive measures included quality of life (QOL: EQ-D-L), pre-defined indicators for diabetes guideline adherence, number of used services and direct medical costs. We applied a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to compare DMP with usual care (follow-up  year). Costs were calculated with non-parametric bootstrapping ( Swiss Francs, CHF; conversion rate to Euros: .) from a third-party payer perspective (Swiss health care insurance). Results QOL in a sub-sample of  patients did not change during follow-up (mean utility . at baseline and follow-up; p=.). Guideline adherence showed slight improvements for DMP. For example, non-adherence (baseline DMP: %) decreased in the DMP group by - %-points (DID; %-CI: -. to .) but not in the control group. A general trend emerged, though mostly not statistically significant, with less used services in the DMP group compared to the control group.

Da mögliche Schäden jedoch nicht ausgeschlossen werden können, wird empfohlen den Alkoholkonsum während der Schwangerschaft einzustellen. Studien zeigen jedoch, dass auf europäischer Ebene ca. % der Frauen weiterhin Alkohol während der Schwangerschaft konsumieren, eine Zahl die in der Schweiz auf ca. % geschätzt wird. Unsere Studie hat daher zum Ziel, die Risikowahrnehmung werdender Eltern in Bezug auf den Alkoholkonsum während der Schwangerschaft und Stillzeit in einer soziokulturellen Perspektive zu untersuchen.Von Dezember  bis Mai  wurden mit  Paaren aus der französisch- und deutschsprachigen Schweiz qualitative Einzelinterviews geführt. Werdende Mütter und Väter wurden während der Schwangerschaft in ihrer Landessprache befragt, wobei die Mütter zusätzlich ein zweites Mal zwischen drei und fünf Monaten nach der Geburt interviewt wurden. Die Interviews wurden transkribiert, mit Atlas.Ti inhaltsanalytisch ausgewertet und mithilfe von Synthesen erarbeitet.Erste Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die befragten schwangeren Frauen ihren Alkoholkonsum einstellen bzw. weitgehend reduzieren. Dabei berichteten die Frauen einerseits Gefühle der Zufriedenheit, die Abstinenznorm eingehalten zu haben, andererseits wurden Situationen beschrieben, in welchen Abstinenz als Einschränkung der Soziabilität erlebt wurde. Die befragten Väter unterstützen die Entscheidung ihrer Partnerin in der Regel, stellten den eigenen Alkoholkonsum allerdings nicht ein. Es konnten zwei Strategien herausgearbeitet werden, denen die Frauen bei der Umstellung zur Abstinenz bzw. zur Reduktion des Alkoholkonsums folgten. Entweder wurde eine Obergrenze des Alkoholkonsums definiert, wie z.B. die Abstinenz oder ein regelmässiger limitierter Konsum, oder die Frauen entschieden sich situationsabhängig, ob sie Alkohol konsumieren oder nicht. Alle drei Strategien gingen mit Schuldgefühlen einher. Dabei zeigte sich auch, dass Verletzungen der Abstinenznorm häufig mit dem Partner bzw. dem näheren sozialen Umfeld verhandelt wurden und kaum Gegenstand von Beratungsgesprächen mit Fachpersonen waren.Unsere Resultate weisen darauf hin, dass die gesundheitlichen Empfehlungen zum Alkoholkonsum bekannt sind, dass der Umgang mit Alkohol im Alltag, jedoch massgeblich vom sozialen Umfeld mitbeeinflusst wird. Diesem Umstand sollte in der Beratung durch Hebammen, Ärztinnen und Ärzten im Rahmen der Schwangerenvorsorge Rechnung getragen werden.","doc_id":2330,"prior":"Alkoholkonsum","SDG3":1},{"id":"7","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19074","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Sensitive to critical incidents : the development and validation of the Swiss CSI-HC : a client satisfaction measure for homecare services in Switzerland","authors":"Hollenstein, Eva; Schmelzer, Sarah; Liberatore, Florian","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"362","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Sensitive to critical incidents : the development and validation of the Swiss CSI-HC : a client satisfaction measure for homecare services in Switzerland;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Background: Homecare services for the elderly and chronically ill are becoming increasingly important in many western countries, including Switzerland. Surveys of client satisfaction with services are conducted using various measurement instruments, some of which do not meet scientific quality criteria. In particular, the validity of existing measures is often questioned because less sensitive and favorable ratings lead to ceiling effects.Objectives: Development and validation of a satisfaction measure for homecare services in Switzerland which reflects (i) the service experience of clients, (ii) is sensitive to critical incidents, and (iii) offers a high explanatory power for overall satisfaction with homecare services.Method: After a step-by-step scale development process, the prototype was field-tested in a survey of Swiss homecare clients (sample n = ,). To assess validity, the ratings on the CSI-HC measure were compared with client-stated data on the occurrence of critical incidents, stated client experience, and the affective state of the client in relation to the homecare provider.Findings: The items of the measure explain a high proportion of overall satisfaction with homecare services. Furthermore, the measure appears to be sensitive to the occurrence of critical incidents and reflects the stated qualitative client experience very well. The measure correlates highly with affective satisfaction assessed on the SAM scale.Contribution to the research field: This study presents a mixed-method approach for the validation of a sensitive client satisfaction measure in healthcare management and public health research using the example of a measure for the Swiss homecare sector.","doc_id":2339,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2044","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Associations between domains of physical activity, sitting time, and different measures of overweight and obesity","authors":"Wanner, Miriam; Martin, Brian W.; Autenrieth, Christine S.; Schaffner, Emmanuel; Meier, Flurina; Brombach, Christine; Stolz, Daiana; Bauman, Adrian; Rochat, Thierry; Schindler, Christian; Kriemler, Susi; Probst-Hensch, Nicole","subject":"Adults; Domains of physical activity; Switzerland; Bioelectric impedance analysis;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610, 616","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Associations between domains of physical activity, sitting time, and different measures of overweight and obesity; Adults; Domains of physical activity; Switzerland; Bioelectric impedance analysis;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Open Acess Journal; Objective: To describe ) cross-sectional associations between domain-specific physical activity, sitting time and different measures of overweight/obesity and ) longitudinal associations between patterns of change in physical activity and overweight/obesity ten years later. Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses based on the first and second follow-up of the Swiss cohort study SAPALDIA (SAP) were conducted (SAP in /, SAP in /). Physical activity was assessed by self-report using the long International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and four short questions regarding moderate and vigorous activities. Overweight/obesity were defined based on body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and percent body fat based on bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), all measured objectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used for analyses. Results: Cross-sectionally, leisure-time and vigorous physical activity were inversely associated with all obesity parameters. Most consistent associations were found with BIA percent body fat. There were no associations between work-related and domestic activities and overweight/obesity. Sitting time was positively associated with BIA percent body fat, but not with BMI, WHR and WHtR. Longitudinally, remaining inactive from SAP to SAP was associated with obesity and BIA percent body fat at SAP and with weight increase, becoming inactive with BIA percent body fat and weight increase. Conclusions: The results support associations between physical activity and overweight/obesity cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Most consistent associations were found for BIA percent body fat. For prevention purposes, the results indicate that physical activity can have an important contribution to weight management.","doc_id":2346,"prior":"obesity","SDG3":1},{"id":"15","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6807","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Alzheimer's disease-related overexpression of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor increases Aβ secretion : role for altered lysosomal hydrolase distribution in β-amyloidogenesis","authors":"Mathews, Paul M.; Guerra, Carolyn B.; Jiang, Ying; Grbovic, Olivera M.; Kao, Benjamin H.; Schmidt, Stephen D.; Dinakar, Ravi; Mercken, Marc; Hille-Rehfeld, Annette; Rohrer, Jack; Mehta, Pankaj; Cataldo, Anne M.; Nixon, Ralph A.","subject":" Physiologie und verwandte Themen;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"571, 572","year":"2002","for_data_analysis":"Alzheimer's disease-related overexpression of the cation-dependent mannose -phosphate receptor increases Aβ secretion : role for altered lysosomal hydrolase distribution in β-amyloidogenesis;  Physiologie und verwandte Themen;  Biochemie; Prominent endosomal and lysosomal changes are an invariant feature of neurons in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We present the main principles and procedures of a CBA of public health interventions according to the current state of the art and report the main difficulties. Furthermore, we introduce the framework of a CBA and the categories of costs and benefits. There are several different concepts to measure benefits in terms of final health outcome and to value benefits in monetary terms.

These responses exert strong selective pressures on different parts of HIV's genome, and select for mutations that escape recognition and are thus beneficial to the virus. Some studies reveal that the later these escape mutations emerge, the more slowly they go to fixation. This pattern of escape rate decrease(ERD) can arise by distinct mechanisms. In particular, in large populations with high beneficial mutation rates interference among different escape strains – an effect that can emerge in evolution with asexual reproduction and results in delayed fixation times of beneficial mutations compared to sexual reproduction – could significantly impact the escape rates of mutations. In this paper, we investigated how interference between these concurrent escape mutations affects their escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes, and whether it could be a source of the ERD pattern. To address these issues, we developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation and recombination, serving as a null-model for interference. We also derived an interference-free null model assuming initial neutral evolution before immune response elicitation. We found that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern. We also found that the number of loci, as well as recombination rates substantially affect ERD. These effects can be explained by the underexponential decline of escape rates over time. Lastly, we found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations as well as interference effects. Our results confirm that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations. The challenge in estimating escape rates and mutation-associated selective coefficients posed by interference effects cannot simply be overcome by improved sampling frequencies or sizes. This problem is a consequence of the fundamental shortcomings of current estimation techniques under interference regimes. Hence, accounting for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations demands novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains, rather than mutation frequencies.","doc_id":2615,"prior":"human immunodeficiency virus","SDG3":1},{"id":"15","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18337","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Ergotherapie für Erwachsene mit Sehbehinderung : die Kompetenzen und Aufgaben der Ergotherapie in der interprofessionellen Rehabilitation von Erwachsenen mit Sehbehinderung","authors":"Hofer, Lena; Schnüriger, Sandra","subject":"Occupational therapy; Competence; Interprofessional; Low Vision Rehabilitation;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Ergotherapie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610, 615.8515","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Ergotherapie für Erwachsene mit Sehbehinderung : die Kompetenzen und Aufgaben der Ergotherapie in der interprofessionellen Rehabilitation von Erwachsenen mit Sehbehinderung; Occupational therapy; Competence; Interprofessional; Low Vision Rehabilitation;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Ergotherapie; Altersbedingte Sehbehinderungen kommen durch die zunehmende Lebenserwartung in der Schweiz immer häufiger vor.

Research with professionals at the workplace suggests that there is potential to optimise the ergonomics of certain features of computer-aided translation tools. An exploratory study of the usability of two such tools with very different interfaces was carried out with students enrolled in a Master of Arts (MA) programme in translation. Quantitative measures from process monitoring software and qualitative indicators from post-task interviews highlight how students interacted with the two tools as they translated comparable source texts. The process measures and the comments suggest that the CAT tool with the leaner interface might be easier for students to use. In-depth analyses of three pairs of comparable segments support this finding, as do the evaluations of the target text segments by a separate cohort of MA students. We consider the implications of our findings in light of recent calls for improved cognitive, physical, and organisational ergonomics at the translation workplace.","doc_id":2907,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"65","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/682","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Entwickeln Menschen nach der Diagnosestellung einer onkologischen Erkrankung eine posttraumatische Belastungsstörung und welches sind mögliche Risikofaktoren?","authors":"Ledergerber, Maya","subject":"Psychoonkologie; Krebs (Medizin); Posttraumatisches Stresssyndrom;  Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"150","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Entwickeln Menschen nach der Diagnosestellung einer onkologischen Erkrankung eine posttraumatische Belastungsstörung und welches sind mögliche Risikofaktoren?; Psychoonkologie; Krebs (Medizin); Posttraumatisches Stresssyndrom;  Psychologie","doc_id":2954,"prior":"Krebs","SDG3":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18495","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Der Einfluss von tiergestützten Interventionen mit Hunden auf die gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität von Kindern und Jugendlichen während ihrer stationären Krebstherapie","authors":"Amsler, Sonja; Di Pierro, Lara","subject":"Animal-assisted intervention/activity/therapy; Well-being; Good health; Wellness; Dog; Children's hospital; Hospitalise/hospitalize; Child(ren)/infant; Oncology; Cancer;  Ergotherapie;  Pädiatrie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.8515, 618.92","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Der Einfluss von tiergestützten Interventionen mit Hunden auf die gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität von Kindern und Jugendlichen während ihrer stationären Krebstherapie; Animal-assisted intervention/activity/therapy; Well-being; Good health; Wellness; Dog; Children's hospital; Hospitalise/hospitalize; Child(ren)/infant; Oncology; Cancer;  Ergotherapie;  Pädiatrie; In der Schweiz erkranken jährlich  Kinder und Jugendliche unter  Jahren an Krebs.

Die Fragestellung dazu lautet: Welcher Einfluss von tiergestützten Interventionen mit Hunden auf die gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität von Kindern und Jugendlichen während ihrer stationären Krebstherapie wird in der Literatur beschrieben? Zur Beantwortung wurde eine Literaturrecherche durchgeführt. Die ausgewählte Literatur wurde mittels „Arbeitsinstrument für ein Critical Appraisal“ zusammengefasst und beurteilt. Tiergestützte Interventionen mit Hunden sind für viele hospitalisierte krebskranke Kinder und Jugendliche hilfreiche begleitende Behandlungsmethoden.

Wissenschaftliche Studien belegen, dass der Kontakt mit Hunden die Lebensqualität von krebskranken Patientinnen und Patienten verbessern kann.  Die vorliegende Arbeit verfolgt das Ziel, den Einfluss von tiergestützten Interventionen mit Hunden auf die gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität von Kindern und Jugendlichen während ihrer stationären Krebstherapie zu analysieren, zu erörtern und aufzuzeigen. Die Fragestellung dazu lautet: Welcher Einfluss von tiergestützten Interventionen mit Hunden auf die gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität von Kindern und Jugendlichen während ihrer stationären Krebstherapie wird in der Literatur beschrieben? Zur Beantwortung wurde eine Literaturrecherche durchgeführt. Die ausgewählte Literatur wurde mittels „Arbeitsinstrument für ein Critical Appraisal“ zusammengefasst und beurteilt.

We recently developed anti-fungal cultures with the capacity to inhibit the growth of mycotoxigenic filamentous fungi on cocoa beans. However, it is not clear how these anti-fungal cultures affect the fermentation process and cocoa bean quality. For that, the anti-fungal co-cultures, Lactobacillus fermentum M-Saccharomyces cerevisiae H (A) and Lb. fermentum -S. cerevisiae H (B), were applied to -kg box fermentations in Honduras in three time-independent replications each including a spontaneous control fermentation. The comparison of inoculated and spontaneous fermentation processes revealed that the co-cultures only arginally affected the fermentation process and cocoa bean quality. Microorganisms reached maximal levels of .–. log CFU/g of yeasts and acetic acid bacteria and .–. log CFU/g of lactic acid bacteria during all fermentations and led to maximal metabolite concentrations in bean cotyledons of – mg/g ethanol, – mg/g lactic acid and – mg/g acetic acid. The fermentation and drying processes resulted in – mg epicatechin equivalents/g in the cotyledons of dried beans. However, the co-cultures led to up to ten times higher mannitol levels in cotyledons of inoculated beans compared to beans during spontaneous fermentation, and caused a slower fermentation process, detectable as up to – ˚C lower temperatures in the centre of the fermenting pulp-bean mass and up to % lower proportions of well-fermented beans after drying. Co-culture B–with Lb. fermentum  –led to improved cocoa bean quality compared to co-culture A–with Lb. fermentum M –, i.e. cocoa beans with .–. mg/g less acetic acid, –% higher shares of well-fermented beans and, on a scale from  to , to .–. units lower astringency, up to . units lower off-flavours, and .–. units higher cocoa notes. Therefore, the anti-fungal co-culture B is recommended for future applications and its capacity to limit fungal growth and mycotoxin production during industrial-scale cocoa bean fermentation hould be investigated in further studies.","doc_id":3073,"prior":"health risk","SDG3":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23918","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Health of Swiss university students during the COVID-19 pandemic : impact and management","authors":"Dratva, Julia; Volken, Thomas; Zysset, Annina","subject":"Covid-19; Pandemic; Student; Depression; Anxiety; Risk behavior; Prevention; Social impact;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Persönliche Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"305, 613","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Health of Swiss university students during the COVID- pandemic : impact and management; Covid-; Pandemic; Student; Depression; Anxiety; Risk behavior; Prevention; Social impact;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Persönliche Gesundheit; The Corona pandemic is impacting all age groups and areas of society, irrespective of the risk of exposure or disease severity.

Inflammation is a prominent pathomechanism of CC. This small-scale study sets out to investigate the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide in inflammatory CC in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Methods: Patients with advanced solid malignancies, documented weight loss, no or unchanged anticancer treatment, and C-reactive protein> mg/L were included. In a :: randomization, patients received either lenalidomide mg once daily or C-reactive protein-guided dose, starting with  mg lenalidomide once daily or placebo once a day for  weeks. Dose adaption and safety were assessed twice a week. Treatment response was defined as an increase of lean body mass of more than % in a lower lumbar computed tomography and an increase in dynamometer-assessed handgrip strength of  kg. Secondary endpoints included adverse events, C-reactive protein response, nutritional intake, and symptoms.Results: Of  eligible patients,  were included (% female). At baseline, the mean age was  (range –) years, and mean body weight was . kg (range .–. kg). Five were diagnosed with mesothelioma, two with non-small-cell lung cancer, two with renal cell carcinoma, two with neuroendocrine tumours, and five with other malignancies. Mean survival was  days. Eleven adverse events (four of which were severe) were recorded with a probable link to study participation. Nine patients completed the study. No participant showed a treatment response. C-reactive protein-guided dosing did not result in lower doses of lenalidomide. Lean body mass decreased less in the treatment groups. For the lenalidomide and placebo groups respectively, handgrip strength decreased by . vs.. kg, nutritional intake decreased by  vs.  kcal/day, and C-reactive protein increased by  mg/dL vs. decreased by  mg/dL. The study was closed prematurely due to slow accrual and the need for concurrent anticancer treatments.Conclusions: No treatment response on muscle mass and muscle strength was observed with lenalidomide. Because of several limiting factors, including low recruitment caused in part by an ambitious study design and concomitant anti-cancer treatment, this study did not generate adequate data to draw reliable conclusions.","doc_id":3253,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3861","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Psychische Gesundheit in der Schweiz : Monitoring","authors":"Rüesch, Peter; Manzoni, Patrik","subject":"Epidemiologie; Monitoring; Psychische Gesundheit;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","type":"Buch","bid":"616.89","year":"2003","for_data_analysis":"Psychische Gesundheit in der Schweiz : Monitoring; Epidemiologie; Monitoring; Psychische Gesundheit;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","doc_id":3259,"prior":"Psychische Gesundheit","SDG3":1},{"id":"12","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1926","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Wie geht es eigentlich Ihnen? : Das Erleben von Eltern eines chronisch kranken Kindes im Spital","authors":"Füllemann, Claudia; Langenbach, Karin","subject":"Child; Hospitalized; Chronic Disease; Behavior; Attitude; Perception; Parents; Parental attitudes; Experience; Experiences;  Pädiatrie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"618.92","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Wie geht es eigentlich Ihnen? : Das Erleben von Eltern eines chronisch kranken Kindes im Spital; Child; Hospitalized; Chronic Disease; Behavior; Attitude; Perception; Parents; Parental attitudes; Experience; Experiences;  Pädiatrie; Hintergrund: Die Anzahl chronisch kranker Menschen nimmt stetig zu. % aller Todesfälle geht auf chronische Erkrankungen zurück.

This study explored HRQoL at  months postpartum in women with a history of one previous cesarean in three European countries.Methods: A prospective longitudinal survey, embedded within a cluster randomized trial in three countries, exploring women's postnatal HRQoL up to  months postpartum. The Short‐Form Six‐Dimensions (SF‐D) was used to measure HRQoL, and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship with mode of birth.Results: Complete data were available from  women. Women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had the highest HRQoL scores, whereas women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .) had the lowest. Postnatal readmission of the mother (P = .), having public health insurance (P = .), and a low antenatal HRQoL score (P < .) contributes to poorer HRQoL scores. More specifically, women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had significantly higher HRQoL scores on the vitality dimension compared with women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .).Conclusions: In women with low‐risk factors, repeat cesareans result in a poorer HRQoL compared with vaginal birth.

Five people with CP were included in the study. They participated in a single-life story interview coupled with timeline drawings. Data analysis was conducted using a narrative analysis.Results: The results revealed that occupational roles and the participation therein changed over time. Employee was considered the most important role, whereby the participants tried to maintain this role by sacrificing other roles within their lives.

The implemented system serves as an application example for Bluetooth Smart. It allows a user to monitor ongoing measurements of several data loggers through a smartphone. Additionally the recorded data of several loggers can be simultaneously uploaded to a central gateway. The available Bluetooth Smart chips and software stacks place limitations on usable bandwidth as well as on the number of simultaneous connections. Although most modern smartphones include hardware for Bluetooth Smart, implementations differ widely across platforms, thus creating additional effort for the app programmer.

However, up to % of blood relatives are unaware of relevant genetic information, suggesting that potential benefits of genetic testing are not communicated effectively within family networks. Technology can facilitate communication and genetic education within HBOC families.Objective: The aims of this study are to develop the K-CASCADE (Korean–Cancer Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) cohort in Korea by expanding an infrastructure developed by the CASCADE (Cancer Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) Consortium in Switzerland; develop a digital health intervention to support the communication of cancer predisposition for Swiss and Korean HBOC families, based on linguistic and cultural adaptation of the Family Gene Toolkit; evaluate its efficacy on primary (family communication of genetic results and cascade testing) and secondary (psychological distress, genetic literacy, active coping, and decision making) outcomes; and explore its translatability using the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework.Methods: The digital health intervention will be available in French, German, Italian, Korean, and English and can be accessed via the web, mobile phone, or tablet (ie, device-agnostic). K-CASCADE cohort of Korean HBOC mutation carriers and relatives will be based on the CASCADE infrastructure. Narrative data collected through individual interviews or mini focus groups from  to  HBOC family members per linguistic region and - health care providers involved in genetic services will identify the local cultures and context, and inform the content of the tailored messages. The efficacy of the digital health intervention against a comparison website will be assessed in a randomized trial with  HBOC mutation carriers ( in each study arm). The translatability of the digital health intervention will be assessed using survey data collected from HBOC families and health care providers.Results: Funding was received in October . It is projected that data collection will be completed by January  and results will be published in fall .Conclusions: This study addresses the continuum of translational research, from developing an international research infrastructure and adapting an existing digital health intervention to testing its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial and exploring its translatability using an established framework. Adapting existing interventions, rather than developing new ones, takes advantage of previous valid experiences without duplicating efforts. Culturally sensitive web-based interventions that enhance family communication and understanding of genetic cancer risk are timely. This collaboration creates a research infrastructure between Switzerland and Korea that can be scaled up to cover other hereditary cancer syndromes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT and CRiS KCT; https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): PRR-./","doc_id":3786,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2841","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Targeting antibiotic resistance","authors":"Chellat, Mathieu F.; Raguž, Luka; Riedl, Rainer","subject":"Medicinal chemistry; Antibiotic resistance; Drug design;  Chemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"540, 615","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Targeting antibiotic resistance; Medicinal chemistry; Antibiotic resistance; Drug design;  Chemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; Finding strategies against the development of antibiotic resistance is a major global challenge for the life sciences community and for public health.

As this is an important time window for child development, micronutrient fortified complementary feeding after  months of age, for example with milk or cereals products, in combination with continued breastfeeding, is recommended. The overall effect of this approach is unclear.Methods: We performed a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis to assess the impact of micronutrient fortified milk and cereal food on the health of infants and little children (aged  months to  years) compared to non-fortified food. We reviewed randomized controlled trials using electronic databases (MEDLINE and Cochrane library searches through FEB ), reference list screening and hand searches. Three reviewers assessed  studies for eligibility and extracted data. One reviewer assessed risk of bias using predefined forms.Results: We included  trials in our analysis (n = ’ children; range of mean hemoglobin values: . to . g/dl). Iron plus multi micronutrient fortification is more effective than single iron fortification for hematologic outcomes. Compared to non-fortified food, iron multi micronutrient fortification increases hemoglobin levels by . g/dl (%-CI: . to .;  studies) and reduces risk of anemia by % (relative risk .; %-CI . to .; absolute risk reduction %; number needed to treat  [%-CI:  to ];  Studies). Compared to non-fortified food, fortification increases serum levels of vitamin A but not of zinc. Information about functional health outcomes (e.g. weight gain) and morbidity was scarce and evidence is inconclusive. Risk of bias is unclear due to underreporting, but high quality studies lead to similar results in a sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Multi micronutrient fortified milk and cereal products can be an effective option to reduce anemia of children up to three years of age in developing countries. On the basis of our data the evidence for functional health outcomes is still inconclusive.","doc_id":3817,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2049","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Über Gewicht im Alter : Lebensqualität, Langlebigkeit und kulturelle Normen","authors":"Brombach, Christine","subject":"Lebenserwartung; Übergewicht; Alter; Ernährungsverhalten;  Soziale Gruppen;  Diätetik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"305, 613.2","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Über Gewicht im Alter : Lebensqualität, Langlebigkeit und kulturelle Normen; Lebenserwartung; Übergewicht; Alter; Ernährungsverhalten;  Soziale Gruppen;  Diätetik; Vielerorts wird darüber publiziert, dass Europa und die Welt immer übergewichtiger werden.

Some of the countries have increased or plan to increase the eligibility age for old-age pension. In this context, we examine the association between the prolongation of working life and cognitive health in late-life based on data from Sweden, where retirement age is more flexible than in most other countries. The aim of our study is to analyze whether the level of job-related cognitive stimulation affects the association between retirement age and cognitive functioning in old age. Methods: We use a representative dataset from Sweden, linking survey data from the Level of Living Survey (LNU), the Swedish Panel Study of Living conditions of the Oldest Old (SWEOLD) and annual tax register data. Using a propensity score matching approach, we create a quasi-experimental study design comparing individuals who extend their working life beyond age  with those who retire earlier. In addition, we use ordered logistic regression analysis to examine the effect of working longer by occupational groups.Results: We observe that on average, individuals who retire at age  or later do not have a higher level of cognitive functioning around age  than those who retired earlier. We observe higher levels of cognitive functioning around age  for individuals who retire at age  or later as compared to those who retire earlier. In addition, our analysis shows that if we control only for socio-demographic and occupational characteristics, individuals who worked in more complex and non-manual occupations have a better cognitive functioning in old age. However, if we include leisure activities that individuals attend during their retirement into the analysis, the effect of occupational characteristics becomes less strong and loses statistical significance whereas the effect for leisure activities is significant.Conclusion: Using longitudinal data and a causal approach that allows for tapping into mechanisms underlying the association between retirement and cognition, our results suggest that engaging in stimulating activities contributes to the maintenance of cognitive abilities in old-age. This finding allows informing the policy debate about the transition from employment to retirement.","doc_id":3937,"prior":"life expectancy","SDG3":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1971","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Biochar-based life support loop (SpaceLooP)","authors":"Schönborn, Andreas; Bleuler, Mira","subject":"Space Life Support System; Biochar; Feces Urine recycling;  Ingenieurwesen;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"620, 630","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Biochar-based life support loop (SpaceLooP); An innovative concept for a lunar base, based on ecological engineering; Space Life Support System; Biochar; Feces Urine recycling;  Ingenieurwesen;  Landwirtschaft; In the present study a new concept for ecological life support systems based on complete oxygen, water and food recycling for a future moon base was developed.

Based on literature review and modelling of mass flows in the system, using a mass balancing approach, several benefits of the inclusion of pyrolysis into a life support system were identified. Pyrolysis ensures complete destruction of pathogens, fibers and organic micropollutants contained in feces that could be harmful for hydroponic food production and human health. Pyrolysis further is a treatment process that does not require oxygen (like incineration). The treatment of wastes can therefore be achieved even without consuming the oxygen required by the crew. Moreover, carbon, and nutrients can be stored in a sterile and stable char and reused when there is need. Difficulties in nutrient recycling from biochar and pH balances in the system were identified as threats to the system. Further research needs to confirm the feasibility of fecal biochar as a hydroponic substrate of fertilizer and its impact on pH balances.","doc_id":3951,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"39","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12097","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"TRP channels in brown and white adipogenesis from human progenitors : new therapeutic targets and the caveats associated with the common antibiotic, streptomycin","authors":"Goralczyk, Anna; van Vijven, Marc; Koch, Mathilde; Badowski, Cedric; Yassin, M.

PET, a common thermoplastic, is recycled in many countries via thermal, mechanical and chemical means. Recently, several enzymes have been identified capable of degrading this recalcitrant plastic, opening possibilities for the biological recycling of the omnipresent material. In this review, we analyze the current knowledge of enzymatic PET degradation and discuss advances in improving the involved enzymes via protein engineering.

War es noch vor ein, zwei Jahrzehnten «undenkbar», dass zwei lesbische Frauen eine Familie gründen, eine Frau mit einem körperlichen Handicap oder (kontrollierter) Substanzabhängigkeit Mutter wird, vielen «unfruchtbaren» Frauen durch medizinischen Fortschritt das «Muttersein» ermöglicht wird, so nimmt die Betreuung von diesen «vulnerablen» Schwangerschaften und Familien mittlerweile einen immer grösseren Stellenwert im Berufsalltag der Hebamme ein. Diese «besonderen Schwangerschaften und Familien» sind anders – anders als die Norm. Sie zeigen die Vielfalt von Menschen, Lebensentwürfen und Möglichkeiten auf. Die Wahrnehmung und Reflexion der eigenen Haltung gegenüber diesen Familien sind, neben dem notwendigen Fachwissen, Voraussetzung, um diese Familien als zukünftige Hebammen professionell, bedarfsorientiert und evidenzbasiert betreuen zu können. Für die Unterrichtseinheit «Besondere Schwangerschaften und Familien» im Bachelorstudiengang Hebamme wurde deshalb grosser Wert daraufgelegt, sowohl kognitive als auch affektive Lernziele zu formulieren. Einerseits war es wichtig, dass sich die Studierenden das nötige, grösstenteils nicht in der gängigen Hebammenliteratur vorhandene Fachwissen aneignen und interprofessionelle Unterstützungsangebote kennen, andererseits sollten sie im Unterricht auch die Möglichkeit erhalten, sich in die Situation dieser Familien hineinzuversetzen. Neben der Sensibilisierung für mögliche Herausforderungen und Schwierigkeiten dieser Familien ist ein grosser Schwerpunkt dieses Unterrichts die Reflexion der eigenen Haltung gegenüber diesen Familien. Obwohl eine Haltungsänderung bei den Studierenden kein primäres Unterrichtsziel ist, gaben  Prozent der Studierenden in der Evaluation an, dass es aufgrund des Unterrichts zu Haltungsänderungen gegenüber diesen Familien gekommen sei. Viele der Studierenden waren überrascht und teilweise auch erschrocken über ihre unbewussten Vorurteile. Dieser Unterricht fördert durch eine Vielfalt von Lehr- und Lernmethoden in unterschiedlichen Sozialformen die selbstständige Aneignung von Fachwissen, die Auseinandersetzung mit der eigenen Sozialkompetenz, das kritische Hinterfragen der eigenen Haltung gegenüber diesen Familien und eine reflektierende «Praxis» als Grundvoraussetzung für eine professionelle «Praxis».","doc_id":4043,"prior":"Substanzabhängigkeit","SDG3":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21088","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"The importance of sweet beverage definitions when targeting health policies : the case of Switzerland","authors":"Sousa, Angelica; Sych, Janice Marie; Rohrmann, Sabine; Faeh, David","subject":"100% juice; Switzerland; Health policies sociodemographic characteristics; Low-calorie sweet beverage; Plant-based milk substitute; Soft drink; Sugar sweetened beverage; Sweet beverage;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362, 614","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"The importance of sweet beverage definitions when targeting health policies : the case of Switzerland; % juice; Switzerland; Health policies sociodemographic characteristics; Low-calorie sweet beverage; Plant-based milk substitute; Soft drink; Sugar sweetened beverage; Sweet beverage;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; Since high-sweet beverage intake is associated with health risks, defining what this term encompasses is relevant to the strategies confronting this problem. This study assessed both the sociodemographic factors associated with sweet beverage consumption in Switzerland and the amount consumed. According to the current definition in Switzerland (SB-CUR), sweet beverages include soft drinks, juices with added-sugar, and low-calorie sweet beverages. Using this definition and the representative menuCH survey (n = ; ages -), the average daily sweet beverage intake was determined and compared with a new sweet beverage definition (SB-NEW), which included all beverages with free sugars and low-calorie sweeteners. A generalized linear model was used to investigate correlates of sweet beverage consumption. Sweet beverage consumption under the SB-CUR and SB-NEW definition was . g/day and . g/day, respectively, with % juice consumption accounting for % of the difference. Carbonated drinks (sodas), low-calorie sweet beverages, and % juices were the highest contributors, each around  g/day. SB-NEW intake was higher in individuals who were male, young adults (aged -), from German-speaking regions, obese, or had a lower level of education.

The Mother-Generated Index (MGI) assesses postnatal QoL without providing a predefined checklist of questions. Mothers indicate areas of life affected by having a baby. Previous study did not consider the changes during the first weeks postpartum. Hence our study investigated: a) details and particularities of the areas of life affected after childbirth and thus to identify specific domains defining postnatal QoL; and b) differences in the relevance of these domains between weeks one and seven postpartum.Methods: Two-stage survey at three days ( participants) and seven weeks ( participants) after birth. We applied a qualitative content analysis of MGI data deductively and inductively build categories. Two raters independently coded with % of agreement. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Frequencies of the responses, the diversity of mentioned aspects and their specificity for the life situation of women during the postpartum period were used for the interpretation of the relevance of categories and subcategories.Preliminary results: Thirteen main domains defining postnatal QoL were identified, each with several subdomains: ‘physical wellbeing’ (e.g. fatigue, body consciousness), ‘psychological wellbeing’ (e.g. happiness, emotional confusion), ‘general wellbeing’ (not specified), motherhood (e.g. love and bonding to the baby, experience of giving birth, maternal feelings, breastfeeding), ‘family and partnership’ (e.g. responsibility for family, time for partner and other children), ‘social life’ (e.g. friends, being isolated), ‘everyday life’ (e.g. organisation daily routine, housework), ‘leisure’ (e.g. less time), ‘work life’ (e.g. worries about job), ‘financial issues’ (e.g. less money), ‘future’ (e.g. meaning in life), a ‘shift of priorities’ and a ‘changed role from being a working women’. The most frequently indicated and most specific domains at both stages were ‘family and partnership’ as well as ‘motherhood’. Working life was mentioned more often at three days than seven weeks postpartum. Social life in contrast, either positively or negatively affected, was noticed more often after seven weeks than after three days.Discussion: Women after childbirth identified a wide variety of areas of life affected by having a baby. Some mothers faced challenges to find their new role inside and outside their families and lacked of time for themselves, their leisure, the partner and the other children. Other women welcomed the slowdown of the life rhythm and experienced overwhelming maternal feelings.Conclusion: This study identified domains defining postnatal QoL which differed between weeks one and seven postpartum, suggesting that postnatal QoL is a concept that changes over time for new mothers by having a baby.Ethical matters: Ethical approval from Ethics Committee of Hannover Medical School (Nr. -).Funding source: Self-funded study.","doc_id":4146,"prior":"psychological wellbeing","SDG3":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4279","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Das Konzept der Handlung – wie wird es in der Praxis diskutiert? : Reflexion aus den Niederlanden und der Schweiz","authors":"Gantschnig, Brigitte; Kinébanian, Astrid","subject":"Occupation; Occupational therapy; Professionalisation;  Ergotherapie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615.8515","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"Das Konzept der Handlung – wie wird es in der Praxis diskutiert? : Reflexion aus den Niederlanden und der Schweiz; The concept of occupation – how is it discussed in practice? : reflections in the Netherlands and Switzerland; Occupation; Occupational therapy; Professionalisation;  Ergotherapie; Einleitung: Obwohl das Konzept der Handlung/Betätigung/Beschäftigung in der Literatur breit diskutiert und definiert wurde, findet das theoretische Wissen darüber nur langsam den Weg in die ergotherapeutische Praxis.

This has meant an upsurge in (a)synchronous online instruction, together with commensurate assessment methods. As the peri-COVID phases of translator education gradually transition to a post-COVID era, regulatory requirements, such as vaccination certification and infection testing, pressure on student numbers in increasingly competitive environments and changing student expectations about course delivery are driving institutions towards adopting hybrid forms of learning and teaching more permanently. Hastily implemented without the time or resources for prior validation, these differ substantially from best blended learning practices already established in translator education (Galán-Mañas & Hurtado Albir, ; Gerber et al., )- Hybridity presents programmes with particular challenges of resourcing and teacher training, and its effects on learning and teaching have been only sporadically reported (Massey, forthcoming/). This paper considers various hybrid approaches from the triple perspective of educators, students and their institutions, presenting case-study and self-report data from before and during the COVID- pandemic and also covering student expectations. We then outline the design and findings of studies launched to prepare for the late peri- and post-COVID phases of translator education. After discussing the benefits and caveats of the approaches taken, we outline a mode-switching model for translation teaching now entering the pilot stage. Finally, we reflect on how re-profiling delivery to accommodate certain hybrid solutions can add real didactic and organisational value to translator education curricula.ReferencesGalán-Mañas, A, & Hurtado Albir, A.

However, few studies included all DSM-IV PDs and even fewer adjusted for other forms of childhood adversity, e.g. bullying or family problems.Method: We analyzed questionnaires completed by  participants of the ZInEP epidemiology survey, a comprehensive psychiatric survey of the general population in Zurich, Switzerland. Associations between childhood adversity and PDs were analyzed bivariately via simple regression analyses and multivariately via multiple path analysis.Results: The bivariate analyses revealed that all PD dimensions were significantly related to various forms of family and school problems as well as child abuse. In contrast, according to the multivariate analysis only school problems and emotional abuse were associated with various PDs. Poverty was uniquely associated with schizotypal PD, conflicts with parents with obsessive-compulsive PD, physical abuse with antisocial PD, and physical neglect with narcissistic PD. Sexual abuse was statistically significantly associated with schizotypal and borderline PD, but corresponding effect sizes were small.Conclusion: Childhood adversity has a serious impact on PDs. Bullying and violence in schools and emotional abuse appear to be more salient markers of general personality pathology than other forms of childhood adversity. Associations with sexual abuse were negligible when adjusted for other forms of adversity.","doc_id":4469,"prior":"child abuse","SDG3":1},{"id":"8","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24369","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Impacts of Covid-19 on developing countries and the catch-up effect","authors":"van Vugt, Julia D.","subject":" Wirtschaft","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"330","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Impacts of Covid- on developing countries and the catch-up effect;  Wirtschaft; Since its emergence, COVID- has disrupted life globally. The World Bank, IMF, and OECD determined the pandemic to have had a severe impact on the world's economy in , even more so than the World Financial Crisis in . Whilst COVID- affected all countries, developing markets were especially vulnerable to the crisis due to their high employment rates in the informal sector and lower fiscal capabilities. Whilst forecasts for global economic growth in  are optimistic, the recovery will vary between the different regions and income levels.This thesis aimed to compare the impacts of the pandemic on the economies of developing and advanced countries. The paper focused on evaluating developing markets' future capabilities to converge their GDP per capita with developed countries through higher GDP growth rates. Therefore, economic growth was analysed per region and income level for , and forecasts for  until  were assessed. Additionally, the long-term impact of the decline of production factors in  and the importance of existing levels of production factors for future development were evaluated.The findings revealed that the pandemic severely impacted both advanced and emerging economies. However, the crisis affected future growth prospects to varying degrees in the different regions of the world. As advanced economies recover fast, convergence is deemed volatile until , and each region of emerging markets experiences divergent GDP per capita growth for at least one year. While Asian and European emerging markets display higher than average growth, Latin America can sustain growth rates similar to those in advanced economies. In contrast, the African countries and the Middle East struggle the most to reach high growth, mainly exhibiting divergent per capita growth rates in the future. Nonetheless, overcoming the effects of the pandemic is essential for all emerging markets, as a prolonged impact would considerably damage their convergence possibilities. Therefore, the rapid distribution of vaccines, leading to a faster reopening of the economies, is essential.The current forecast indicates that the decline in production factors during  has a limited impact on future GDP per capita growth. Combined with additional economic contributions provided by governments, this supports a positive outlook for the future. To continue achieving sustained growth, emerging economies need to focus on advancing their level of investment and on further improving and expanding access to education. Lastly, the institutions within emerging countries, such as the rule of law, need to be strengthened. All the mentioned factors have shown a significant relation with higher growth and were recommended policy measures to support development in emerging economies even before COVID-. However, since the pandemic is still ongoing, its impact should be re-evaluated continuously to derive the necessary policies to support the global economic recovery.","doc_id":4503,"prior":"vaccines","SDG3":1},{"id":"12","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21906","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"The burden of smoking in Switzerland : estimation for 2015 and prognosis until 2050","authors":"Mattli, Renato; Farcher, Renato; Dettling, Marcel; Syleouni, Maria-Eleni; Wieser, Simon","subject":" Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362.1041","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"The burden of smoking in Switzerland : estimation for  and prognosis until ;  Gesundheitsökonomie; Objective:To estimate the burden of smoking in Switzerland for  and predict smoking-related deaths until .Methods:Smoking attributable fractions (SAFs) are calculated based on the prevalence of smoking from the Swiss Health Survey and risk ratios extracted from literature.

Finally, the article suggests practical implications for the design and evaluation of future public health campaigns involving citizen co-creation.","doc_id":4655,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"85","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21631","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"How does sweetness taste? : an exploratory case study on the changeability of the sweet taste threshold in children in school setting","authors":"Keller, Daniela; Cezanne, Marie-Louise; Bongartz, Annette; Brombach, Christine","subject":"Sweet taste; Children; Threshold;  Psychologie;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"150, 664","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"How does sweetness taste? : an exploratory case study on the changeability of the sweet taste threshold in children in school setting; Sweet taste; Children; Threshold;  Psychologie;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; Overweight and obesity are a growing global concern in children, which might be linked to sweetness preference of children. While data on sweetness preference in children is available, little research has been done on sweet taste thresholds (STT). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the STT can be changed (reduced) in children and whether an implementation is feasible within school settings. In an explorative case study (n=), STT in children (- years) were determined in a school setting. As pre-test the taste thresholds of the children were captured, according to ISO standard , with  concentrations of . -  g sucrose/litre. The concentrations from - in ascending order were given to school children, no re-tasting was allowed. A -day sensitization phase served as an intervention, during which the children received an apple drink developed for this purpose for tasting on weekdays. The sugar concentration of the apple drink was reduced daily by % of the previous value. Finally, a second STT was carried out with the same children. Weight, height, origin, of children were not collected.A trend towards a reduction of the STT can be seen, yet it was statistically insignificant. The implementation of the sensitization in everyday school life has turned out to be positive. Organizational as well as methodical arrangements in school settings are feasible. A change (reduction) of STT tends to be possible. Interventions with elements of nutritional education are feasible in school settings and could be part of further research. Further studies are needed that consider the complexity of the change of STT with respect to the influence of intervention environments or duration.","doc_id":4667,"prior":"obesity","SDG3":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6049","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Psychische Gesundheit und Krankheit von Kindern und Jugendlichen in der Schweiz : Versorgung und Epidemiologie","authors":"von Wyl, Agnes; Chew Howard, Erica; Wade-Bohleber, Laura Maria; Haemmerle, Patrick","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"362, 616.89","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Psychische Gesundheit und Krankheit von Kindern und Jugendlichen in der Schweiz : Versorgung und Epidemiologie;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","doc_id":4712,"prior":"Psychische Gesundheit","SDG3":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12235","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Higher low back and neck pain in final year Swiss health professions’ students : worrying susceptibilities identified in a multi-centre comparison to the national population","authors":"Crawford, Rebecca J.; Volken, Thomas; Schaffert, René; Bucher, Thomas","subject":"Health profession; Low back pain; Neck pain; Self-reported health; Students; Swiss health survey; Switzerland;  Orthopädische Chirurgie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"617.5","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Higher low back and neck pain in final year Swiss health professions’ students : worrying susceptibilities identified in a multi-centre comparison to the national population; Health profession; Low back pain; Neck pain; Self-reported health; Students; Swiss health survey; Switzerland;  Orthopädische Chirurgie; Low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) are of considerable socio-economic burden.

KenmoS - KPI-Model for Non-medical Support Services in Hospitals. Version . – based on German original;  Facility Management; Since the introduction of the Diagnosis-related Group / SwissDRG, there has been a greatly increasing need for an improved data base and meaningful key figures [KPIs] for better steering and comparability in the non-medical support area [FM]. The aim was not only to compile a comprehensive compilation of KPIs in all facility management areas in the health care sector [FM in HC], but also to show connections between the required parameters. A comprehensive listing was made on the basis of existing FM and hospital key figure literature. In cooperation with four hospital partners and three business partners, the consortium research approach involved prioritizing and categorizing key figures in numerous expert rounds and interviews. The result is a catalogue of key figures which systematically lists KPIs suitable for FM in HC for each discipline, consolidates prioritised key figures and specifies them further for implementation. Thus, all the managers of FM in HC have the basis for their utililzation in practice. In doing so, they can access and discuss objective data in strategic discussions and decisions. The clear definition also makes it possible to compare with other hospitals in the future and thus to carry out benchmarking. The code catalogue KenkaS including the key figure model KenmoS is part of the reference model for non-medical support services in Hospitals RemoS and the basis for the guidance on the use of SAP for Facility Management in Healthcare LesapS together with the process model PromoS and the application catalogue ApplikaS and the assessment, simulation and benchmarking tool for facility management in health care.

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of two equipment versions of a telemedical device for pre-clinical traffic accident emergency rescues in Germany compared at baseline assumptions.\tMethods: Cost-effectiveness analysis with multi-way sensitivity-analysis is performed from a societal perspective. Costs resulting from personal injury, wasted journeys and erroneous dispatching of rescue services are based on data from the German Federal Highway Research Institute. The effects (life years gained) are based on probabilities for reducing therapy-free intervals and improvements in first-aid provided by laypersons derived from two logistic regression models, based on data from the GIDAS database.\tResults: The cost-effectiveness ratio of the version “Automatic Accident Alert” (, per life year gained) would be slightly higher than of the full equipment version (, per life year gained). Decreasing costs of devices would disproportionately reduce total costs and rapid market penetration would largely increase the cost-effectiveness ratio of both devices.\tConclusion: The net costs per life year gained in the application of the two versions of the telemedical device are very high. The implementation of the devices seems only realistic as part of a larger European co-ordinated initiative.","doc_id":4989,"prior":"traffic accident","SDG3":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1249","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Wohnen im Alter : Die Konsequenzen der demografischen Entwicklung auf den Immobilienmarkt","authors":"Greber, Julia","subject":" Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Wohnen im Alter : Die Konsequenzen der demografischen Entwicklung auf den Immobilienmarkt;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Die Schweiz sieht sich mit einer demografischen Wandelung konfrontiert. Dies einerseits durch die kontinuierliche Erhöhung der Lebenserwartung, andererseits durch den Rückgang der Geburtenziffern. Diese Veränderung wird fundamental von der Bevölkerungsalterung geprägt. Nicht nur Politik, Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft sind betroffen, sondern auch der Immobilienmarkt spürt die Konsequenzen der demografischen Entwicklung und wird vor rundum neue Herausforderungen gestellt. So ist nicht nur ein zunehmender Mangel an Wohnformen für die pensionierten Menschen zu beobachten; es haben sich mit dem Eintritt ins Pensionsalter auch deren Wohnbedürfnisse geändert.Da aufgrund der starken Zunahme älterer Menschen altersgerechtes Wohnen vermehrt an Bedeutung gewinnt, hat die vorliegende Arbeit zum Ziel, die veränderten Bedürfnisse der Pensionäre sowie die zukünftige Nachfrage nach Wohnimmobilien aufzuzeigen. Des Weiteren wird erörtert, wie die Wohnungswirtschaft auf die demografische Veränderung vorbereitet ist und wo Handlungsbedarf besteht.Zu diesem Zweck wurde mit Hilfe von Fachliteratur die grundlegenden Informationen zur Schweizer Bevölkerungsentwicklung sowie den diversen Wohnformen dargelegt. Es wurden zusätzlich zwei Fragebogen entwickelt, welche einerseits an Pensionierte im Bezirk Höfe, andererseits an zwei Experten des gleichen Bezirks gerichtet waren.Die Untersuchungen lassen erstens erkennen, dass sich der Grossteil der pensionierten Personen im Bezirk Höfe noch nicht mit dem Thema „Wohnen im Alter“ auseinandergesetzt hat, sich in ihrem Eigenheim sehr wohl fühlt und grosse Verwirrung zu den verschiedenen Wohnformen und deren Eigenschaften besteht. Aus den Befragungen zeigt sich zweitens, dass sich die Meinungen der Experten nicht in allen Punkten mit denjenigen der Pensionäre decken. Bei Expert  bestehen Diskrepanzen unter anderem bei den Punkten Kostengünstigkeit, Zentralität und Internetzugang. Expert  gewichtet das Bedürfnis einer hindernisfreien, zentralen und kostengünstigen Wohnung ungleich.Generell heisst Wohnen im Alter bei den befragten Pensionären „Wohnen in den eigenen vier Wänden“. Ein Umzug wird bei der Mehrheit nur als Notlösung in Erwägung gezogen. Obwohl diese Wohnmobilität bei den Befragten begrenzt ist, wäre es nicht richtig, dieses Verhalten auf die zukünftigen Pensionäre im Bezirk Höfe zu schliessen, da sich die Lebensformen ändern. Zudem gibt es oft keine den Wohnbedürfnissen entsprechenden Angebote, weshalb sie sich mit den aktuellen Wohnverhältnissen glücklich schätzen.Obschon heutzutage nur ein kleines Umzugspotenzial vorhanden ist, wird dieses in den kommenden Jahrzehnten anwachsen und muss mit einem entsprechenden Wohnangebot ausgeschöpft werden. Wichtig ist, dass ein Wohnkonzept erstellt wird, welches einen Mehrwert schafft und für die Pensionierten einen bedeutenden Vorteil mit sich bringt.","doc_id":4992,"prior":"Lebenserwartung","SDG3":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20656","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Suffizienz in der Ernährung : Typen sich suffizient ernährender Menschen","authors":"Lüchinger, Moritz","subject":"Suffizienz; Ernährung; Motivation; Werte; Nachhaltigkeit;  Diätetik","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"613.2","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Suffizienz in der Ernährung : Typen sich suffizient ernährender Menschen; Suffizienz; Ernährung; Motivation; Werte; Nachhaltigkeit;  Diätetik; Ergänzendes Material zum GAIA-Artikelmanuskript \"Verzicht mit Gewinn : eine Typologie sich suffizient ernährender Menschen\"; Suffizienz wird meistens als umfassendes Konzept betrachtet.

Während der Befragungen zeigte sich, dass eine zusätzliche, fünfte Rahmenbedingung für eine suffiziente Ernährungsweise zentral ist: die Einflüsse. Basierend auf diesen Rahmenbedingungen konnten aus den Interviews vier Typen sich suffizient ernährender Menschen abgeleitet werden: Die Nachhaltigen, die Gesunden, die Sportlichen und die Bewussten. Mit den erarbeiteten Rahmenbedingungen könnten weitere Typen sich suffizient ernährender Menschen identifiziert werden. So werden Handlungsmöglichkeiten in der suffizienten Ernährung aufgezeigt, die auch nicht aus nachhaltigen Gründen agierende Menschen ansprechen. Die Motivation, warum sich die in den Interviews Befragten suffizient ernähren, konnte dabei unterschiedlicher Natur sein und war nicht zwingend beim Wert Nachhaltigkeit zu finden. Einige gaben an, aus gesundheitlichen Gründen auf gewisse Produkte zu verzichten, andere zur körperlichen Leistungssteigerung und wieder andere aus religiösen Gründen. Die Mehrheit der Befragten erzählte, sich durch die Änderung des Ernährungsverhaltens gesünder und wohler zu fühlen.; Sufficiency is usually regarded as a general concept. It is a sustainability strategy determined by human behaviour. Self-imposed restrictions in various areas of life, such as mobility or consumption, reduce environmental impacts.The sub-aspect of diet has so far been largely neglected as a research subject in sufficiency research. The present study aims to counteract the negative connotation of sufficiency as a strategy of \"renunciation\" with regard to diet. Through the literature and the conduct of qualitative interviews, determinants were identified which can be considered as a framework for a sufficient diet. With the help of these determinants, different types of sufficient diet could be identified from the interviews. The work was based on the following research questions: ) What types of people who eat enough exist? ) For what reasons (motivation) do people decide to eat sufficient?It was shown that five factors are decisive for a sufficient diet. These factors are: the personal values of a person, his or her goals behind his or her actions, influences such as social environment or family, personal behaviour and the effects of this dietary behaviour on the individual and the environment. The four basic conditions values, goals, behaviour and effects were derived from the literature. During the interviews it became apparent that an additional, fifth framework condition is central to a sufficient diet: the influences. Based on these conditions, four types of people who eat sufficient could be derived from the interviews: the sustainable, the healthy, the athletic and the aware. With the framework conditions developed, further types of people who eat sufficient could be identified. This would make it possible to identify options for action in the area of sufficiency that would also appeal to people who do not act for sustainable reasons.The motivation why the interviewees eat sufficient could be of different nature and was not necessarily found in the value of sustainability. Some stated that they did not use certain products for health reasons, others to improve physical performance and still others for religious reasons. The majority of respondents said they felt healthier and more comfortable by changing their dietary habits.","doc_id":5095,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23343","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Generalized anxiety among Swiss health professions and non-health professions students : an open cohort study over 14 months in the COVID-19 pandemic","authors":"Volken, Thomas; Zysset, Annina; Amendola, Simone; von Wyl, Agnes; Dratva, Julia","subject":"Generalized anxiety disorder; Health profession; Student; COVID-19; Mental health; Young adult;  Persönliche Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Generalized anxiety among Swiss health professions and non-health professions students : an open cohort study over  months in the COVID- pandemic; Generalized anxiety disorder; Health profession; Student; COVID-; Mental health; Young adult;  Persönliche Gesundheit; To date, little is known about the long-term trajectory of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms in health professions (HP) students over the course of the pandemic. Like health professionals in general, HP students may have a significantly greater susceptibility to GAD symptoms due to their involvement in the health care system and the associated specific stressors and risks during the COVID- pandemic. The HEalth in Students during the Corona pandemic study (HES-C) provided the opportunity to investigate the long-term course of GAD symptoms with eight measurement points over  months in  HP and non-HP students in Switzerland between March  and June . We employed logistic regression models with clustered sandwich standard errors to estimate unadjusted and adjusted prevalence of GAD symptoms. In the full model, we adjusted for age, gender, nationality, social status, social support, self-efficacy, and COVID- symptoms in the past  weeks. At baseline, the estimated adjusted GAD symptom prevalence was .% (% CI = .–.) in HP students and .% (% CI = .–.) in their peers. With the peak of the second SARS-CoV- infection wave in October/November , GAD symptom prevalence substantially increased and then remained stable over time, despite changes in the epidemiological situation and its associated containment measures. At the last follow-up in June , GAD symptom prevalence in HP and non-HP students was .% (% CI = .–.) and .% (% CI = .–.), respectively. Absolute differences in GAD symptom prevalence between student groups over all eight measurement points ranged from .% to .% (all p < .). Non-HP students are identified as a specifically vulnerable group. Accordingly, target group-specific public health campaigns and interventions should be developed with the aim to strengthen their resources, reducing GAD symptoms, and preventing chronification.","doc_id":5118,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"66","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22627","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Beyond microsatellite instability : intrinsic disorder as a potential link between protein short tandem repeats and cancer","authors":"Verbiest, Max; Delucchi, Matteo; Bilgin Sonay, Tugce; Anisimova, Maria","subject":"Short tandem repeats; Microsatellites; Microsatellite instability; Intrinsic disorder; Cancer; Computational biology; Protein bioinformatics;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Beyond microsatellite instability : intrinsic disorder as a potential link between protein short tandem repeats and cancer; Short tandem repeats; Microsatellites; Microsatellite instability; Intrinsic disorder; Cancer; Computational biology; Protein bioinformatics;  Biochemie; Short tandem repeats (STRs) are abundant in genomic sequences and are known for comparatively high mutation rates; STRs therefore are thought to be a potent source of genetic diversity.

Results: Pediatricians reported the exchange with parents and children as well as the suffering of the children to be central when selecting a therapy. On average, they arrange three meetings with parents, of which two take place with the concerned child.  They also report including information from several sources before arriving at a diagnosis. Pharmacological therapy was most frequent, followed by psychotherapy, and occupational therapy. Challenges mentioned were: the subjective character of the diagnosis and frequent co-morbidities, limited resources for case management, limited availability of child and youth psychiatry and psychotherapy, and unfavorable public attitudes toward medication. Conclusions: Pediatricians do consider a multimodal approach when treating ADHD and show a high involvement of family and child in the choice of therapy. However, they highlight the potential of improving the cooperation with other specialists, such as teachers and school social workers, and of improving the availability of psychotherapy and information on ADHD.","doc_id":5395,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5532","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Legionella in FM : Detection of Legionella pneumophila in waterlines of dental surgeries in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland","authors":"Leiblein, Thomas; Kroslakova, Ivana; Freimüller Leischtfeld, Susette; Fieseler, Lars; Hofer, Susanne","subject":"Legionella;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Facility Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"610, 658.2","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Legionella in FM : Detection of Legionella pneumophila in waterlines of dental surgeries in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland; Legionella;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Facility Management; Facility management (FM) is present in healthcare.

Food value chains, both primary production and downstream processing, have been identified as one of the priority areas to reduce environmental impacts of food production. The implementation of clean technologies, which are customised to South African food value chains and help to mitigate these impacts, are therefore crucial.Goal and Scope: In order to make science-based decisions about the implementation of clean technologies, the project “Applying Life Cycle Assessment for the mitigation of environmental impacts of South African agri-food products” aimed at quantifying environmental mitigation potentials when applying clean technologies. The environmental impact of technologies currently applied at South African dairy and arable farms was analysed for environmental hotspots. Based on this data, the effect of applying the following mitigation options were analysed: () Milk production: Adding the methane inhibitor -nitrooxypropanol (NOP) to the feed of lactating Holstein cows. () Maize production I: The use of variable frequency drive in centre-pivot irrigation of maize. () Maize production II: Provision of electricity for pumping irrigation water directly by solar panels.The following nine environmental impact categories were analysed: global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (non-renewable: fossil and nuclear), eutrophication (freshwater and marine), human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer effects), freshwater ecotoxicity and land use.Results: Firstly, adding NOP to the feed of cows decreases the GWP of milk at farm by  %, without changing the impact in other categories. Secondly, integrating a variable frequency drive for the irrigation of maize decreases the impact of maize in six of the considered impact categories by  % to  %, while in three categories, there is no substantial change. Finally, powering maize irrigation with photovoltaic solar panels, a decrease from  % to  % can be expected in five categories, whereas no negative effects arise in the other categories.Interpretation and Conclusion: The administration of NOP to cows only decreases the environmental impact in one impact category (GWP). The expected reductions take into account the direct emissions of cows but not potential additional emissions from the manure. Further long-term tests are recommended before a wide implementation should be considered. The integration of the variable speed drive is simple and does not only have environmental benefits, but additionally leads to economic advantages and is therefore a promising option. There are clear environmental advantages of irrigation powered by solar panels. The implementation of this clean technology is feasible, since the installation of the panels is simple and low-priced and because the panels require only little maintenance. In addition, only a very small percentage of the irrigated area (. %) is needed for the installation of the panels.Thus, all three cleantech options are promising and can generally be recommended, but for the adding of  NOP to the feed of cows, additional aspects need to be resolved before implementation.","doc_id":5641,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24663","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"The strategic use of microlearning as a training approach for the purpose of workforce skills development in multinational corporations","authors":"Loh Joey, Krystal","subject":" Personalmanagement","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"658.3","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The strategic use of microlearning as a training approach for the purpose of workforce skills development in multinational corporations;  Personalmanagement; The rapid pace of digital disruption aggravated by socio-demographic trends have impacted the nature of work tremendously. The skills that multinational corporations (MNCs) value and relied upon have been evolving faster than ever. Hence, learning and development (L&D) has been finding new ways to help their workforce keep up with the shifting skills needs. However, there have been numerous issues with traditional training for skills development, including considerable financial and time investments that may interfere with a company's daily operations. As a result, an increasing trend toward technology-enabled learning, such as microlearning, has aided MNCs in quickly filling skill gaps. The aim of this thesis was to shed light on the emerging topic of microlearning in hopes of paving the way for future research. With many L&D professionals still unfamiliar with the present state of microlearning, they would have been even far less aware of the factors to implement it successfully within their organizations. This research also took on the strategic lens in examining the role of strategic human resource management (SHRM) and organizational learning (OL) through the perspective of L&D professionals. Four research objectives have also been of particular interest throughout this thesis. In order to fulfill the research question and stated objectives, this research adopted a qualitative research design of an exploratory nature. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six L&D professionals. There were two categories of L&D experts interviewed: those with strategic level experience and those with systems or operational level expertise. The results showed that L&D professionals agreed that SHRM and OL serve as a sources of competitive advantage. The conducted research also revealed that OL is not only a competitive advantage, but also a survival strategy, as it aids the firm in adapting to its ever-changing business environment. The findings also indicated that L&D is seen as a strategic enabler. The results gathered that the most critical skills gap is the need to enable employees to take care of their continuous self-development. By combining the information from the literature review with the findings from the interviews, five main drivers for the adoption of microlearning emerged. Likewise, this thesis also presented five main features that distinguish microlearning as an effective training approach for skills development. Taking into account the study's limitations, the findings led to recommendations for L&D professionals on nine multi-dimensional success factors for the implementation of microlearning. While L&D has a crucial role to play in the success of an organization’s training strategy and approach, it also demands significant buy-in and participation from top management, line management, and every single employee. Ultimately, every single learner should be responsible for his or her continuous self-development in order for the organization to gain a competitive advantage through its human capital.","doc_id":5644,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12551","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Care needs of elderly cancer patients and their caregivers","authors":"Stolz Baskett, Petra; Imhof, Lorenz; Ream, E.","subject":"Patient; Elderly; Nursing; Cancer;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Care needs of elderly cancer patients and their caregivers; Patient; Elderly; Nursing; Cancer;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":5659,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"69","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16123","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Perinatal mental disorders in Switzerland : prevalence estimates and use of mental-health services","authors":"Berger, Anke; Bachmann, Nicole; Signorell, Andri; Erdin, Rebekka; Oelhafen, Stephan; Reich, Oliver; Cignacco, Eva","subject":"Health care cost; Insurance claim review; Mental disorder; Mental health service; Midwifery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Referral and consultation; Postpartum period;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Perinatal mental disorders in Switzerland : prevalence estimates and use of mental-health services; Health care cost; Insurance claim review; Mental disorder; Mental health service; Midwifery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Referral and consultation; Postpartum period;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: Perinatal mental disorders (PMDs) are the most common complication of pregnancy and the first postpartum year. Since PMD prevalence and use of mental-health services by perinatal women in Switzerland are unknown, we analysed existing health statistics.Methods: We used statistics from a large health insurance company, hospitals and freelance midwives. We assessed the annual rates of mental healthcare use in perinatal women (n =  ). We ascertained the annual rates of PMD treatment in obstetric inpatients (n =  ), and annual rates of PMD records by freelance midwives (n =  ). In   women who gave birth in  or , we assessed use of mental-healthcare before and during pregnancy, and in the postpartum year. For the same sample, we determined proportions of medication and consultation treatments. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate the influence of PMD on overall healthcare costs of mandatory health insurance.Results: The annual rate of mental-healthcare use by perinatal women was .%. The annual rate of PMD treatment in obstetric inpatients was .%. The annual rate of PMD records in the midwifery care setting was .%. Women with PMD use mental health services mainly in non-obstetric outpatient settings. Medication was the most frequent treatment. Primary care providers and mental health specialists contributed almost equally to consultation treatments. PMD during pregnancy raised overall costs of healthcare in the postpartum year by  Swiss francs.Conclusions: Health-system research and perinatal healthcare should take into consideration the high prevalence of PMD. Real PMD prevalence may be even higher than our data suggest and could be assessed with a survey using our model of PMD prevalence.","doc_id":5697,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21442","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"The COVID-19 social monitor longitudinal online panel : real-time monitoring of social and public health consequences of the COVID-19 emergency in Switzerland","authors":"Moser, André; Carlander, Maria; Wieser, Simon; Hämmig, Oliver; Puhan, Milo A.; Höglinger, Marc","subject":"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus infections; Female; Humans; Longitudinal studies; Male; Middle aged; Pandemics; Personal satisfaction; Pneumonia, viral; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2; Self report; Surveys and questionnaires; Switzerland; Young adult; Health behavior; Public health; Social behavior;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"The COVID- social monitor longitudinal online panel : real-time monitoring of social and public health consequences of the COVID- emergency in Switzerland; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-; Coronavirus infections; Female; Humans; Longitudinal studies; Male; Middle aged; Pandemics; Personal satisfaction; Pneumonia, viral; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-; Self report; Surveys and questionnaires; Switzerland; Young adult; Health behavior; Public health; Social behavior;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; The COVID- pandemic challenges societies in unknown ways, and individuals experience a substantial change in their daily lives and activities.

This development questions the sustainability of health plans that feature strong cross-subsidization across different health risk types and health behaviors. An important observation is that the willingness to cross-subsidize risks in health plans might depend on whether the risk is uncontrollable by individuals, such as genetic risk, or modifiable via health behaviors. This paper provides the results of an experiment on the willingness to pool genetic risk in health insurance. Subjects' overall health risk has an assigned, uncontrollable genetic risk part that differs across individuals as well as a behavioral risk part, which can be reduced by costly effort. Participants can decide between a pooling, community-rated group insurance scheme and an insurance with a fully individually risk-adjusted premium. In the experimental variation, the group insurance scheme either includes behavioral risk or separates it out via individual premium discounts. Although we observe social preferences for pooling, only a low level of actual genetic risk pooling emerges across the experimental conditions. This is due to both large heterogeneity in social preferences for pooling across subjects, and the dynamics of the willingness to pay for group insurance in the different experimental markets. Thus, our results indicate that mandatory pooling might be needed if, under the veil of ignorance, a society nevertheless wishes to pool certain forms of heterogeneous risk exposure, such as genetic risk.","doc_id":5741,"prior":"health risk","SDG3":1},{"id":"60","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21019","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Digital maternal health booklets : do they help reaching migrant populations","authors":"Zysset, Annina; Dratva, Julia","subject":" Medien;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"302.23, 610","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Digital maternal health booklets : do they help reaching migrant populations;  Medien;  Medizin und Gesundheit","doc_id":5778,"prior":"maternal health","SDG3":1},{"id":"77","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3150","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Intervertebral disc regeneration : small and large scale systems","authors":"Bono, Epifania; Mauth, Corinna; Franscini, Nicola; Durner, Roland; Boos, Norbert; Graf-Hausner, Ursula","subject":"Regeneration; Disc; Intervertebal;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"610","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Intervertebral disc regeneration : small and large scale systems; Regeneration; Disc; Intervertebal;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Objectives: The intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is an aberrant cell-mediated response to progressive structural failure.

These include different perspectives on the perception and evaluation of problem situations, different patterns of interpretation with regard to the validity of knowledge and procedures of problem solving (e.g. Stirling, p. ). In addition, there is a change in the framework conditions for doctor-patient communication, in particular due to the increase in the significance of digital communication environments (Hannawa & Rothenfluh; Altendorfer).The poster illuminates questions of public health prevention from the point of view and with the methods of linguistic, corpus-driven discourse analysis (Spitzmüller & Warnke; Bubenhofer b). It is based on two research projects commissioned by the Swiss health authorities which were carried out between  and  and were based on an extensive digital text corpus (Stücheli-Herlach et al., pp. -). The focus was on the question of the linguistically formed \"common sense\" on the subject of antibiotic resistance. In public dis-courses the research team examined manifest controversies (e.g. Dascal) as well as possible discourse coalitions among relevant actors of health communication (e.g. Hajer) on the basis of significant recursive patterns of language use (Bubenhofer a).Specifically, the \"Strategy Antibiotic Resistance StAR\" of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) was discussed. The research team examined corresponding antibiotic and antibiotic resistance discourses in German and French, using a German-language corpus of  web sources with . million individual texts and  million words as well as a French-language corpus of  web sources with , individual texts and . million words.

However, among persons with AD a lower proportion of perceived access to the technology was described, as well as for persons with MCI.Conclusion: To make the benefits of e-health services available and used by all clients, it is important to consider access to the technology required in e-health services and also to support the clients’ capabilities to understand and use the technologies. Also, the potential use of the ETUQ to explore the perceived access to and competence in using e-health technologies is a vital issue in the use of e-health services.","doc_id":5996,"prior":"Krankheiten","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8411","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Using a screening tool to evaluate potential use of e-health services for older people with and without cognitive impairment","authors":"Malinowsky, Camilla; Nygård, Louise; Kottorp, Anders","subject":"Telemedicine;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362, 616.8","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Using a screening tool to evaluate potential use of e-health services for older people with and without cognitive impairment; Telemedicine;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Objectives: E-health services are increasingly offered to provide clients with information and a link to healthcare services.

We developed and evaluated a short fear of birth scale that incorporates the most common dimensions of fear reported by men and women prior to pregnancy, fear of: labour pain, being out of control and unable to cope with labour and birth, complications, and irreversible physical damage.Methods: University students in six countries (Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Iceland, and the United States, n = ) participated in an online survey to assess their fears and attitudes about birth. We report internal consistency reliability, corrected-item-to-total correlations, factor loadings and convergent and discriminant validity of the new scale.Results: The Childbirth Fear – Prior to Pregnancy (CFPP) scale showed high internal consistency across samples (α > .). All corrected-item-to total correlations exceeded ., supporting the uni-dimensionality of the scale. Construct validity of the CFPP was supported by a high correlation between the new scale and a two-item visual analogue scale that measures fear of birth (r > . across samples). Weak correlations of the CFPP with scores on measures that assess related psychological states (anxiety, depression and stress) support the discriminant validity of the scale.","doc_id":6043,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10797","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"ZHAW Waedenswil : a new approach in the fight against cancer","authors":"Rimann, Markus","subject":"Alginate; Antineoplastic agent; Biological assay; Biomedical research; Biomedical technology; Glucuronic acid; Hexuronic acid; Human; Lung neoplasm; Mesothelioma; Tumor cell, cultured; Cell culture technique;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"ZHAW Waedenswil : a new approach in the fight against cancer; Alginate; Antineoplastic agent; Biological assay; Biomedical research; Biomedical technology; Glucuronic acid; Hexuronic acid; Human; Lung neoplasm; Mesothelioma; Tumor cell, cultured; Cell culture technique;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; A happy coincidence brought Dr Markus Rimann from ZHAW Wädenswil together with Dr Andreas Meyer from the start-up FGen and PD Dr Emanuela Felley-Bosco, Molecular Oncologist at Zurich University Hospital, to develop a technology platform for the manufacture and high throughput analysis of single mesothelioma spheroids.

The aim of this study was thus to describe this group of noncompliant people.Methods: A random sample of , people was drawn from the adult general population of Switzerland based on a three-stepped quota scheme considering the variables age (–, –, –, and ≥ years), sex (male and female), and language region (German-, French-, and Italian-speaking Switzerland). We assessed a global scale of non-compliance with NPI based on several individual measures such as wearing face masks and social distancing. As predictor variables we included objective sociodemographic variables (e.g., age, sex) and easy measurable constructs (e.g., fears and worries about COVID-, trust in medical experts).Results: Out of  predictor variables tested, seven were statistically significantly associated with increased non-compliance with NPI: male sex, younger age, self-identification as low-risk group, judging the consequences of an infection with SARS-CoV- as non-serious, less worries and fears about the pandemic, not obtaining regular information from health authorities, and not trusting in medical experts. The most parsimonious multivariable prediction model included the variables younger age, low appraisal of negative consequences, less fear and worries, not obtaining regular information from health authorities, and not trusting in medical experts. The model accounted for .% of variance explained in non-compliance with NPI.Conclusion: Young adults who perceive COVID- as mostly harmless/inconsequential and who ignore and/or mistrust information from health authorities and medical experts, are the population most likely to be noncompliant with NPI. These findings may help to target a group of people at high risk of infection and to efficiently concentrate educational and interventional public health measures.","doc_id":6059,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22064","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Disposable bioreactors","authors":"Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Eibl, Dieter","subject":"Biochemistry; Bioreactor; Biotechnology; Downstream Processing; Pharmaceuticals; Therapeutics; Tissue Engineering; Transport;  Technische Chemie","type":"Buch","bid":"660","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Disposable bioreactors; Biochemistry; Bioreactor; Biotechnology; Downstream Processing; Pharmaceuticals; Therapeutics; Tissue Engineering; Transport;  Technische Chemie; Over the past five years, the immense financial pressure on the development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals has resulted in the increasing use and acce- ance of disposables, which are discarded after harvest and therefore intended only for single use. In fact, such disposables are implemented in all the main bioprocess production stages today and an even higher growth than those in the biopharmac- tical market is predicted (reaching double figures). Alongside disposable filter capsules, membrane chromatography units, tubing, connectors, flexible containers processing or containing fluids, freezer systems, mixers and pumps, and fully c- trolled disposable bioreactors of up to , L culture volume are already available on the market. Numerous studies highlight the advantages of disposable bioreactors and reveal their potential for simple, safe and fast seed inoculum production, process devel- ment and small as well as middle volume production (e.g. bioactive substances, viruses for vaccines and gene therapies etc.). They suggest that such disposable bioreactors (typically characterized by the cultivation chamber or bag from plastic materials) may be advantageous for plant, animal and microbial cells. Running industrial activities such as CFD-modelling, development of single-use process monitoring and control technology, and standardized film formulations are attempting to resolve the limitations of the current disposable bioreactors. These achievements, along with substantial improvements in product yield, will reduce the use of stainless steel in the biomanufacturing facilities of the future.","doc_id":6079,"prior":"vaccines","SDG3":1},{"id":"84","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20758","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Life-Coaching für private Lebensthemen : Theoriebasiertheit und Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit","authors":"Grosheva, Sonja","subject":"Life-Coaching; Evidenzbasierte Praxis; Professionalisierung; Psychische Gesundheit; Lebensqualität; Psychologische Theorien; Lerntheorie;  Angewandte Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"158","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Life-Coaching für private Lebensthemen : Theoriebasiertheit und Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit; Life-Coaching; Evidenzbasierte Praxis; Professionalisierung; Psychische Gesundheit; Lebensqualität; Psychologische Theorien; Lerntheorie;  Angewandte Psychologie; Hintergrund:Life-Coaching ist ein ungeschützter Beruf, der aufgrund der Leistungs- und Selbstoptimierungsgesellschaft an Popularität gewinnt.

Die mangelnde Repräsentativität von HCD hängt damit zusammen, dass zurzeit nur ein kleiner Teil der Spitex-Organisationen Daten an HCD liefert. Gründe dafür sehen die Expertinnen und Experten hauptsächlich darin, dass in vielen Organisationen der Nutzen des HCD zu wenig erkannt wird, was die Motivation zur Datenlieferung reduziert. Als problematisch wird zudem die Zuverlässigkeit der Datenerhebung betrachtet. Gemäss den Befragten ist bspw. zu wenig klar, nach welchen Kriterien die verschiedenen Instrumente des Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) in den Spitex-Organisationen eingesetzt werden. Deshalb wird empfohlen, bereits bestehende Prozesse zu stärken und eine nachhaltige Struktur zur Unterstützung von Spitex-Organisationen zu entwickeln, um eine höhere Teilnahme und Datenqualität zu erreichen. Im Rahmen dieser Struktur könnten Organisationen sowohl in der korrekten RAI-HC Anwendung und Standardisierung wie auch in der Nutzung von HCD und Qualitätsindikatoren kontinuierlich begleitet werden.(B) Erweiterung der Datengrundlagen zum Spitex Bereich: Die interviewten Expertinnen und Experten erachten eine Erweiterung von HCD mit Informationen aus anderen Datensätzen als wünschenswert. Weitere Ansatzpunkte zur Verbesserung der Datenlage finden sich deshalb in der Verknüpfung von HCD zu verschiedenen anderen bestehenden Daten und in der Entwicklung neuer anschlussfähiger Instrumente. Bezüglich einer Verknüpfung bietet sich inhaltlich die Spitex-Statistik an. Hier zeigt sich aber ein Problem der Verknüpfungen. Da die Spitex-Statistik gemäss den Expertinnen und Experten in ihrer aktuellen Struktur zu wenig granular ist, müssten auch diese Daten auf Ebene der Klientinnen und Klienten erheben. Bezüglich der Entwicklung neuer Instrumente sollte u.a. die Möglichkeiten der Integration von Daten zur Zufriedenheit und den Erfahrungen der Klientinnen und Klienten weiterverfolgt werden, wie dies mit dem PREM (Patient-reported experience measure) «Client Satisfaction Instrument – Home Care» in einer Teilstudie dieses Projektes vorbereitet wurde. In weiterführenden Projekten könnte dieses auf Klienten-Erfahrungen basierende Messinstrument dann auch mit PROMs (Patient-reported outcome measures) weiterentwickelt werden.(C) Ressourcen zur Weiterentwicklung von HCD mit Fokus auf die Datenverwendung: In den Interviews hat sich gezeigt, dass verschiedene Nutzungsgruppen darauf angewiesen sind, dass HCD Daten in Form von Auswertungen in Berichten zugänglich gemacht werden, und dass gleichzeitig HCD noch wenig bekannt ist. Deshalb wird empfohlen, HCD mittels der Bereitstellung von Ressourcen für ) Datenauswertungen und Berichte und ) Vermittlung des Nutzens breiter bekannt zu machen. Diese Ressourcen können innerhalb vorhandener Strukturen aber auch in Neuen und mit zusätzlichen Stakeholdern etabliert werden. Alle drei Empfehlungen wurden von  antwortenden Stakeholdern in einer Befragung zu diesem Bericht als relevant eingestuft. Die Online-Befragung diente dem Einholen einer Resonanz zum Bericht und den Empfehlungen.

Im Rahmen dieser Struktur könnten Organisationen sowohl in der korrekten RAI-HC Anwendung und Standardisierung wie auch in der Nutzung von HCD und Qualitätsindikatoren kontinuierlich begleitet werden.(B) Erweiterung der Datengrundlagen zum Spitex Bereich: Die interviewten Expertinnen und Experten erachten eine Erweiterung von HCD mit Informationen aus anderen Datensätzen als wünschenswert. Weitere Ansatzpunkte zur Verbesserung der Datenlage finden sich deshalb in der Verknüpfung von HCD zu verschiedenen anderen bestehenden Daten und in der Entwicklung neuer anschlussfähiger Instrumente. Bezüglich einer Verknüpfung bietet sich inhaltlich die Spitex-Statistik an. Hier zeigt sich aber ein Problem der Verknüpfungen. Da die Spitex-Statistik gemäss den Expertinnen und Experten in ihrer aktuellen Struktur zu wenig granular ist, müssten auch diese Daten auf Ebene der Klientinnen und Klienten erheben. Bezüglich der Entwicklung neuer Instrumente sollte u.a. die Möglichkeiten der Integration von Daten zur Zufriedenheit und den Erfahrungen der Klientinnen und Klienten weiterverfolgt werden, wie dies mit dem PREM (Patient-reported experience measure) «Client Satisfaction Instrument – Home Care» in einer Teilstudie dieses Projektes vorbereitet wurde. In weiterführenden Projekten könnte dieses auf Klienten-Erfahrungen basierende Messinstrument dann auch mit PROMs (Patient-reported outcome measures) weiterentwickelt werden.(C) Ressourcen zur Weiterentwicklung von HCD mit Fokus auf die Datenverwendung: In den Interviews hat sich gezeigt, dass verschiedene Nutzungsgruppen darauf angewiesen sind, dass HCD Daten in Form von Auswertungen in Berichten zugänglich gemacht werden, und dass gleichzeitig HCD noch wenig bekannt ist. Deshalb wird empfohlen, HCD mittels der Bereitstellung von Ressourcen für ) Datenauswertungen und Berichte und ) Vermittlung des Nutzens breiter bekannt zu machen. Diese Ressourcen können innerhalb vorhandener Strukturen aber auch in Neuen und mit zusätzlichen Stakeholdern etabliert werden. Alle drei Empfehlungen wurden von  antwortenden Stakeholdern in einer Befragung zu diesem Bericht als relevant eingestuft. Die Online-Befragung diente dem Einholen einer Resonanz zum Bericht und den Empfehlungen. Die höchste Relevanz wurde der Verbesserung der Qualität und Repräsentativität der HCD Daten beigemessen.","doc_id":6162,"prior":"Gesundheitswesen","posterior":"zugänglich","SDG3":1},{"id":"10","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22490","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Translating into Easy Italian : an analysis of health-related texts and their impact on comprehension by people with intellectual disabilities","authors":"Carrer, Luisa","subject":"Easy-to-read language; Easy Italian; Intellectual disability; Functional illiteracy; Leichte Sprache Italienisch;  Barrierefreie Kommunikation;  Translationswissenschaft","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"418.0087, 418.02","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Translating into Easy Italian : an analysis of health-related texts and their impact on comprehension by people with intellectual disabilities; Easy-to-read language; Easy Italian; Intellectual disability; Functional illiteracy; Leichte Sprache Italienisch;  Barrierefreie Kommunikation;  Translationswissenschaft; Recent studies show that low literacy affects large segments of the adult population, both in Switzerland and Italy.

Yet, there is a paucity of data on pathogenic microorganisms, which potentially threatens health of local communities. We performed a qualitative microbial analysis using a whole metagenome sequencing approach encompassing over  gigabases of sequencing data to characterize the Nakivubo wastewater system, which includes a wastewater channel and surrounding wetlands. We found that microbial diversity is heterogeneous throughout the system and that three community state types could be differentiated. We showed the presence of various waterborne agents of gastrointestinal infections in humans, which were associated with leakage occurring around two locations along the wastewater channel. Our data indicate that the microbial decontamination capacity of the local wastewater treatment facility was insufficient at the time of sampling, and that several areas of the wetlands were contaminated with human pathogens, indicating that parts of the wetlands are potentially unsafe for urban agriculture.","doc_id":6237,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13418","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Long-term care and intermediary structures for frail older people : Switzerland and Germany in comparison","authors":"Kehl, Konstantin; Strohmeier Navarro Smith, Rahel","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Long-term care and intermediary structures for frail older people : Switzerland and Germany in comparison;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; This is a post-peer-review, pre-copy edited version of an article published in [International journal of care and caring].

Working from home appears to have considerably changed the work experience of office workers. Newspapers reported an increase in non-specific neck pain as a negative consequence of working from home. Therefore, the main driver for this abstract was to confirm these observations with higher levels of evidence.Purpose of the study: The aim of this analysis was to investigate the effect of the first COVID- lockdown on neck pain. We hypothesised that the COVID- lockdown would increase neck pain.Methods: This longitudinal analysis is based on control group data from an ongoing stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial. Office workers from two Swiss organisations, aged - years, were included. Baseline data collected in January  before the COVID- pandemic were compared with follow-up data collected during the fourth and fifth week of the first lockdown in April . Neck pain was assessed with a measure of intensity (numeric rating scale NRS from  = no pain to  = maximum pain), frequency (number of days within the last  days), and disability (neck disability index from  % = no disability to  % = maximum disability). Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed for statistical analysis as the normality assumption was not met.Results: Data from  participants were analysed. The mean age was . years (ranging from . to .) at baseline and fifty-four participants (. %) were female. At baseline, the meanintensity of neck pain was NRS . (± .), mean frequency of neck pain . /  days (± .), and mean neck disability . % (± .). At follow-up, the mean intensity of neck pain was NRS . (± .), mean frequency of neck pain . /  days (± .), and mean neck disability . % (± .). We found no evidence for a difference in the intensity of neck pain (estimate = .*-,  % CI from -. to ., p-value = .), frequency of neck pain (estimate = .*-,  % CI from -. to ., p-value = .), or neck disability index (estimate = .*-,  % CI from -. to ., p-value = .) between both measurement time points.Conclusion: The first COVID- lockdown did not result in a difference of neck pain among our sample of office workers, neither in intensity nor in frequency nor in disability. Therefore, our hypothesis and the findings of the newspapers could not be confirmed. A higher number of work breaks taken as well as improved working times and work-life balance may have contributed to this result. To enable more comprehensive statements, further dimensions of pain (i.e., duration) and the effect of psychosocial factors (i.e., mental health) would need to be investigated.","doc_id":6406,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19962","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Cancer-induced immunosuppression can enable effectiveness of immunotherapy through bistability generation : a mathematical and computational examination","authors":"Garcia, Victor; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Fu, Feng","subject":"Cancer; Cancer-immune system interaction; Immunotherapy; Mathematical modeling;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Cancer-induced immunosuppression can enable effectiveness of immunotherapy through bistability generation : a mathematical and computational examination; Cancer; Cancer-immune system interaction; Immunotherapy; Mathematical modeling;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Cancer immunotherapies rely on how interactions between cancer and immune system cells are constituted.

Using data of the Swiss National Nutrition Survey menuCH (n = ), two diet quality scores-Alternate Healthy Eating Index and Mediterranean Diet Score-were computed. Linear regression models were used to investigate the determinants of diet quality and chi-square tests were used to test for differences in single score components between language regions. Significantly higher diet quality scores were observed for individuals who were female, older, normal weight, non-Swiss, with tertiary education or moderate-to-high physical activity level. Additionally, residents of the French- and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland scored higher than residents of the German-speaking region. More specifically, the higher diet quality observed in the French- and Italian-speaking regions was mediated by higher scores in the components of alcohol, dairy products, fat, fish, sugar-sweetened beverages and whole grains.

Given this importance of a PI, the present research aims to explore the PI development for a health profession that has not received much attention yet, namely health promotion practitioners. This PI development is particularly interesting as the education and the professional practice of health promotion and prevention practitioners is characterized by extensive inter- and trans-professional collaboration and by the large number of very different career paths; both factors that can be assumed to challenge the development of a strong professional PI. Building on the conceptual background of the identity-status model (Mancini et al., ), students of a newly established health promotion and prevention undergraduate program in Switzerland filled in questionnaires regarding their PI development at the beginning of their studies as well as after the rd semester. As a control group, first year students of the physiotherapy undergraduate program were recruited; a profession that has a long-standing history and relatively well-defined career paths. The status of the PIs and its development during this first year are analyzed and compared between professions.

Holistic treatment includes control of symptoms (e. g., pain, nausea, sleeplessness) as well as psychosocial and spiritual help which is also extended to the relatives of a patient. For advanced cancer patients in palliative care, a crucial phase is the transition from palliative care in the hospital to the home setting, where care around the clock is not guaranteed any more, leads to an increased number of unplanned hospital re-admissions and emergency visits. Physicians aim to fill this care gap by monitoring physical and social activities as well as vital signs. Daily monitoring data, provided to caregivers, could enable caregivers to timely intervene when symptoms of a patient deteriorate. Besides patients in palliative care, also cancer survivors suffering from cancer-related fatigue could benefit from activity monitoring. Up to now, the remedies and effective treatments for cancer-related fatigue are limited. Research still has to unveil the underlying mechanisms that lead to a state of chronic exhaustedness.  Measures that help healthy people like regenerative sleep show no or little effect in fatigued patients. Besides psycho-stimulants that come with the risk of addiction, cognitive behavioural therapy and moderate physical exercise have been shown to be effective. However, research still has to investigate timing, frequency and intensity of physical activity and researchers need a better understanding how the fatigue evolves during the day and in long-term.This thesis investigates the possibilities and limitations of activity monitoring using wearable devices such as smartphones and an armworn devices that is capable of measuring vital signs such as heart rate. Three studies involving cancer patients are conducted:- An interview study including  cancer patients enabled a patient-centric design for an Android activity monitoring app for smartphones.- Only using the smartphone as monitoring device, a study with  cancer survivors suffering from cancer-related fatigue was conducted as a pre-study in order to gain first experiences and to explore the possible knowledge gain about cancer-related fatigue through activity monitoring.- During a planned study period of  weeks per patient,  patients in ambulatory palliative care were wearing a smartphone and the arm-worn sensor as monitoring devices. The age range of the study participants was  to  years. In weekly interviews, patients were asked about their experiences with the devices and their quality of life. The aim of the study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptance of activity monitoring in this patient group.Furthermore, exploratory data analysis investigated the possibilities and limitations of unsupervised methods on this real-world data set. The two data sets, collected during the fatigue study and during the palliative care study, were pre-processed including cleaning steps, classification and clustering methods to add higher level information such as visited locations (anonymized). From these prepared data sets, features were extracted such as number of places visited per day. On the resulting datasets of features, statistical methods were applied to explore relations between sensor data, self-reports and, in case of the palliative care study, emergency visits to the hospital. For the latter analysis, patients who experienced an emergency room visit and those who did not were compared by means of hypothesis testing. For each feature, the underlying alternative hypothesis was that the change of a feature between the first week of study participation at home and the week before an emergency visit (or the last week of study participation for the patients without an emergency visit), differs in the two patient groups. The rate of change was defined by the ratio of the medians of the two weeks. Changes of three features, namely resting heart rate, resting heart rate variability and step speed were identified to have significant group differences:- The resting heart rate had an increasing trend in the group with emergency visits (median=., interquartile range [., .]) and a decreasing trend in the group without an emergency visit (median=., interquartile range [., .]) with a nominal significance of p=. and a medium effect size r=.. - The resting heart rate variability had a decreasing trend in the group with emergency visits (mean=., standard deviation=.) and an increasing trend in the group without an emergency visit (mean=., standard deviation=.) with a nominal significance of p=. and a large effect size r=.. - The step speed had an increasing trend in the group with emergency visits (median=., interquartile range [., .]) and a decreasing trend in the group without an emergency visit (median=., interquartile range [., .]) with a nominal significance of p=. and a large effect size r=..In contrast, hypothesis testing for features based on patients’ subjective self-reports for pain, distres and global quality of life did not reveil any significant differences. Hence, activity monitoring of vital signs and physical activity outperformed patients’ self-reports. However, a power analysis based on the three nominally significant results would recommend an independent study with  patients to confirm the results of this study. Furthermore, a set of recommendations for future research was concluded from the experiences gained through conducting these studies.","doc_id":6704,"prior":"cancer-related","SDG3":1},{"id":"43","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20650","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Monitoring outpatients in palliative care through wearable devices","authors":"Klaas, Vanessa Christina","subject":"Mobile health; Activity monitoring; Palliativa care;  Informatik;  Pflege","type":"Dissertation","bid":"004, 610.73","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Monitoring outpatients in palliative care through wearable devices; Mobile health; Activity monitoring; Palliativa care;  Informatik;  Pflege; Patients in palliative care suffer from a life-threatening disease. Holistic treatment includes control of symptoms (e. g., pain, nausea, sleeplessness) as well as psychosocial and spiritual help which is also extended to the relatives of a patient. For advanced cancer patients in palliative care, a crucial phase is the transition from palliative care in the hospital to the home setting, where care around the clock is not guaranteed any more, leads to an increased number of unplanned hospital re-admissions and emergency visits. Physicians aim to fill this care gap by monitoring physical and social activities as well as vital signs. Daily monitoring data, provided to caregivers, could enable caregivers to timely intervene when symptoms of a patient deteriorate. Besides patients in palliative care, also cancer survivors suffering from cancer-related fatigue could benefit from activity monitoring. Up to now, the remedies and effective treatments for cancer-related fatigue are limited. Research still has to unveil the underlying mechanisms that lead to a state of chronic exhaustedness.  Measures that help healthy people like regenerative sleep show no or little effect in fatigued patients. Besides psycho-stimulants that come with the risk of addiction, cognitive behavioural therapy and moderate physical exercise have been shown to be effective. However, research still has to investigate timing, frequency and intensity of physical activity and researchers need a better understanding how the fatigue evolves during the day and in long-term.This thesis investigates the possibilities and limitations of activity monitoring using wearable devices such as smartphones and an armworn devices that is capable of measuring vital signs such as heart rate.

We used hospital registry data to assess the incidence, treatment durations and hospital costs of ovarian cancer in Switzerland.Methods: We carried out a retrospective analysis of a hospital registry covering all inpatient care episodes in Switzerland between  and . Ovarian cancer incidence was assessed by identifying patients with a first ovarian cancer diagnosis as the main reason for hospital stay after an event-free period. We assessed the duration and cost of ovarian cancer treatment sequences as well as the evolution of hospital patient volume over time.Results: The average age-adjusted incidence rate was . per , women per year between  and . This rate is substantially higher (+.%) than the corresponding rate published by the National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER). Hospital patient volume was low in most cases, with more than % of patients treated in hospitals with fewer than  cases per year. However, the share of patients treated in hospitals with more than  cases per year has increased substantially since .Conclusions: We found a substantial difference between the ovarian cancer incidence estimate based on hospital registry data and the corresponding estimate by NICER. The reasons for this substantial difference should be carefully explored. A case-wise comparison could determine whether the difference is due to over- or under-reporting in one of the two registries. The low ovarian cancer patient volume in many hospitals is in conflict with the numbers required for certified specialised cancer centres. The recent increase in patient volume in specialised cancer centres, however, might reflect a growing understanding of the needs and requirements of comprehensive cancer care.","doc_id":6814,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11302","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Wenn Mama plötzlich krank ist : wie Pflegefachpersonen Kinder mit einem an Krebs erkrankten Elternteil unterstützen können","authors":"Bär, Cynthia Anastasia; Comuzzo, Melina","subject":"Child; Parent; Cancer; Support; Experience; Assistance; Needs; Nurse;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Wenn Mama plötzlich krank ist : wie Pflegefachpersonen Kinder mit einem an Krebs erkrankten Elternteil unterstützen können; Child; Parent; Cancer; Support; Experience; Assistance; Needs; Nurse;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Hintergrund: Erkranken Eltern an Krebs, so sind auch Kinder von den Auswirkungen dieser Krankheit betroffen. Pflegefachpersonen sind im Umgang mit Kindern krebskranker Eltern häufig verunsichert, obwohl sie in der Unterstützung der Familie eine zentrale Rolle spielen. Ziel: Die vorliegende Arbeit hat zum Ziel, das Erleben und die Bedürfnisse von Kindern mit einem an Krebs erkrankten Elternteil zu erkennen und daraus mögliche Interventionen für Pflegefachpersonen abzuleiten.  Methode: Es wurden eine systematische Literaturrecherche in für die Pflege relevanten Datenbanken sowie eine unsystematische Recherche mit dem Schneeballsystem durchgeführt. Es konnten  relevante Studien gefunden werden. Diese wurden gelesen, zusammengefasst und kritisch gewürdigt. Modelle der Familienzentrierten Pflege sowie das Evidence-Based Healthcare-Modell wurden miteinbezogen.  Ergebnisse: Das Erleben kann in die Kategorien Angst, Emotionen, Kommunikation und Wissen sowie Alltag erfasst werden. Sowohl die Bedürfnisse als auch die Interventionen finden in den Bereichen Kommunikation, Information, Coping und dem Alltag Platz.

Persistent stress can be harmful for both physical and mental health. Furthermore, stress affects job performance and may lead to absence from work, thus imposing not only a disruption on a personal and institutional level but also financial burden on society. During corona-times ordinary work life has for many employees been disrupted. This empirical study focus on stress perception of older employees, and their coping strategies. Furthermore, it explores how stress changes during their working career and how they perceived stress during their life course and during the corona crisis.Method: A moderated online-focus group of  minutes was conducted with  participants. All participants were  years of age or older and were mature in their career. Participants were recruited through notices on websites, direct mailings to companies and mailing lists as well as personal contacts. The interview was conducted in December  during the second corona wave in Switzerland. The interview was recorded and transcribed, its content analyzed with content analysis.Results: Participants stated that external control of work-tasks and the responsibility for others as well as unplanned tasks/incidents on top of already high work-load created stress. Not all participants were affected the same through the corona crisis. While some had an increase in tasks and demands, others felt no change. Moreover, already stressful situations got worse through additional work, various communication channels due to home-office situation and disruption of the usual workflow.Own attitude towards work, such as need for recognition, to achieve something in life and perfectionism were powerful motives for participants that lead them in the past frequently into stressful situations or prolonged times under pressure and stress. On the other hand, they felt that prolonged stress was a sign of time, as they felt a faster pace and increased demands, tight deadlines and a general shortage of time at work than it used to. On the other hand, others felt more relaxed now than when they started their career as they felt they already achieved something in life and could better let things be. However, participants stated to need more rest and longer recovery time than they used to.Participants value the possibility to reflect on stress and share personal experiences especially during times when many employees are bound to work at home.Conclusion: While for some the corona crisis lead to additional stress, most factors related to stress were either in the personal mind set and/or preceded the corona situation.","doc_id":6894,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19824","date":"2020","language":"fr","title":"Communication socioculturelle comme outil de prévention des maladies sexuellement transmissibles et le VIH chez les adolescents au Tchad","authors":"Nodjiadjim Laoubaou, Abdias; Wyss, Kaspar; Schwärzler, Patricia; Obrist, Brigit; Bergman, Manfred Max","subject":"Jugendliche; Prävention; HIV; Tschad; AIDS;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"Communication socioculturelle comme outil de prévention des maladies sexuellement transmissibles et le VIH chez les adolescents au Tchad; Jugendliche; Prävention; HIV; Tschad; AIDS;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Les adolescents en milieu urbain au Tchad sont particulièrement exposés au risque d’infection au VIH.

Given these deficiencies, the adolescents express the need to be themselves in charge of preventive actions against sexuality transmitted infections and HIV.","doc_id":7041,"prior":"Medizin","posterior":"accès","SDG3":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22585","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Quantifying transmission fitness costs of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis","authors":"Pecerska, Julija; Kühnert, Denise; Meehan, Conor J.; Coscollá, Mireia; de Jong, Bouke C.; Gagneux, Sebastien; Stadler, Tanja","subject":"Antibiotic resistance; Whole genome M. tuberculosis; Multi-type birth-death model; Phylodynamics;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"614","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Quantifying transmission fitness costs of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; Antibiotic resistance; Whole genome M. tuberculosis; Multi-type birth-death model; Phylodynamics;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; As multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) continues to spread, investigating the transmission potential of different drug-resistant strains becomes an ever more pressing topic in public health.

The nurses attend these studies alongside employment which are based on a modular system with eight presence days per module (DAS =  modules). Due to the actual COVID- situation and the nurses’ shortage in clinics, classroom teaching was no longer possible.MethodsAs a consequence and due to future learning trends, we generated the “breast care module” as a blended (face-to-face and virtual) module starting with a detailed content and target audience analysis. We illustrated the whole blended-learning course in a “scripting tool” with expert experiences included.ResultsThe didactic methodology was adjusted by intensifying self-directed learning using Moodle, an online learning management system using Webinars, Wiki, peer-feedback, lessons-learned. The AVIVA methodology was utilised for the online course as well as for in-person classes. On the content aspect, new topics like pregnancy and breast cancer, genetic counselling, plastic surgery methods, follow-up care and survivorship were included.ConclusionsThis course is conducive to learning as it provides a deeper insight in specific topics and allows for independent learning at a time, that is most convenient for the participants. This is advantageous for nurses who work shifts. Despite distance learning, alternating classroom meetings are important for socialising and networking. Furthermore, a continuous theory-practice transfer on evidence-based decision-making and positive experience with an autonomous learning system is the basis for fruitful life-long learning. This course will support the participants in caring for women during the whole cancer care continuum process with high quality and patient satisfaction.","doc_id":7085,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5732","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Estimation of input costs for a Markov model in a German health economic evaluation of newer antidepressants","authors":"Seidl, Astrid; Danner, Marion; Wagner, Christoph J.; Sandmann, Frank G.; Sroczynski, Gaby; Stürzlinger, Heidi; Zsifkovits, Johannes; Schwalm, Anja; Lhachimi, Stefan K.; Siebert, Uwe; Gerber-Grote, Andreas","subject":" Produktion","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Estimation of input costs for a Markov model in a German health economic evaluation of newer antidepressants;  Produktion; Background: Estimating input costs for Markov models in health economic evaluations requires health state-specific costing. This is a challenge in mental illnesses such as depression, as interventions are not clearly related to health states. We present a hybrid approach to health state-specific cost estimation for a German health economic evaluation of antidepressants. Methods: Costs were determined from the perspective of the community of persons insured by statutory health insurance (“SHI insuree perspective”) and included costs for outpatient care, inpatient care, drugs, and psychotherapy. In an additional step, costs for rehabilitation and productivity losses were calculated from the societal perspective. We collected resource use data in a stepwise hierarchical approach using SHI claims data, where available, followed by data from clinical guidelines and expert surveys. Bottom-up and top-down costing approaches were combined. Results: Depending on the drug strategy and health state, the average input costs varied per patient per -week Markov cycle. The highest costs occurred for agomelatine in the health state first-line treatment (FT) (“FT relapse”) with € from the SHI insuree perspective and € from the societal perspective. From both perspectives, the lowest costs (excluding placebo) were € for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the health state “FT remission.” Conclusion: To estimate costs in health economic evaluations of treatments for depression, it can be necessary to link different data sources and costing approaches systematically to meet the requirements of the decision-analytic model. As this can increase complexity, the corresponding calculations should be presented transparently. The approach presented could provide useful input for future models.","doc_id":7109,"prior":"mental illnesses","SDG3":1},{"id":"38","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21992","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Impact of a diabetes disease management program on quality of care and costs : propensity score-matched real-world data from Switzerland","authors":"Carlander, Maria; Höglinger, Marc; Trottmann, Maria; Rhomberg, Birgitta; Caviglia, Cornelia; Rohrbasser, Adrian; Frei, Christian; Eichler, Klaus","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362, 616","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Impact of a diabetes disease management program on quality of care and costs : propensity score-matched real-world data from Switzerland;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Objectives: Structured treatment programs have been recommended for management of patients with chronic conditions to overcome ill-coordinated care.

Methods: We performed a prospective observational study with a propensity score-matched usual care control group from a claims database. We included type- and type- diabetes patients from a primary care setting. The DMP (intervention) comprised a structured treatment approach with an individual treatment plan, treatment goals and an interprofessional team approach. Our comprehensive outcome measures included quality of life (QOL: EQ-D-L), pre-defined indicators for diabetes guideline adherence, number of used services and direct medical costs. We applied a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to compare DMP with usual care (follow-up  year).

Results: QOL in a sub-sample of  patients did not change during follow-up (mean utility . at baseline and follow-up; p=.). Guideline adherence showed slight improvements for DMP. For example, “non-adherence” (baseline DMP: %) decreased in the DMP group by - %-points (DID; %-CI: -. to .) but not in the control group. A general trend emerged, though mostly not statistically significant, with less used services in the DMP group compared to the control group. Costs increased in both groups during follow-up, but the increase was higher in the control group (DID, mean total costs per patient per year: CHF -. [%-CI: -. to .]). Such a negative difference-in-difference estimate in favor of DMP also emerged for cost sub-categories (e.g. costs for inpatient and outpatient care).

In particular, the importance of soy as an element in feedstuff is examined in depth.The analysis is centred around the misleading statement that % of the feedstuff in Switzerland comes from ‘native meadows and fields’. This percentage is based on the combination of roughage and concentrated feed, two categories of feedstuff that must not be added because they have limited substitutability and are therefore not directly comparable. Roughage is eaten mainly by ruminants. Meat, however, comes primarily from pigs and poultry which are both dependent on concentrated feed. Roughage is almost % domestically sourced, while more than % of concentrated feed comes from abroad. Protein is particularly scarce: around % of the protein in concentrated feed comes from imports (mainly soy).Therefore, if today’s feedstuff were not imported, livestock populations would decline significantly, particularly those that are dependent on concentrated feed. According to model calculations, it would be possible to keep % of sheep and goats, % of cattle, % of pigs and % of poultry on the basis of domestic feed alone. At  kg per capita per year, meat production would be halved in comparison to the present day. Pork would remain the most important type of meat, although it would be over % less compared to today. Poultry meat would virtually disappear. However, around  kg of milk could still be produced per capita annually.Swiss agriculture specialises in the production of livestock. About % of agricultural land is used for animal feed, in addition to the at least , hectares of arable areas abroad which are used for the cultivation of animal feedstuff for the Swiss market. Soybeans, wheat, corn, etc. grow on these areas.Since the mid-s, the importing of feedstuff has increased sharply, most of which is imported from Europe. The most important protein feed which is imported is soy, which, due to public criticism, now tends to increasingly come from Europe. Most of the imported feedstuffs are in direct competition with human foods. This is because they come from crops that we humans can eat directly, including not only all cereals such as wheat, corn, rice, oats and barley, but also soybeans.In intensive livestock farming, the calorie content present in plant-based foods that we humans are able eat directly is converted into a lot less in animal food products. In this process, the production of meat ‘destroys’ significantly more plant-derived calories than that of milk. This is because milk still contains a lot of grass that only cows and other ruminants can digest.Soy is the world's most important animal protein feedstuff. Originally, soybeans were cultivated in Asia for human consumption. Today, about % of global production is used to feed livestock, more than half of which is used for chicken fattening. While poultry consume by far the most soy protein feed on a global scale, in Switzerland it is cattle which rank first in this regard. This is the result of the central importance of milk production and the breeding of performance breeds that depend on protein-rich concentrated feed.Global soy production has grown steadily in recent years, and in Brazil even exponentially. Approximately half of all soy is used for feeding or consumption purposes in growing countries, while the other half is traded internationally. The main producing and exporting countries are the U.S. and Brazil while the main importing countries are China and the EU.Brazil is still the most important source region for Swiss soybean imports. The country grows soybeans for the global market: around % of production is exported. Only % of Brazil's farms cultivate soybeans and only % of soybean farms are family-owned. In the past  years production has expanded, especially in the ecologically valuable Cerrado and Amazon biomes. There, the average soybean acreage is  ha (Amazonas) and  ha (Cerrado).The supply chains for soy imported into Switzerland are not transparent. The description ‘responsibly produced’ glosses over soy production in Brazil and the soy trade. According to research, Swiss soy imports from Brazil come from specialised, large-scale farms with intensive soy cultivation, monotonous crop rotations and high pesticide use. Most of these farms are located in the state of Mato Grosso, i.e. in the Cerrado or Amazon biome, where most land has been cleared in recent decades.ProTerra-certified soy also comes from original rainforest (Amazon) or savanna (Cerrado) areas. ‘Zero deforestation’ refers only to the last decade.Animal food products constitutes a billion-dollar business in Switzerland. The supply chains show a high market concentration in inputs (feedstuff), in processing (meat, dairy milk) and in wholesale and retail trade. A few companies, especially the conglomerates Coop, Migros and fenaco, dominate the markets. The industrialisation of production in efficient international supply chains is most advanced in the production of eggs and chicken. Here, too, the supply chains are not very transparent.According to model calculations, more than % of the total greenhouse gas emissions due to Swiss agriculture are directly attributable to livestock farming, % to the rest of agriculture and about % occur in the countries where animal feedstuff is grown. If feedstuff were not imported, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by %. The nitrogen surpluses in Swiss agriculture are also largely a result of livestock farming. More than % of the surpluses occur in Switzerland. Without feedstuff imports, the nitrogen surpluses in Switzerland would be reduced by %.The results of the research and model calculations thus lead to five conclusions:I.\tThe industry's advertising images and messages are misleading and gloss over livestock farming in Switzerland and its dependence on imports. They shape the perceptions of the population and increase the demand for animal food products \"from Switzerland\".II.\tGovernmental agencies do little to educate the population about Swiss livestock farming. They support the misleading images and messages through official terminology and reporting. Political interests favour production and sales interests over the many other societal concerns (e.g. health, environment, animal welfare, transparency, economic costs, reliability of supply).III.\tIt is not Swiss agriculture that benefits most from fedstuff imports. This is because agriculture does not depend solely on production for its income; it receives income-securing direct payments. Rather, imports are in the interest of upstream and downstream industries. They are the ones who mainly benefit from a high rate of livestock farming at discounted prices.IV.\tSwiss chicken production is a clear example: the doubling of production in the last  years has benefited a few upstream and downstream companies, a handful of global breeding companies and only a very small proportion of farms. The expansion of chicken fattening is a questionable development in Swiss livestock farming. It is further encouraged by the current debate concerning the environment and the climate as chicken is considered resource-efficient and ‘climate friendly’.V.\tAs a guiding principle for the future, it is proposed that Swiss livestock farming be adapted to the local ecosystem boundaries in Switzerland, and that the consumption by the Swiss population be adapted to global ecosystem boundaries. This would mean being able to halve meat consumption at the very least.","doc_id":7260,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2997","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Technical and instrumental competence in the translator's workplace : using process research to identify educational and ergonomic needs","authors":"Massey, Gary; Ehrensberger-Dow, Maureen","subject":"Professional translator; ErgoTrans; Translation process; Ergonomics;  Informatik;  Translationswissenschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"004, 418.02","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Technical and instrumental competence in the translator's workplace : using process research to identify educational and ergonomic needs; Professional translator; ErgoTrans; Translation process; Ergonomics;  Informatik;  Translationswissenschaft; Although technical and instrumental competence feature prominently in translation competence models and profiles, systematic cognitive research has only recently focused on how they develop, how they can be fostered, and how today's technologies, tools and information resources are impacting on the workplace processes and practices of translators.

GBS possesses a broad animal host spectrum, and recent studies proved atypical GBS genotypes can cause human invasive diseases through animal sources as food-borne zoonotic infections. We applied a MALDI-TOF MS typing method, based on molecular weight variations of predefined  ribosomal subunit proteins (rsp) to classify GBS strains of varying serotypes into major phylogenetic lineages. A total of  GBS isolates of representative and varying capsular serotypes from patients and animal food sources (fish and pig) collected during - in Hong Kong were analysed. Over % (/) noninvasive carriage GBS strains from patients were readily typed into  globally dominant rsp-profiles. Among GBS strains from food animals, over % (/) of fish and % (/) of pig GBS matched with existing rsp-profiles, while the remainder were classified into two novel rsp-profiles and we failed to assign a fish strain into any cluster. MALDI-TOF MS allowed for high-throughput screening and simultaneous detection of novel, so far not well described GBS genotypes. The method shown here is rapid, simple, readily transferable and adapted for use in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory with potential for the surveillance of emerging GBS genotypes with zoonotic potential.","doc_id":7433,"prior":"diseases","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5688","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Statistical disclosure control for microdata : methods and applications in R","authors":"Templ, Matthias","subject":" Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Buch","bid":"005","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Statistical disclosure control for microdata : methods and applications in R;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; This book on statistical disclosure control presents the theory, applications and software implementation of the traditional approach to (micro)data anonymization, including data perturbation methods, disclosure risk, data utility, information loss and methods for simulating synthetic data.

However, to our knowledge, the association of multiprofessional preoperative assessment, information, and briefing with postoperative outcomes has not been evaluated.Objective: To compare postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), readmissions, mortality, and costs per case among patients undergoing complex oncologic HNC surgery before and after the implementation of a comprehensive preoperative multiprofessional assessment and information day (MUPAID).Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, single-center case-control study was conducted at a tertiary referral head and neck anticancer center/university cancer institute and compared patients with HNC who were undergoing complex oncological surgeries between January  and July  before (control group) and after (intervention group) implementation of the institutional MUPAID. Data analysis was conducted between  and . The intervention group comprised patients who participated in the MUPAID beginning in February . These patients were assessed by a multiprofessional team and provided with structured and comprehensive information on the surgical procedure and its functional, social, financial, and psychological effects, as well as the postoperative care, rehabilitation, and follow-up period. Patients in the control group had also undergone complex oncologic HNC surgery and were selected through surgical procedure codes.Main Outcomes and Measures: The end points were postoperative rate and severity of complications, LOS, readmissions, mortality, and costs per case.Results: The study included  patients,  in the intervention ( women [.%]) and  in the control group ( women [.%]). The groups showed no relevant differences in sociodemographic, disease, and procedural characteristics. The intervention cohort presented with fewer major local and systemic complications (Clavien-Dindo score, III-V: .% vs .%; difference proportion, −.; % CI, −. to −.), shorter median LOS ( days [IQR, - days] vs  days [IQR, -] days; effect size, .; % CI Cohen d, .-.) and decreased median charge per case ($  [IQR, $ -$ ] vs $  [IQR, $ -$ ]; effect size, .; % CI Cohen d, .-.).Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this case-control study suggest that MUPAID for patients who are undergoing complex oncologic HNC surgery is associated with shortened LOS and costs per case as well as decreased complications severity. These results are promising on a patient level in the potential to minimize individual treatment burden, as well as on an institutional and health care system level in the potential significant optimization of surgical outcomes and financial aspects.","doc_id":7537,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12457","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Reasons why people in Switzerland seek assisted suicide : the view of patients and physicians","authors":"Fischer, S.; Huber, C.A.; Furter, M.; Imhof, Lorenz; Mahrer Imhof, Romy; Schwarzenegger, C.; Ziegler, S.J.; Bosshard, G.","subject":"Right-to-die; Assisted; Dying; Suicide;  Psychologie;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"150, 362","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Reasons why people in Switzerland seek assisted suicide : the view of patients and physicians; Right-to-die; Assisted; Dying; Suicide;  Psychologie;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Background: Assisted suicide is permitted in Switzerland provided that assistance is not motivated by selfish reasons.

Improved air quality was associated with attenuated reductions in FEV/FVC, FEF-, and FEF-/FVC over time among low- and normal-BMI participants, but not overweight or obese participants.

According to the WHO, iron deficiency is the single most important nutritional risk factor in India, accounting for more than % of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. We estimate the social costs of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in --month-old children in India in terms of intangible costs and production losses.Materials and Methods: We build a health economic model estimating the life-time costs of a birth cohort suffering from IDA between the ages of  and  months. The model is stratified by  age groups (- and --months),  geographical areas (urban and rural),  socio-economic strata and  degrees of severity of IDA (mild, moderate and severe). Prevalence of anemia is calculated with the last available National Family Health Survey. Information on the health consequences of IDA is extracted from the literature.Results: IDA prevalence is .% in --month-old and .% in --month-old children. Children living in poor households in rural areas are particularly affected but prevalence is high even in wealthy urban households. The estimated yearly costs of IDA in –-month-old children amount to intangible costs of . m DALYs and production losses of , m USD, equal to .% of gross domestic product. Previous calculations have considerably underestimated the intangible costs of IDA as the improved WHO methodology leads to a threefold increase of DALYs due to IDA.Conclusion: Despite years of iron supplementation programs and substantial economic growth, IDA remains a crucial public health issue in India and an obstacle to the economic advancement of the poor. Young children are especially vulnerable due to the irreversible effects of IDA on cognitive development. Our research may contribute to the design of new effective interventions aiming to reduce IDA in early childhood.","doc_id":8010,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17169","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Experiences with a psychosocial screening instrument (S‐FIRST) to identify the psychosocial support needs of parents of children suffering from cancer","authors":"Haunberger, Sigrid; Rüegger, Cornelia; Baumgartner, Edgar","subject":"ROC curve; Case history; Clinical social work; Psychosocial counseling; Screening instrument; Social diagnosis;  Psychologie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"150, 616","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Experiences with a psychosocial screening instrument (S‐FIRST) to identify the psychosocial support needs of parents of children suffering from cancer; ROC curve; Case history; Clinical social work; Psychosocial counseling; Screening instrument; Social diagnosis;  Psychologie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; This is the peer reviewed version which has been published in final form at https://doi.org/./pon..

Extracts prepared from the cultivated strains able to inhibit Staphylococcus aureusand Escherichia coliwere further analysed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS to identify the produced antibiotics. In this study, the bioactive compound echinomycin was identified from two isolated Streptomycesstrains. Natural compounds similar to TPU--C, azalomycin Fa -ethylpentyl ester, a derivative of bafilomycin A, milbemycin-α and dihydropicromycin were detected from different isolated Streptomyces strains. Milbemycin-α showed cytotoxic activity against HT- colon cancer cells. The rare actinomycete,Micromonospora sp. Stup_C produced a compound that matches with the antibiotic bottromycin A.

Electrospun nanofibers with their large specific surface area and a porous structure are known as attractive materials in filtration processes. However, dead-end filtration of cells through nanofiber mats (NFM) always leads to cake formation and increasing resistance. In this study, for the first time, a nanofiber sponge (NFS) or nanofiber aerogel was synthetized from polyamide  (PA) building blocks. The NFS was flexible, highly porous and mechanically stable. The pore size of the NFS was tuned between  and  µm during the cryogenic processing step. Volumetric flux and filtration efficiency of the NFS depended on the pore size and the results were compared with those for NFM from the same PA nanofiber material. Dead-end filtration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was feasible at a low differential pressure of . kPa and cell filtration efficiency was >  %. Modelling of the filtration process revealed that cake formation is prevented by NFS filters since cells are able to penetrate into the filter and to adsorb on their internal surface. The filtration characteristics were also compared with commercial depth filters and revealed the high flux of NFS filters along with the possibility to avoid filter aids and a low environmental impact. PA-NFS filters may become a new and cost effective generation of filters for removing different cells or cell debris from broth and other applications.","doc_id":8185,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"89","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13421","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Predicting threshold exceedance by local block means in soil pollution surveys","authors":"Hofer, Christoph; Papritz, Andreas","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Predicting threshold exceedance by local block means in soil pollution surveys;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Soil contamination by heavy metals and organic pollutants around industrial premises is a problem in many countries around the world. Delineating zones where pollutants exceed tolerable levels is a necessity for successfully mitigating related health risks. Predictions of pollutants are usually required for blocks because remediation or regulatory decisions are imposed for entire parcels. Parcel areas typically exceed the observation support, but are smaller than the survey domain. Mapping soil pollution therefore involves a local change of support. The goal of this work is to find a simple, robust, and precise method for predicting block means (linear predictions) and threshold exceedance by block means (nonlinear predictions) from data observed at points that show a spatial trend. By simulations, we compared the performance of universal block kriging (UK), Gaussian conditional simulations (CS), constrained (CK), and covariance-matching constrained kriging (CMCK), for linear and nonlinear local change of support prediction problems. We considered Gaussian and positively skewed spatial processes with a nonstationary mean function and various scenarios for the autocorrelated error. The linear predictions were assessed by bias and mean square prediction error and the nonlinear predictions by bias and Peirce skill scores.For Gaussian data and blocks with locally dense sampling, all four methods performed well, both for linear and nonlinear predictions. When sampling was sparse CK and CMCK gave less precise linear predictions, but outperformed UK for nonlinear predictions, irrespective of the data distribution. CK and CMCK were only outperformed by CS in the Gaussian case when threshold exceedance was predicted by the conditional quantiles. However, CS was strongly biased for the skewed data whereas CK and CMCK still provided unbiased and quite precise nonlinear predictions. CMCK did not show any advantages over CK. CK is as simple to compute as UK. We recommend therefore this method to predict block means and nonlinear transforms thereof because it offers a good compromise between robustness, simplicity, and precision.","doc_id":8265,"prior":"health risks","SDG3":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3280","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Standardized 3D bioprinting of soft tissue models with human primary cells","authors":"Rimann, Markus; Bono, Epifania; Annaheim, Helene; Bleisch, Matthias; Graf-Hausner, Ursula","subject":"Soft tissue models; 3D cell culture; Bioprinting; Automation, standardization;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Standardized D bioprinting of soft tissue models with human primary cells; Soft tissue models; D cell culture; Bioprinting; Automation, standardization;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Cells grown in D are more physiologically relevant than cells cultured in D.

Total costs included direct medical and non-medical costs and lost production. All costs were calculated for the year  from a societal perspective using a prevalence-based bottom-up approach. Intangible costs were expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALY) lost and were calculated from Swiss life tables, standardized mortality ratios and utility weights from the literature. Uncertainty and its sources were addressed in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.ResultsThe point prevalence of schizophrenia in  was estimated at .% of the Swiss population. The average annual costs of schizophrenia amounted to EUR , per patient and consisted of direct medical costs of EUR , (%), the costs of care by relatives and in residential homes of EUR , (%) and lost production of EUR , (%). Inpatient hospital care accounted for EUR , per year or % of direct medical costs. The estimated reduction in life expectancy of . years and the utility decrement of . percentage points lead to intangible costs of .

The high costs of inpatient hospital care demonstrate the benefits of an effective prevention of relapse associated with hospitalization. Programs for the reintegration of schizophrenic patients into the labor market have a high potential to reduce the costs of schizophrenia considering the high burden of lost production and the early onset of the disease.","doc_id":8341,"prior":"life expectancy","SDG3":1},{"id":"54","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7180","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Umsiedlung von Dohlenkrebsbeständen (Austropotamobius pallipes) im Kanton Basel-Landschaft (Schweiz)","authors":"Babbi, Manuel; Graber, Andreas; Küry, Daniel","subject":"Umsiedlung; Austropotamobius pallipes; Basel-Landschaft; Dohlenkrebs;  Ökologie;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577, 590","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Umsiedlung von Dohlenkrebsbeständen (Austropotamobius pallipes) im Kanton Basel-Landschaft (Schweiz); Umsiedlung; Austropotamobius pallipes; Basel-Landschaft; Dohlenkrebs;  Ökologie;  Tiere (Zoologie); Die Abteilung Veterinär-, Jagd- und Fischereiwesen des Kantons Basel-Landschaft hat  ein Umsiedlungsprojekt mit Dohlenkrebsen (Austropotamobius pallipes, Rote Liste ) gestartet.

This leads to explosive growth of genetic databases and development of novel sequencing-based approaches to study various biological phenomena. The database growth was particularly beneficial for investigation of protein-coding sequences at the codon level, requiring the access to large sets of related genomes. Such studies are expected to illuminate biological forces that shape primary structure of coding sequences and predict their evolutionary trajectories more precisely. In addition to fundamental interest, codon usage studies are of ample practical value, for example, in drug discovery and genomic medicine areas. Nevertheless, the depth of our understanding of codon-related issues is currently shallower as compared to what we know about nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Besides the lack of adequate datasets in the early days of molecular biology, codon usage studies, in our opinion, suffer from underdevelopment of easy-to-use tools to analyze and visualize how codon sequence changes along the gene and across the homologous genes in course of evolution. In this review, we aim to describe main areas of codon usage studies with an emphasis on the tools that allow visual interpretation of the data.

Producers are facing ever-falling prices, environmental changes and increasing requirements for state supports. Facing these challenges, some farmers have developed their own products for niche markets, adopted rare or ancient breeds or demonstrated the capacity to adopt income-generating innovations. The diversification of agricultural production on farms and within whole regional landscapes has further advantages than just income diversification. It offers adaptation and buffer capacity in case of economic crisis or environmental changes and it makes the agro-ecosystem more resistant to pests and diseases and distributes risks. However, the majority of farms still encounters barriers in changing crops and diversifying. Interviews with producers in this study revealed that the main challenges are the lack of technical information about rare crops and breeds, the need to identify adapted crops and equipment to the location  and the personal motivations that require an entrepreunarial or risk-taker personality. Information technologies and particularly new tools in the area of social networking could play an important role in increasing access to information and connections between peers, even internationally, and deserve more attention in the transition to sustainable agriculture. Interviews with market actors revealed multiple potentials for niche products, but also the need for increased availability of market information to producers. Social media are also starting to be used for this purpose. This study thus looked into the potential of multi-stakeholder online platforms and the role of key actors for the diffusion of innovation and niche products in agriculture and identified current limitations where efforts could be put to increase support to diversifying producers.","doc_id":8631,"prior":"diseases","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"78","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23511","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Snus oder Zigarette - welches Tabakprodukt ist gesundheitsschädlicher? : ein Scoping Review über den Vergleich zweier Produkte","authors":"Koller, Seraina","subject":"Snus; Gesundheitsrisiko; Krankheit; Tabak; Zigarette;  Persönliche Gesundheit;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"613, 616.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Snus oder Zigarette - welches Tabakprodukt ist gesundheitsschädlicher? : ein Scoping Review über den Vergleich zweier Produkte; Snus; Gesundheitsrisiko; Krankheit; Tabak; Zigarette;  Persönliche Gesundheit;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Thema: Circa   Personen konsumieren in der Schweiz Snus (Tendenz steigend) und jede vierte Person raucht Zigaretten.

Es ist bekannt, dass die Therapieadhärenz in den ersten sechs Monaten einer Therapie drastisch sinkt und bei  bis % liegt. Eine Vernachlässigung der Therapie kann zu Resistenzen führen.Fragestellung: Wie können Pflegefachpersonen Erwachsene mit Tuberkulose im ambulanten Setting bei der Therapieadhärenz wirksam unterstützen?Methode: Es wurde eine Literaturrecherche in drei pflegerelevanten Datenbanken durchgeführt. Anschliessend wurden die sechs gefundenen Studien zusammengefasst, ihre Güte wurde beurteilt und die Studien wurden diskutiert. Ergebnisse: Anhand der Ergebnisse der Studien haben sich sieben Themenbereiche ergeben, die bei der Betreuung von tuberkulosekranken Menschen von Bedeutung sind: das Einbeziehen der Familie, die Stigmatisierung, die Nebenwirkungen, die Beziehung und Kommunikation, das menschliche Leiden, die kulturellen Unterschiede und die finanzielle Situation.Schlussfolgerung: Durch die Ergebnisse und das durchgeführte Experteninterview können Empfehlungen für die Praxis zum Umgang mit Tb-Betroffenen abgegeben werden.

In addition, hyperthermia (HT) is known to be a tumor cell radio-sensitizer. How HT could enhance the anti-tumor immune response produced by RT is still an open question. The aim of this study is the evaluation of potential dynamic effects regarding the adaptive immune response induced by different combinations of RT fractions with HT. The adaptive immune system is considered as a trainable unit (perceptron) which compares danger signals released by necrotic or apoptotic cell death with the presence of tumor- and host tissue cell population-specific molecular patterns (antigens). To mimic the changes produced by HT such as cell radio-sensitization or increase of the blood perfusion after hyperthermia, simplistic biophysical models were included. To study the effectiveness of the different RT+HT treatments, the Tumor Control Probability (TCP) was calculated. In the considered scenarios, the major effect of HT is related to the enhancement of the cell radio-sensitivity while perfusion or heat-based effects on the immune system seem to contribute less. Moreover, no tumor vaccination effect has been observed. In the presented scenarios, HT boosts the RT cell killing but it does not fundamentally change the anti-tumor immune response.","doc_id":8716,"prior":"vaccination","SDG3":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8710","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Rasch analysis of the General Self-Efficacy Scale in a sample of persons with morbid obesity","authors":"Bonsaksen, Tore; Kottorp, Anders; Gay, Caryl; Fagermoen, May; Lerdal, Anners","subject":"Morbid obesity; Prospective study; Psychometrics; Quality of life; Self efficacy;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Rasch analysis of the General Self-Efficacy Scale in a sample of persons with morbid obesity; Morbid obesity; Prospective study; Psychometrics; Quality of life; Self efficacy;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Background: Self-efficacy is needed for effectuating lifestyle changes, and it is therefore an important target related to health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) using Rasch analysis in a sample of adults with morbid obesity.Methods: A convenience sample of adults with morbid obesity was recruited from patient education courses. A total of  participants completed the GSE and a demographic questionnaire at the beginning of the course. The statistical approach included analysis of rating scale function, item fit to the Rasch partial credit model, unidimensionality, aspects of person-response validity, person-separation reliability, and differential item function. A version omitting items with poor fit to the Rasch model was also evaluated.Results: The rating scale did not advance monotonically for item # in the original -item version, and the first three GSE items did not demonstrate acceptable goodness-of-fit to the Rasch model. In a -item version omitting these three items, the rating scale functioned well for all items, and all items demonstrated good fit to the Rasch model. Both the -item and -item versions of the GSE partially met the criteria for unidimensionality. Neither version met the criterion for person response validity, although the results were slightly better for the -item than for the -item version. Both versions of the GSE demonstrated the ability to separate the respondents into three distinct levels of general self-efficacy. Several items had differential item function in relation to age, education or work status, but there were fewer in the -item version.Conclusions: For adults with morbid obesity, a -item version of the GSE seems to have better psychometric properties than the original -item version.","doc_id":8745,"prior":"obesity","SDG3":1},{"id":"100","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23514","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Eine Stimme für Betroffene : qualitative Interviews über Stigmatisierung von psychisch erkrankten Menschen","authors":"Hummel, Lisa","subject":"Verhalten; Psychische Gesundheit; Psychische Krankheit; Stigmatisierung; Stigma; Vorurteile; Betroffene; Wünsche von Betroffenen; Psychischen Herausforderungen;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"616.89","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Eine Stimme für Betroffene : qualitative Interviews über Stigmatisierung von psychisch erkrankten Menschen; Verhalten; Psychische Gesundheit; Psychische Krankheit; Stigmatisierung; Stigma; Vorurteile; Betroffene; Wünsche von Betroffenen; Psychischen Herausforderungen;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie; Einleitung und Ziele: Stigmatisierung von psychisch erkrankten Menschen bringt eine Vielzahl von individuellen und sozialen Negativfolgen mit sich. Für wirksame und nachhaltige Entstigmstisierungsarbeit ist der Einbezug von Betroffenen zentral. Infolgedessen erhebt die vorliegende Bachelorarbeiten subjektive Bedeutungs- und Wahrnehmungsfaktoren von Betroffenen zum Thema Stigmatisierung von psychisch erkrankten Menschen. Die Arbeit identifiziert ausserdem, welches Verhalten und welchen Umgang sich Betroffene von ihrem Umfeld wünschen, um sich akzeptiert, unterstützt und als ganzheitlicher Teil der Gesellschaft zu fühlen. Betroffenen soll dadurch eine Stimme gegeben werden. Methode: Für die Datenerhebung werden teilstrukturierte qualitative Interviews mit vier Menschen durchgeführt, die Erfahrungen mit psychischen Schwierigkeiten haben. Die Auswertung erfolgt durch die inhaltlich strukturierte qualitative Inhaltsanalyse nach Mayring. Ergebnisse: Betroffene definieren und nehmen Stigmatisierung unterschiedlich wahr. Stigmatisierung wird als nicht fassbares Phänomen, dass in der Gesellschaft ganz klar besteht und Negativfolgen mit sich bringt, beschrieben. Betroffene wünschen sich mehr Transparenz und Akzeptanz bei psychischen Schwierigkeiten. Die offene Kommunikation über psychische Schwierigkeiten ist ein wichtiger Schlüsselpunkt. Schlussfolgerung: Stigmatisierung von psychisch erkrankten Menschen ist für Betroffenen in der Schweiz eine Hürde für ihr Wohlergehen. Daten über konkrete Verhaltens- und Umgangswünsche an aussenstehende Menschen könnten zur Reduzierung der Hilflosigkeit seitens der Bevölkerung im Umgang mit psychisch erkrankten Menschen beitragen.

A decomposition of Swiss National Health Accounts; Cost-of-illness; Decomposition by disease; Healthcare cost; Healthcare expenditure; National health account; Switzerland;  Gesundheitsökonomie; In most countries, surprisingly little is known on how national healthcare spending is distributed across diseases. Single-disease cost-of-illness studies cover only a few of the diseases affecting a population and in some cases lead to untenably large estimates. The objective of this study was to decompose healthcare spending in , according to Swiss National Health Accounts, into  collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive major disease categories. Diseases were classified following the Global Burden of Disease Study. We first assigned the expenditures directly mapping from National Health Accounts to the  diseases. The remaining expenditures were assigned based on diagnostic codes and clues contained in a variety of microdata sources. Expenditures were dominated by non-communicable diseases with a share of .%. Cardiovascular diseases stood out with .% of total spending, followed by musculoskeletal disorders (.%), and mental and substance use disorders (.%). Neoplasms (.% of the total) ranked only sixth, although they are the leading cause of premature death in Switzerland. These results may be useful for the design of health policies, as they illustrate how healthcare spending is influenced by the epidemiological transition and increasing life expectancy. They also provide a plausibility check for single cost-of-illness studies.

Investments to improve nutrition make a positive contribution to long-term national and global health, economic productivity and stability, and societal resilience.","doc_id":9247,"prior":"life expectancy","SDG3":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9240","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Vereinbarkeit von Mindestpreisen für alkoholische Getränke mit dem Freihandelsabkommen und der Bundesverfassung","authors":"Pärli, Kurt; Lehne, Jens","subject":" Öffentliches Recht (CH), Sachen-, Finanz-, Steuer- und Wirtschaftsrecht","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"343","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Vereinbarkeit von Mindestpreisen für alkoholische Getränke mit dem Freihandelsabkommen und der Bundesverfassung;  Öffentliches Recht (CH), Sachen-, Finanz-, Steuer- und Wirtschaftsrecht; Die Alkoholhandelsgesetzgebung wird zurzeit () revidiert.

Therapiegärten tragen zum Behandlungserfolg bei, indem sie den positiven Effekt der Natur auf den menschlichen Körper mit einem Raum für Therapien und Aktivitäten in einem geschützten Rahmen verbinden. In dieser Arbeit wurden die planerischen Anforderungen an Therapiegärten für Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen erarbeitet und beschrieben, wie das Medium Garten den Heilungsprozess unterstützen kann. Dazu wurde mittels einer Internetrecherche untersucht, ob in der Schweiz sowie in Liechtenstein bereits Therapiegärten für Personen mit einer psychischen Störung existieren. Dabei konnte ein Therapiegarten der Psychiatrische Dienste Aargau AG (PDAG) sowie ein «Alpengarten», der auf Depression spezialisierten Privatklinik Clinicum Alpinum, eruiert werden. Beide Gärten wurden untersucht und analysiert, wie diese in die Behandlung der Klientel miteinbezogen werden. Es konnte herausgefunden werden, dass der Therapiegarten der PDAG als Teil der Arbeitstherapie der Klinik gestaltet wurde und die Clinicum Alpinum vermehrt die Umgebung, als den Garten, als Therapieort nutzte. Mittels zweier Fachpersoneninterviews, mit dem Gartentherapeuten und der Gartentherapeutin der PDAG sowie einer Psychologin der Luzerner Psychiatrie, wurde mit ersteren die Durchführung der Gartentherapie an der PDAG eruiert und mit letzterer die therapeutischen Ziele bei Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen besprochen und analysiert, wie ein Therapiegarten die Behandlung unterstützen kann. Aufgrund einer Literaturrecherche sowie den Interviews wurden Räume und Orte definiert, die für Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen während der Rehabilitation besonders unterstützend sind und welche Pflanzen und Elemente in einem Therapiegarten eingesetzt werden sollten. Dabei wurde festgestellt, dass abgelegene und sichere Räume mit dem Fokus auf die wilde Natur sowie einer grossen floristischen und faunistischen Artenvielfalt von Personen mit einer Stressfolgeerkrankung besonders präferiert werden. Weiter sollten simple, stabile und schöne Objekte in einem Therapiegarten vorhanden sein, da Beziehungen von Menschen zu leblosen Objekten in der Natur, wie Steine oder Wasser, am einfachsten aufzubauen sowie zu halten sind und dadurch den Stress lindern können. Bezüglich der Pflanzenwahl eignen sich, hinsichtlich des ökologischen und therapeutischen Aspekts, einheimische Pflanzen, welche die Klientel im Therapiegarten über die fünf Hauptsinne wahrnehmen können. Dabei sind Pflanzen zur visuellen und olfaktorischen Wahrnehmung sowie zur zeitlichen Orientierung in der Gartentherapie besonders unterstützend.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stress is one of the main causes of mental illness. Stress related diseases, such as depression, are among the most common diseases worldwide, including Switzerland. For this reason, innovative solutions are needed to help treating people with stress-related diseases. Various studies have shown a positive effect of nature on health. Therapeutic gardens contribute to the success of treatment by combining the positive effect of nature on the human body with a space for therapy in a protected setting. In this work the planning requirements for therapeutic gardens for people with stress-related ill-nesses were developed.

An internet search was carried out to determine if therapeutic gardens for people with a mental disorder already exist in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein. In the Psychiatrische Dienste Aargau AG (PDAG) as well as the private clinic Clinicum Alpinum, which specializes in depression, therapeutic gardens exist already. Both gardens were examined to analyze how they are included in the treatment of patients. It was found that the therapy garden of the PDAG was designed as part of the clinic's occupational therapy. The Clinicum Alpinum, however, mainly uses its surroundings as a place of therapy and focuses more on the positive effects of nature itself. In order to evaluate how garden therapy is implemented at PDAG two of its garden therapists have been interviewed. To discuss the therapeutic goals for people with stress-related diseases and to analyze how a therapy garden can support the treatment an additional expert interview with a psychologist from the Lucerne Psychiatric Clinic has been conducted. Based on a literature research and the interviews, rooms and places which are particularly supportive for persons with stress-related diseases during rehabilitation have been defined. Additionally, it has been determined which plants and elements should be used in a therapeutic garden. It was found that remote and safe rooms with a focus on wild nature and a large floristic and faunistic biodiversity are particularly preferred by persons with a stress-related disease. Furthermore, simple, stable and beautiful objects should be available in a therapy garden. Relationships between people and inanimate objects in nature, such as stones or water, are the easiest to build and maintain and can therefore relieve stress. Plants, which clients can perceive in the therapeutic garden through the five main senses, are most suitable. Particularly supportive in garden therapy are plants for visual and olfactory perception as well as for temporal orientation.","doc_id":9417,"prior":"mental disorder","SDG3":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22842","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Planerische Anforderungen an Therapiegärten für Menschen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen","authors":"Werder, Marc","subject":"Therapiegarten; Gartentherapie; Natur; Stress; Stressfolgeerkrankung; Psychotherapie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615, 635","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Planerische Anforderungen an Therapiegärten für Menschen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen; Therapiegarten; Gartentherapie; Natur; Stress; Stressfolgeerkrankung; Psychotherapie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau); Gemäss der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) gilt Stress als eine der Hauptursachen für psychische Krankheiten.

Therapiegärten tragen zum Behandlungserfolg bei, indem sie den positiven Effekt der Natur auf den menschlichen Körper mit einem Raum für Therapien und Aktivitäten in einem geschützten Rahmen verbinden. In dieser Arbeit wurden die planerischen Anforderungen an Therapiegärten für Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen erarbeitet und beschrieben, wie das Medium Garten den Heilungsprozess unterstützen kann. Dazu wurde mittels einer Internetrecherche untersucht, ob in der Schweiz sowie in Liechtenstein bereits Therapiegärten für Personen mit einer psychischen Störung existieren. Dabei konnte ein Therapiegarten der Psychiatrische Dienste Aargau AG (PDAG) sowie ein «Alpengarten», der auf Depression spezialisierten Privatklinik Clinicum Alpinum, eruiert werden. Beide Gärten wurden untersucht und analysiert, wie diese in die Behandlung der Klientel miteinbezogen werden. Es konnte herausgefunden werden, dass der Therapiegarten der PDAG als Teil der Arbeitstherapie der Klinik gestaltet wurde und die Clinicum Alpinum vermehrt die Umgebung, als den Garten, als Therapieort nutzte. Mittels zweier Fachpersoneninterviews, mit dem Gartentherapeuten und der Gartentherapeutin der PDAG sowie einer Psychologin der Luzerner Psychiatrie, wurde mit ersteren die Durchführung der Gartentherapie an der PDAG eruiert und mit letzterer die therapeutischen Ziele bei Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen besprochen und analysiert, wie ein Therapiegarten die Behandlung unterstützen kann. Aufgrund einer Literaturrecherche sowie den Interviews wurden Räume und Orte definiert, die für Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen während der Rehabilitation besonders unterstützend sind und welche Pflanzen und Elemente in einem Therapiegarten eingesetzt werden sollten. Dabei wurde festgestellt, dass abgelegene und sichere Räume mit dem Fokus auf die wilde Natur sowie einer grossen floristischen und faunistischen Artenvielfalt von Personen mit einer Stressfolgeerkrankung besonders präferiert werden. Weiter sollten simple, stabile und schöne Objekte in einem Therapiegarten vorhanden sein, da Beziehungen von Menschen zu leblosen Objekten in der Natur, wie Steine oder Wasser, am einfachsten aufzubauen sowie zu halten sind und dadurch den Stress lindern können. Bezüglich der Pflanzenwahl eignen sich, hinsichtlich des ökologischen und therapeutischen Aspekts, einheimische Pflanzen, welche die Klientel im Therapiegarten über die fünf Hauptsinne wahrnehmen können. Dabei sind Pflanzen zur visuellen und olfaktorischen Wahrnehmung sowie zur zeitlichen Orientierung in der Gartentherapie besonders unterstützend.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stress is one of the main causes of mental illness. Stress related diseases, such as depression, are among the most common diseases worldwide, including Switzerland. For this reason, innovative solutions are needed to help treating people with stress-related diseases. Various studies have shown a positive effect of nature on health. Therapeutic gardens contribute to the success of treatment by combining the positive effect of nature on the human body with a space for therapy in a protected setting. In this work the planning requirements for therapeutic gardens for people with stress-related ill-nesses were developed. Furthermore, this work describes how the medium garden can support the healing process. An internet search was carried out to determine if therapeutic gardens for people with a mental disorder already exist in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein. In the Psychiatrische Dienste Aargau AG (PDAG) as well as the private clinic Clinicum Alpinum, which specializes in depression, therapeutic gardens exist already. Both gardens were examined to analyze how they are included in the treatment of patients. It was found that the therapy garden of the PDAG was designed as part of the clinic's occupational therapy. The Clinicum Alpinum, however, mainly uses its surroundings as a place of therapy and focuses more on the positive effects of nature itself. In order to evaluate how garden therapy is implemented at PDAG two of its garden therapists have been interviewed. To discuss the therapeutic goals for people with stress-related diseases and to analyze how a therapy garden can support the treatment an additional expert interview with a psychologist from the Lucerne Psychiatric Clinic has been conducted. Based on a literature research and the interviews, rooms and places which are particularly supportive for persons with stress-related diseases during rehabilitation have been defined. Additionally, it has been determined which plants and elements should be used in a therapeutic garden. It was found that remote and safe rooms with a focus on wild nature and a large floristic and faunistic biodiversity are particularly preferred by persons with a stress-related disease. Furthermore, simple, stable and beautiful objects should be available in a therapy garden. Relationships between people and inanimate objects in nature, such as stones or water, are the easiest to build and maintain and can therefore relieve stress. Plants, which clients can perceive in the therapeutic garden through the five main senses, are most suitable. Particularly supportive in garden therapy are plants for visual and olfactory perception as well as for temporal orientation.","doc_id":9417,"prior":"disease","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13196","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Impact of introducing a DRG reimbursement system in an acute impatient hostpital setting : a literature review","authors":"Brügger, Urs; Eichler, Klaus","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"362","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Impact of introducing a DRG reimbursement system in an acute impatient hostpital setting : a literature review;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Background: Diagnosis related groups (DRG) are a reimbursement system used by hospitals in an increasing number of countries.

In specific, it is shown that basic concepts of research in information texts represent particular obstacles to comprehensibility. These basic concepts are highly frequent in information texts regarding participation in human research, and a lack of prior knowledge about these concepts can hardly be established textually. As a solution, this contribution focuses on a rarely considered part of expert-layperson communication: the layperson’s use of specialized vocabulary. The layperson's use of specialized vocabulary is introduced as a distinct variable and compared to the expert's use. An analysis of interactions in internet forums shows that laypeople have their own practices in using specialized vocabulary. To make information texts more comprehensible, we argue for replacing expert specialized vocabulary in favor of those variables that are closer to laypersons' everyday life. Finally, we present a digital dictionary of specialized variables that aims to show both expert and layperson variables of specialized vocabulary and to make them productive for information practice.","doc_id":9667,"prior":"Gesundheitskommunikation","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"88","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23890","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Decomposition of outpatient health care spending by disease : a novel approach using insurance claims data","authors":"Stucki, Michael; Nemitz, Janina; Trottmann, Maria; Wieser, Simon","subject":"Cost-of-illness; Healthcare cost; Outpatient care; Spending decomposition;  Soziale Probleme und Sozialversicherungen;  Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"360, 362.1041","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Decomposition of outpatient health care spending by disease : a novel approach using insurance claims data; Cost-of-illness; Healthcare cost; Outpatient care; Spending decomposition;  Soziale Probleme und Sozialversicherungen;  Gesundheitsökonomie; Background: Decomposing health care spending by disease, type of care, age, and sex can lead to a better understanding of the drivers of health care spending. But the lack of diagnostic coding in outpatient care often precludes a decomposition by disease. Yet, health insurance claims data hold a variety of diagnostic clues that may be used to identify diseases.Methods: In this study, we decompose total outpatient care spending in Switzerland by age, sex, service type, and  exhaustive and mutually exclusive diseases according to the Global Burden of Disease classification. Using data of a large health insurance provider, we identify diseases based on diagnostic clues. These clues include type of medication, inpatient treatment, physician specialization, and disease specific outpatient treatments and examinations. We determine disease-specific spending by direct (clues-based) and indirect (regression-based) spending assignment.Results: Our results suggest a high precision of disease identification for many diseases. Overall, % of outpatient spending can be assigned to diseases, mostly based on indirect assignment using regression. Outpatient spending is highest for musculoskeletal disorders (.%), followed by mental and substance use disorders (.%), sense organ diseases (.%) and cardiovascular diseases (.%). Neoplasms account for .% of outpatient spending.Conclusions: Our study shows the potential of health insurance claims data in identifying diseases when no diagnostic coding is available. These disease-specific spending estimates may inform Swiss health policies in cost containment and priority setting.","doc_id":9669,"prior":"cardiovascular diseases","SDG3":1},{"id":"100","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/228","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Die Familie eines an Krebs erkrankten Kindes und ihre Betätigung","authors":"Lauper, Davina Manuela; Peter, Fabienne Susanne","subject":"neoplasms; child; family; occupational therapy; qualitative studies;  Ergotherapie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.8515","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Die Familie eines an Krebs erkrankten Kindes und ihre Betätigung; neoplasms; child; family; occupational therapy; qualitative studies;  Ergotherapie; Hintergrund: Die Krebsdiagnose eines Kindes beeinflusst sein Leben stark.

These lead to supportive care needs in some patients, while others are more able to cope with these consequences themselves. To be able to address these needs, it is important to identify patients' needs at the time they arise.Methods: Women (n = ) with newly-diagnosed breast cancer, under treatment in two Swiss breast cancer clinics, participated in a cross-sectional survey. Standardized instruments were used: Supportive Care Needs Survey, Cancer- and Cancer Treatment-related Symptom Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer, and Interpersonal Relationship Inventory.Results: The patients' most needed help with psychological issues. Many had treatment-related symptoms like fatigue (.%), hot flashes (.%), and a changed body appearance (.%). The majority suffered from distress (.%), fewer from anxiety (.%) and depression (.%). Physical and social impairment, impaired body image, distress, anxiety and depression, a lack of social support and conflicts in their personal relationships were associated with supportive care needs.Conclusions: The findings can help to identify more vulnerable patients with unmet needs and a higher demand for support. Assessment of patients enables health care professionals to provide support and counselling. In these assessments, the patients' relationship to close relatives should also be addressed.","doc_id":9760,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22778","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Inclusion of majority : discoursive dynamics of responsibility during the COVID-19 pandemic","authors":"Krasselt, Julia; Dreesen, Philipp","subject":"Transdisciplinary; Public health communication; Discourse analysis; Corpus linguistics; Vector population; Triangulation;  Kommunikation;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"302.2, 362","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Inclusion of majority : discoursive dynamics of responsibility during the COVID- pandemic; Transdisciplinary; Public health communication; Discourse analysis; Corpus linguistics; Vector population; Triangulation;  Kommunikation;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Protecting and ensuring the health of weaker and vulnerable members of the society is one guiding ethical principle during the COVID- pandemic.

Private donors such as foundations and corporations are playing an increasingly important role, working in international development as direct operators or in partnerships with governments. This study compares maternal health programs of new development actors to traditional governmental donors. It aims to investigate what maternal health programs large governmental donors, foundations and corporate donors are conducting, and how and why they differ.Methods: A total of  projects were identified and analyzed. We focus on nine categories of maternal health programs: family planning services, focus on specific diseases, focus on capacity building, use of information and communication technology (ICT), support of research initiatives, cooperation with local non-state or state partners and cooperation with non-local non-state or state partners. Data analysis was carried out using Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMER).Results: Maternal health policies of public and private donors differ with regard to strategic approaches, as can be seen in their diverging positions regarding disease focus, family planning services, capacity building, and partner choice. Bilateral donors can be characterized as focusing on family planning services, specific diseases and capacity-building while disregarding research and ICT. Bilateral donors cooperate with local public authorities and with governments and NGOs from other developed countries. In contrast, corporations focus their donor activities on specific diseases, capacity-building and ICT while disregarding family planning services and research. Corporations cooperate with local and in particular with non-local non-state actors. Foundations can be characterized as focusing on family planning services and research, while disregarding specific diseases, capacity-building and ICT. Foundations cooperate less than other donors; but when they do, they cooperate in particular with non-state actors, local as well as non-local.Conclusions: These findings should help developing coordination mechanisms that embrace the differences and similarities of the different types of donors. As donor groups specialize in different contexts, NGOs and governments working on development and health aid may target donors groups that have specialized in certain issues.","doc_id":9830,"prior":"maternal health","SDG3":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11979","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Über die Wirkung von Sozialberatung auf die Lebensqualität und Belastungsbewältigung von Eltern mit einem krebskranken Kind : Einblicke in ein laufendes Forschungsprojekt","authors":"Haunberger, Sigrid; Rüegger, Cornelia; Baumgartner, Edgar","subject":" Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"361","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Über die Wirkung von Sozialberatung auf die Lebensqualität und Belastungsbewältigung von Eltern mit einem krebskranken Kind : Einblicke in ein laufendes Forschungsprojekt;  Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe; Kindliche Krebserkrankungen führen häufig zu akuten psychosozialen Belastungen für das Kind selbst wie auch für die gesamte Familie.

Thus, the article emphasizes that their experiences of alcohol (non) consumption create options that are distributed, corporeal and accountable.

Dose verification was performed and colony formation assays were carried out. To compare the predictability of our data, radiobiological models were included.Results: The results presented here demonstrate that irradiation of glioblastoma cell lines using the FFF beam is more efficient in reducing clonogenic cell survival than the standard flattened beam, an effect which becomes more significant the higher the single dose. Interestingly, in our experimental setting, the radiobiological effect of the FFF beam is dependent on dose per pulse rather than on delivery time. The used radiobiological models are able to describe the observed dose rate dependency between  and  Gy/min.Conclusion: The results presented here show that dose per pulse might become a crucial factor which influences cancer cell survival. Using high dose rates, currently used radiobiological models as well as molecular mechanisms involved urgently need to be re-examined.","doc_id":9930,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17602","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Leg and back muscle activity, heart rate, performance and comfort during sitting, standing, and using a sit-stand-support with different seat angles","authors":"Nicoletti, Corinne; Läubli, Thomas","subject":"Muscle activity; Sit-stand-support; Sitting;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Leg and back muscle activity, heart rate, performance and comfort during sitting, standing, and using a sit-stand-support with different seat angles; Muscle activity; Sit-stand-support; Sitting;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Long-lasting sitting and standing is related to several health risks and alternatives to these positions are needed.

However, there are not enough trained specialists yet to build and operate such systems. The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of institutions of higher education – like ZHAW – can play to mitigate this deficit. ZHAW has the ability to execute applied research, teaching on BSc and MSc level, and is aiming to increase societal added value concerning education and health. Each of these levels has different demands on the aquaponic system concerning a multitude of factors, such as access, size, construction, climate control, diversity of production methods, recycling and closed loop systems, provision of energy from renewable sources and rainwater harvesting, treatment and use. To evaluate how these objectives are reached, the requirements on the system originating from each level are defined. These are used to evaluate the aquaponic system that was built and operated at ZHAW. Other aquaponic systems in use are compared to the ZHAW system, using the same evaluation criteria. The results show that the ZHAW Aquaponics Lab can reach all target levels, if the aquaponic farm of its spin-off company UrbanFarmers is viewed as an extension of it.","doc_id":10061,"prior":"health","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12828","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Impact evaluation of Swiss Medical Board reports on routine care in Switzerland : a case study of PSA screening and treatment for rupture of anterior cruciate ligament","authors":"Eichler, Klaus; Hess, Sascha; Riguzzi, Marco; Can, Ünal; Brügger, Urs","subject":"Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament repair; Evidence-Based Medicine; Impact evaluation; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Swiss Medical Board;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Impact evaluation of Swiss Medical Board reports on routine care in Switzerland : a case study of PSA screening and treatment for rupture of anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament repair; Evidence-Based Medicine; Impact evaluation; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Swiss Medical Board;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Questions under Study: Evidence-based recommendations play an important role in medical decision-making, but barriers to adherence are common. In Switzerland, the Swiss Medical Board (SMB) publishes evidence reports that conclude with recommendations. We assessed the impact of two SMB reports on service provision (: Recommendation of conservative treatment as first option for rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee; : Recommendation against PSA screening for prostate cancer).Methods: We performed an observational study and assessed quantitative data over time via interrupted times series analyses. The primary outcome was the quarterly number of performed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests and the annual rates of surgical ACL repair in patients with ACL rupture. Data were adjusted for time trends and relevant confounders. Results: We analysed PSA tests in , outpatients from - and treatment data in , patients with knee injury from -. For the number of PSA tests, the secular trend before the intervention showed a continuous but diminishing increase over time. A statistically significant reduction in tests was estimated immediately after the intervention, but a later return to the trend before the intervention cannot be ruled out. The rate of surgical ACL repair had already declined after the late s to about % in . No relevant additional change emerged in this secular trend after the intervention.Conclusions: Despite some evidence of a possible change, we did not find a sustained and significant impact of SMB recommendations in our case study. Further monitoring is needed to confirm or refute these findings.","doc_id":10062,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23711","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Ausgrenzung unter Ausgegrenzten","authors":"Leite de Araújo, Erilene; Herzig, Michael","subject":"Marginalisierung; Norbert Elias; Sozialarbeit; Alkoholismus;  Soziale Interaktion","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"302","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Ausgrenzung unter Ausgegrenzten; Marginalisierung; Norbert Elias; Sozialarbeit; Alkoholismus;  Soziale Interaktion; Wer neu zu einer Gruppe stösst, muss sich beweisen.

Higher levels of trust in personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies have been previously related to lower levels of emotional exhaustion, yet little is known on how to achieve such a perception of safety. We thus sought to identify institutional actions, strategies and policies related to HCWs’ safety perception during the early phase of the pandemic at a tertiary care center in Switzerland by interviewing HCWs from different clinics, professions, and positions.Methods: For this qualitative study,  face-to-face semi-structured interviews were performed. Interviews were based on a guide that addressed the perception of institutional strategies and policies during the first phase of the pandemic in March . The participants included doctors (n = ) and nurses (n = ) in senior and non-senior positions from eight clinics in the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, all involved in patient care. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and organized using MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH, Berlin).Findings: Five recurring themes were identified to affect HCWs’ perception of their safety during the SARS-CoV- pandemic: () transparency and clarity of information, () communication on the availability of PPE (with the provision of information alone increasing the feeling of safety even if supplies of PPE were reported as low), () uniformity and consistency of guidelines, () digital resources to support face-to-face teaching (although personal information transfer is still being considered superior in terms of strengthening safety perception) and () support and appreciation for the work performed.Conclusions: This study identifies institutional policies and actions influencing HCWs’ safety perception during the first wave of the COVID- pandemic, the most important of which is the factor of transparent communication. This knowledge reveals potential areas of action critical to improving preparedness and management in hospitals faced with an infectious disease threat.","doc_id":10167,"prior":"infectious disease","SDG3":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18163","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Reply to the letter to the editor : “newer-generation antidepressants and suicide risk : thoughts on Hengartner and Plöderl’s re-analysis”","authors":"Hengartner, Michael Pascal; Plöderl, Martin","subject":" Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Reply to the letter to the editor : “newer-generation antidepressants and suicide risk : thoughts on Hengartner and Plöderl’s re-analysis”;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","doc_id":10199,"prior":"suicide","SDG3":1},{"id":"84","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8400","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Evaluating intervention using time aids in children with disabilities","authors":"Janeslätt, Gunnel; Kottorp, Anders Börje Mauritz; Granlund, Mats","subject":"Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; Cerebral palsy; Intellectual disability; Spinal dysraphism; Time perception; Self-help device; Time management;  Ergotherapie;  Pädiatrie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615.8515, 618.92","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Evaluating intervention using time aids in children with disabilities; Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; Cerebral palsy; Intellectual disability; Spinal dysraphism; Time perception; Self-help device; Time management;  Ergotherapie;  Pädiatrie; Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate complex intervention using time aids for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities who exhibit limitations in daily time management.

The aim of our research is to assess the prevalence and treatment costs of asthma and COPD in Switzerland based on a variety of data sources. Methods: Our analysis was mainly based on claims data provided by Helsana, a large health insurer, and on the Swiss Health Survey (SHS), a large and representative population survey. Individuals with asthma and COPD were identified based on the type of drugs purchased. Information on inpatient diagnosis, medical procedures and laboratory examinations were also used to improve the identification. Drug combinations derived from the GINA and GOLD guidelines were used to distinguish asthma from COPD and classify diseases by severity. Costs were assessed by degree of severity.

Knowledge of factors that are associated with women's decision-making around mode of birth after CS is important when developing strategies to promote VBAC. This study assessed which factors are associated with women's preferences for VBAC versus elective repeat caesarean section (ERCS) in a new pregnancy after one previous caesarean in Switzerland.Design: Cross-sectional web-survey.Setting: Western Switzerland.Participants: French-speaking women living in Western Switzerland, with one previous CS who gave birth subsequently to a child after a complication-free pregnancy were eligible to participate in the survey.

Analyses were performed with SPSS  and Stata .Findings: Of the women planning a VBAC, .% VBAC gave birth vaginally. Predictors which were significantly associated with increased odds of women choosing a VBAC: duration since previous birth in years (OR=. % CI [.-.], p=.), having had midwifery care during pregnancy (OR=., % CI [.-.], p=.), being advised by their healthcare provider to attempt a VBAC (OR=., % CI [.-.], p=.), preference for VBAC during the third trimester of their pregnancy (OR=., % CI [.-.], p=.), and wishing to let the child choose the moment of birth (OR=., % CI[.-.], p Conclusion: caregivers’ recommendations about mode of birth after CS, women's preferences during the third trimester and midwifery care during pregnancy were found to be the most important predictors for preferring a VBAC at term.

Its complexity on the cognitive as well as on the structural level makes neuroscience a challenging venture. Since the introduction of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) a decade ago, progress has been made in the non-invasive depiction of the neuronal organization. DTI allows to probe the tissue micro structure by characterizing the local mobility of water molecules in all three spatial dimensions. As an auspicious application, the so-called fiber tractography technique connects tiny, virtual brain segments in direction of the main diffusion, representing axonal pathways in three dimensions. The key problems of DTI consist in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the poor image quality: As it is sensitive to motion, the underlying diffusion-weighted images are preferably acquired from a single radio frequency excitation. Single-shot experiments suffer from an increased susceptibility to magnetic field inhomogeneities, leading to image distortions, and a restricted spatial resolution due to spin relaxation processes. The limited image quality affects also the performance of reconstructing fiber trajectories. Misleading pathways may result. The present dissertation is dedicated to the development of new concepts for improving DTI and fiber tracking. With the advent of the parallel imaging technique SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) and the initiation of high-field magnets, major advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging have been achieved. A focus of the presented work is the implementation and investigation of SENSE-DTI at a high magnetic field strength. It is shown that the application of SENSE at  Tesla exploits the increased SNR of the main magnetic field while diminishing artifacts based on susceptibility variations. As a result of the reduced number of spatial encoding steps, the point spread function narrows, thus yielding data with an enhanced intrinsic spatial resolution.

Two psychosis syndromes, derived from the SCL--R, were applied: ‘schizotypal signs’ and ‘schizophrenia nuclear symptoms’.Results: Only a few subjects (.%) reported no schizotypal signs. While .% of subjects indicated mild signs, only a small proportion (.%) reported severe signs. A very common outcome was no ‘schizophrenia nuclear symptoms’ (.%). Although .% of the participants reported mild symptoms, severe nuclear symptoms were very rare (.%). Because these two syndromes were only moderately correlated (r = .), we were able to establish sufficiently distinct symptom clusters. Schizotypal signs were more closely connected to distress than was schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, even though their distribution types were similar. Both syndromes were associated with several covariates, such as alcohol and tobacco use, being unmarried, low education level, psychopathological distress and low subjective well-being.Conclusions: Subclinical psychosis symptoms are quite frequent in the general population but, for the most part, are not very pronounced. In particular, our data support the notion of a continuous Wald distribution of psychotic symptoms in the general population. Our findings have enabled us to confirm the usefulness of these syndromes as previously assessed in other independent community samples.

Continuous management monitors application and infrastructural metrics to provide automated and responsive reactions to failures (health management) and changing environmental conditions (auto-scaling) minimizing human intervention.In the current practice, management functionalities are provided as infrastructural or third party services. In both cases they are external to the application deployment. We claim that this approach has intrinsic limits, namely that separating management functionalities from the application prevents them from naturally scaling with the application and requires additional management code and human intervention. Moreover, using infrastructure provider services for management functionalities results in vendor lock-in effectively preventing cloud applications to adapt and run on the most effective cloud for the job.In this paper we discuss the main characteristics of cloud native applications, propose a novel architecture that enables scalable and resilient self-managing applications in the cloud, and relate on our experience in porting a legacy application to the cloud applying cloud-native principles.","doc_id":11280,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"8","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14464","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Physiotherapy research priorities in Switzerland : views of the various stakeholders","authors":"Nast, Irina; Tal, Amir; Schmidt, Stefan; Schoeb, Veronika; Rau, Barbara; Barbero, Marco; Kool, Jan","subject":"Delphi technique; Physiotherapy; Research priorities; Focus Groups; Health Planning; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Organizational Innovation; Physical Therapists; Physical Therapy Modalities; Policy Making; Qualitative Research; Switzerland; Total Quality Management;  Physiotherapie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615.82","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Physiotherapy research priorities in Switzerland : views of the various stakeholders; Delphi technique; Physiotherapy; Research priorities; Focus Groups; Health Planning; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Organizational Innovation; Physical Therapists; Physical Therapy Modalities; Policy Making; Qualitative Research; Switzerland; Total Quality Management;  Physiotherapie; Background and purpose: Research priorities, defined by multiple stakeholders, can proximally facilitate the coordination of research projects and national and international cooperation and distally further improve the quality of physiotherapy practice. The aim of this study was therefore to establish physiotherapy research priorities in Switzerland considering multiple stakeholders' opinions.Methods: A mixed methods design was chosen. For a qualitative identification of physiotherapy research topics,  focus group discussions and  semi‐structured interviews/written commentaries were conducted. For the quantitative analysis,  participants prioritized research topics using a two‐round Delphi questionnaire survey. The following stakeholder groups were surveyed in the German‐speaking, French‐speaking and Italian‐speaking regions of Switzerland: physiotherapy researchers, practitioners and educators, representatives of patient organizations, public health organizations, health insurers, physicians, nurses, occupational therapists and other health professionals, as well as physical educators.Results: The top five overall physiotherapy research priorities identified were as follows: physiotherapy treatment, physiotherapy assessment and diagnosis, prevention, physiotherapist–patient interaction and physiotherapy professional education at the bachelor level. With regard to diagnostic groups, the highest priorities were placed on musculoskeletal disorders, neurology, orthopaedics, geriatrics and ergonomics/occupational health. Consensus was moderate to high, and only few differences between stakeholder groups were revealed.Discussion: Research directly related to physiotherapy treatment is of highest priority. It should focus on diagnostic groups related to chronicity in anticipation of demographic changes. Multidisciplinary networks for research and practice, alongside sound coordination of research projects, should increase the impact of physiotherapy research. An accurate dissemination of research priorities, defined and supported by multiple stakeholder groups, might strengthen their impact on research and practice.","doc_id":11288,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16550","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Jugendliche als Opfer und Täter von Gewalt","authors":"Baier, Dirk; Kliem, Sören","subject":"Gewalt; Psychische Gesundheit; Trendentwicklung; Trend; Violence; Mental health;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Kriminologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362, 364","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Jugendliche als Opfer und Täter von Gewalt; Gewalt; Psychische Gesundheit; Trendentwicklung; Trend; Violence; Mental health;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Kriminologie; Im Beitrag werden Befunde zur Verbreitung und Entwicklung der Jugendgewalt vorgestellt.

Die betagten, gebrechlichen Menschen leiden häufig an körperlichen Einbußen, wie Mobilitätseinschränkungen (Wingenfeld & Schnabel, ), und gerontopsychiatrischen Erkrankungen, wie demenzielle Erkrankungen (Schneekloth & Wahl, ). Auch ist eine immer kürzere Lebensdauer nach dem Einzug, % der Bewohner versterben in den ersten sechs Monaten im Heim (Schneekloth. ), zu beobachten. Mit der zentralen Forschungsfrage nach dem Erleben der Bewohner während des Einzugs in ein Heim sollte herausgefunden werden, mit welchen Sorgen und Nöten diese Menschen konfrontiert sind. Das Ziel bestand darin, die Bedeutung dieser Erfahrungen zu explorieren. Die Auswertung der Daten erfolgte mittels interpretierender Phänomenologie (Benner, ). Es wurden insgesamt  Interviews mit Bewohnern und von ihnen benannten Angehörigen geführt. Die Studie brachte zum Ausdruck, dass erstens die Bewohner Einsicht dafür zeigten, dass die Versorgung im Pflegeheim notwendig wurde. Die Bewohner suchten einen Platz im Pflegeheim, damit ihre körperliche Versorgung gewährleistet war. An ihrem Person-Sein änderte ihr Abhängig-Sein nichts. Zweitens zeigte der Alltag im Heim den Bewohnern, dass ihr Abhängig-Sein viel weiter ging, als sie vor dem Einzug dachten. Das Warten auf Hilfe und das Zurechtkommen mit den zur Verfügung stehenden Hilfsmitteln waren belastend. Drittens waren für die Bewohner Personen aus ihrem persönlichen Umfeld zum Erleben von sozialer Integration relevant. Ob Schwester, Ehemann oder Kinder, die Beziehung zu diesen Familienmitgliedern war für das Wohlbefinden der Bewohner ein zentrales Kriterium. Die Ergebnisse unterstreichen die Notwendigkeit einer Erweiterung des Pflegebedürftigkeitsbegriffs in der sozialen Pflegeversicherung. Sie zeigen aber auch, dass die Art, der Umfang und der Inhalt der Befunderhebung durch die Pflegenden nicht ausreichen, um den Bewohner ressourcengerecht in seinem Alltagsgeschehen im Heim zu unterstützen.Life in a nursing home is a reality that can not be denied in our society (Schneekloth, ). Aged, fragile persons often suffer from physical impairments, such as loss of mobility (Wingenfeld & Schnabel, ) and gerontopsychiatric illnesses such as dementia (Schneekloth & Wahl, ). Decreasing lifeexpectancy after moving into the facility can be documented; % of the residents die within the first six months after moving into the home (Schneekloth, ). This study’s central question was to determine what the residents experience in this transition and to find out what their worries and difficulties are. The goal was to explore the meaning of these experiences for them. The analysis of the data was carried out using the methodology of interpretive phenomenology (Benner, ). Fiftyfive () interviews with residents and a relative of their choice were conducted. Firstly, the research revealed that the residents showed understanding for the necessity of care in the home. The residents came to the home so that their physical needs could be met. Their sense of personal identity was not altered by being dependent on help.Secondly, the daily routine of the home revealed to the residents that they were much more dependant than they had thought before moving in. Waiting for assistance and coping with the available health aids was a strain. Thirdly, maintaining contact with family (or friends) was important to the residents’ social integration in the new environment. Whether the person was a sister, husband, or children, the relationship to these family members was a central factor in their sense of wellbeing. These results underscore the necessity of broadening the definition of nursing care dependency in longterm nursing care insurance. The results also show that the manner and scope of nursing assessment in the homes is not adequate for supporting the residents appropriately in the daily routine of life in the home.","doc_id":11558,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13305","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Integration von Personen mit einer Persönlichkeitsstörung in den Arbeitsmarkt : worauf sollte in der Beratung und Begleitung sowie in der Eingliederung in den Arbeitsmarkt geachtet werden?","authors":"Wenk, Martina","subject":" Arbeitsökonomie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"331, 616.8","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Integration von Personen mit einer Persönlichkeitsstörung in den Arbeitsmarkt : worauf sollte in der Beratung und Begleitung sowie in der Eingliederung in den Arbeitsmarkt geachtet werden?;  Arbeitsökonomie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Für Jugendliche in der Schweiz ist es in den letzten Jahren schwieriger geworden den Zugang zu Arbeit und Beruf zu erhalten.

Das Hauptziel der vorliegenden Studie lag darin, das Fachwissen zur Eingliederung in den Arbeitsmarkt von Klienten mit einer Emotional instabilen Persönlichkeitsstörung oder einer Ängstlich (vermeidende) Persönlichkeitsstörung bei den behandelnden Psychiatern, Psychologen und den IV-Fachpersonen abzuholen und zu vereinen.Zur Befragung der vier Fachgruppen wurde ein teilstandardisierter Fragebogen eingesetzt und an Fachpersonen per Email versandt. Insgesamt wurden  Fragebögen durch externe Fachpersonen ausgefüllt zurück gesendet. Von den internen Mitarbeitern erhielt die Studienleiterin  ausgefüllte Fragebögen zurück. Die Ergebnisse weisen unter anderem darauf hin, dass externe Fachpersonen Arbeitgeber zurückhaltender über die Auswirkungen der Störungen informieren würden als IV-Mitarbeiter und weniger Einschränkungen bei der Berufswahl äussern.

In recent years, researchers across disciplines of psychology have focused attention on the impact of the retirement process on post-retirement adjustment and well-being. The objective of the current review is twofold. The first goal is to review the literature on retirement planning with attention to past conceptualizations and current theoretical specifications. Second, empirical work investigating the psychological antecedents of retirement planning is reviewed. The primary conclusion reached from this review is that, conceptually, retirement planning continues to be poorly delineated and, thereby, narrowly investigated. Empirically, cognitive antecedents of retirement planning continue to figure prominently in both workplace and retirement researches. The boundary conditions of retirement planning, as well as alternative mechanisms for adult well-being, are discussed. Specifically, retirement planning's meaning amidst increasing job mobility and longer life expectancies are identified as two complementary areas for future empirical integration of work-retirement research domains.","doc_id":11816,"prior":"life expectancies","SDG3":1},{"id":"76","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21634","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Medication use by CAM users and non-users : a Swiss cross-sectional survey","authors":"Simões-Wüst, Ana Paula; Rist, Lukas; Dettling, Marcel","subject":" Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Medication use by CAM users and non-users : a Swiss cross-sectional survey;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is very popular in Switzerland.

We analyzed the data collected from a -year community sample during seven measuring occasions, beginning in . In the last assessment (), we included for the first time the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Making the diagnosis of a lifetime mental disorder a predictor for burnout required us to compile the cumulative prevalence rate over all seven occasions. We also evaluated various psycho-social predictors of burnout over the life cycle of our sample. Concurrent associations of the MBI with subscales from the SCL--R were also investigated. The relationship of burnout with several SCL--R subscales demonstrated that, in all dimensions, burnout is associated with significant psychopathology. Persons with a lifetime mood disorder, and especially those with a combination of mood and anxiety disorders, had a higher risk for subsequent burnout. Various partnership problems were another predictor for burnout. In conclusion, the role of mental disorder as an occupational illness remains controversial. Various forms of such disorders as well as some psycho-social predictors can predispose to burnout. By contrast, work-related predictors appear to be less important.","doc_id":11880,"prior":"mental disorder","SDG3":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15290","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Von der Pflanze zur Arzneidroge : ein interaktives Ausstellungselement für den TCM-Arzneipflanzengarten","authors":"Plebani, Lorena","subject":"Arzneipflanzengarten; TCM (Traditionell Chinesische Medizin); Heilpflanzen; Kultur-/Naturinterpretation; Informationsvermittlung; Narrative Environments; Ausstellungsdidaktik; Umweltkommunikation;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"580","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Von der Pflanze zur Arzneidroge : ein interaktives Ausstellungselement für den TCM-Arzneipflanzengarten; Arzneipflanzengarten; TCM (Traditionell Chinesische Medizin); Heilpflanzen; Kultur-/Naturinterpretation; Informationsvermittlung; Narrative Environments; Ausstellungsdidaktik; Umweltkommunikation;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Das Wissen über Heilpflanzen ist in westlichen Kulturen weitgehend in Vergessenheit geraten.

Bacteriophages offer highly specific and effective biocontrol of such pathogens. We evaluated the broad host range, virulent phage FO-E for reduction of Salmonella Typhimurium in different RTE foods. Samples were spiked with ×³ Salmonella cells and treated with ×⁸ pfu/g phage, and incubated for  days at  °C or  °C. At  °C, no viable cells remained following FO-E application, corresponding to a more than  log₁₀ unit reduction. At  °C, application of phage lowered S. Typhimurium counts by  log units on turkey deli meat and in chocolate milk, and by  logs on hot dogs and in seafood. In egg yolk, an effect was observed only after  days, but not after  days. Phage particles retained their infectivity, although they were readily immobilized by the food matrix, resulting in loss of their ability to diffuse and infect target cells. At the end of the incubation period, phage-resistant Salmonella strains appeared which, however, were not able to compensate for the initial killing effect. Altogether, our data show that virulent phages such as FO-E offer an effective biocontrol measure for Salmonella in foods.","doc_id":11893,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18325","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Gesundheitsberatung für Cancer Survivors : ein Scoping Review","authors":"Eren, Ulas","subject":"Cancer survivors; Gesundheitsberatung; Health coaching; Verhaltensänderung; Selbstwirksamkeit; Social cognitive theory; Motivational interviewing;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"616","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Gesundheitsberatung für Cancer Survivors : ein Scoping Review; Cancer survivors; Gesundheitsberatung; Health coaching; Verhaltensänderung; Selbstwirksamkeit; Social cognitive theory; Motivational interviewing;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Thema: In der Schweiz leben mehr als ' Cancer Survivors.

Additionally, we were interested in the involvement of HSP in radiosensitization.MethodsRadiosensitization by hyperthermia was determined in a panel of human and canine cancer cell lines using clonogenic cell survival assay, as well as levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs) using immunoblotting. The influence of the hyperthermia-radiotherapy time gap, different temperatures and the order of treatments on clonogenicity of hyperthermia-sensitive A cells was investigated. Additionally, DNA damage and cell death were assessed by Comet assay and an apoptosis/necrosis assay. Further we induced transient knockdown in A cells to test HSP’s involvement in radiosensitization.ResultsOut of eight cell lines tested, only two (A and Abrams) showed significant decrease in clonogenic cell survival when pre-treated with hyperthermia at ˚C. Strong induction of HSP upon thermoradiotherapy (HT-RT) treatment was found in all cell lines. Transient knockdown of HSP in A cells did not result in decrease of clonogenic cell survival in response to HT-RT.ConclusionTumor cell-type, temperature and order of treatment play an important role in radiosensitization by hyperthermia. However, hyperthermia has limited potency to radiosensitize canine cancer cells grown in a D cell culture setting presented here. DNA damage and apoptosis/necrosis did not increase upon combined treatment and cytosolic levels of HSP appear not to play critical role in the radiosensitization of A cells.","doc_id":12118,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"10","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3288","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Cell-seeded thermoreversible hydrogel-polyurethane composites for nucleus pulposus augmentation","authors":"Striegl, Britta; Grad, S.; Eglin, D; Benneker, L.; Peroglio, M.; Alini, Mauro; Graf-Hausner, Ursula; Bono, Epifania","subject":" Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"610","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Cell-seeded thermoreversible hydrogel-polyurethane composites for nucleus pulposus augmentation;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Tissue engineering represents an alternative approach to the current invasive surgical procedures for the intervertebral disc (IVD) repair.

Conclusions: The main results are consistent with a protective effect of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, and nuts against age-related chronic respiratory disease. If confirmed in prospective cohorts, our results may guide nutritional counselling towards respiratory health promotion.","doc_id":12244,"prior":"chronic respiratory disease","SDG3":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8146","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Improving the organisation of maternal health service delivery and optimising childbirth by increasing vaginal birth after caesarean section through enhanced women-centred care (OptiBIRTH trial) : study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN10612254)","authors":"Clarke, Mike; Savage, Gerard; Smith, Valerie; Daly, Deirdre; Devane, Declan; Gross, Mechthild Maria; Grylka, Susanne; Healy, Patricia; Morano, Sandra; Nicoletti, Jane; Begley, Cecily","subject":"Clinical protocol; Cost saving; Cost-benefit analysis; Health care costs; Patient selection; Prospective studies; Research design; Treatment outcome; Delivery of health care; Maternal health services; Patient-centered care; Vaginal birth after cesarean;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Improving the organisation of maternal health service delivery and optimising childbirth by increasing vaginal birth after caesarean section through enhanced women-centred care (OptiBIRTH trial) : study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN); Clinical protocol; Cost saving; Cost-benefit analysis; Health care costs; Patient selection; Prospective studies; Research design; Treatment outcome; Delivery of health care; Maternal health services; Patient-centered care; Vaginal birth after cesarean;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: The proportion of pregnant women who have a caesarean section shows a wide variation across Europe, and concern exists that these proportions are increasing. Much of the increase in caesarean sections in recent years is due to a cascade effect in which a woman who has had one caesarean section is much more likely to have one again if she has another baby. In some places, it has become common practice for a woman who has had a caesarean section to have this procedure again as a matter of routine. The alternative, vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC), which has been widely recommended, results in fewer undesired results or complications and is the preferred option for most women. However, VBAC rates in some countries are much lower than in other countries.Methods/Design: The OptiBIRTH trial uses a cluster randomised design to test a specially developed approach to try to improve the VBAC rate. It will attempt to increase VBAC rates from  % to  % through increased women-centred care and women’s involvement in their care. Sixteen hospitals in Germany, Ireland and Italy agreed to join the study, and each hospital was randomly allocated to be either an intervention or a control site.Discussion: If the OptiBIRTH intervention succeeds in increasing VBAC rates, its application across Europe might avoid the , unnecessary caesarean sections that occur every year at an extra direct annual cost of more than € million.","doc_id":12285,"prior":"maternal health","SDG3":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23318","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"PrepNet : a convolutional auto-encoder to homogenize CT scans for cross-dataset medical image analysis","authors":"Amirian, Mohammadreza; Montoya, Javier; Gruss, Jonathan; Stebler, Yves D.; Bozkir, Ahmet Selman; Calandri, Marco; Schwenker, Friedhelm; Stadelmann, Thilo","subject":"Adaptive preprocessing; Domain adaptation; Autoencoder;  Biomedizin, Biomedizinische Technik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"610.28","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"PrepNet : a convolutional auto-encoder to homogenize CT scans for cross-dataset medical image analysis; Adaptive preprocessing; Domain adaptation; Autoencoder;  Biomedizin, Biomedizinische Technik; With the spread of COVID- over the world, the need arose for fast and precise automatic triage mechanisms to decelerate the spread of the disease by reducing human efforts e.g. for image-based diagnosis. Although the literature has shown promising efforts in this direction, reported results do not consider the variability of CT scans acquired under varying circumstances, thus rendering resulting models unfit for use on data acquired using e.g. different scanner technologies. While COVID- diagnosis can now be done efficiently using PCR tests, this use case exemplifies the need for a methodology to overcome data variability issues in order to make medical image analysis models more widely applicable. In this paper, we explicitly address the variability issue using the example of COVID- diagnosis and propose a novel generative approach that aims at erasing the differences induced by e.g. the imaging technology while simultaneously introducing minimal changes to the CT scans through leveraging the idea of deep autoencoders. The proposed prepossessing architecture (PrepNet) (i) is jointly trained on multiple CT scan datasets and (ii) is capable of extracting improved discriminative features for improved diagnosis. Experimental results on three public datasets (SARS-COVID-, UCSD COVID-CT, MosMed) show that our model improves cross-dataset generalization by up to : percentage points despite a minor drop in within dataset performance.","doc_id":12297,"prior":"disease","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5699","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Die Bedeutung von Schichtzugehörigkeit und sozialen Beziehungen für die Krankheitsverarbeitung : eine Untersuchung in drei soziokulturell unterschiedlichen Gruppen","authors":"Page, Julie","subject":"Krankheitsverarbeitung; Soziale Ungleichheit; HIV/AIDS; Soziale Beziehung;  Soziale Gruppen;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Dissertation","bid":"305, 610","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"Die Bedeutung von Schichtzugehörigkeit und sozialen Beziehungen für die Krankheitsverarbeitung : eine Untersuchung in drei soziokulturell unterschiedlichen Gruppen; Krankheitsverarbeitung; Soziale Ungleichheit; HIV/AIDS; Soziale Beziehung;  Soziale Gruppen;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Problem- und Fragestellung: Vor dem Hintergrund steigender Lebenserwartung und der damit verbundenen Zunahme an chronischen Erkrankungen ist das Forschungsinteresse an den Determinanten einer effektiven, also erfolgreichen Krankheitsverarbeitung gestiegen.

MNDs have severe health consequences and are particularly harmful during early childhood due to their impact on the physical and cognitive development. We estimate the costs of illness due to iron deficiency (IDA), vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and zinc deficiency (ZnD) in  age groups (- and - months) of Filipino children by socio-economic strata in .Methods: We build a health economic model simulating the consequences of MNDs in childhood over the entire lifetime. The model is based on a health survey and a nutrition survey carried out in . The sample populations are first structured into  socio-economic strata (SES) and  age groups. Health consequences of MNDs are modelled based on information extracted from literature. Direct medical costs, production losses and intangible costs are computed and long term costs are discounted to present value.Results: Total lifetime costs of IDA, VAD and ZnD amounted to direct medical costs of  million dollars, production losses of  million dollars and intangible costs of , disability adjusted life years (DALYs). These costs can be interpreted as the lifetime costs of a -year cohort affected by MNDs between the age of – months. Direct medical costs are dominated by costs due to ZnD (% of total), production losses by losses in future lifetime (% of total) and intangible costs by premature death (% of total DALY losses) and losses in future lifetime (%). Costs of MNDs differ considerably between SES as costs in the poorest third of the households are  times higher than in the wealthiest third.Conclusions: MNDs lead to substantial costs in --month-old children in the Philippines. Costs are highly concentrated in the lower SES and in children - months old. These results may have important implications for the design, evaluation and choice of the most effective and cost-effective policies aimed at the reduction of MNDs.","doc_id":12352,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14646","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Die Schweiz zahlt hohen Preis für nicht-übertragbare Krankheiten : gesundheitsökonomische Studie identifiziert die teuersten Krankheiten der Schweiz","authors":"Huber, Carola; Wieser, Simon","subject":" Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362.1041","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Die Schweiz zahlt hohen Preis für nicht-übertragbare Krankheiten : gesundheitsökonomische Studie identifiziert die teuersten Krankheiten der Schweiz;  Gesundheitsökonomie; Ob Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, Krebs oder Atemwegserkrankungen: Solche sogenannten nicht-übertragbaren Krankheiten (non-communicable diseases, NCDs) stellen heutzutage die häufigste Todesursache von Frauen und Männern in der Schweiz dar.

A clear understanding of the nature of IADL and its limitations in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is lacking. Literature suggests numerous possible influencing factors, e.g. cognitive function, but has not considered other domains of human functioning, such as environmental factors. Our aim was to develop a comprehensive model of IADL functioning that depicts the relevant influencing factors.Methods:We conducted a four-round online Delphi study with a sample of international IADL experts (N = ). In the first round, panelists were asked to mention all possible relevant cognitive and physical function factors, as well as environmental and personal factors, that influence IADL functioning. In the subsequent rounds, panelists rated the relevance of these factors. Consensus was defined as: ) ≥% agreement between panelists on a factor, and ) stability over two successive rounds.Results: Response rates from the four rounds were high ( to %). In the first round,  influencing factors were mentioned, whereof  factors reached consensus in the subsequent rounds. These consensual factors were used to build a model of IADL functioning. The final model included: five cognitive function factors (i.e. memory, attention, executive function, and two executive function subdomains -problem solving / reasoning and organization / planning); five physical function factors (i.e. seeing functions, hearing functions, balance, gait / mobility functions and functional mobility functions); two environmental factors (i.e. social network / environment and support of social network / environment); and one personal factor (i.e. education).Conclusions: This study proposes a comprehensive model of IADL functioning in people with MCI. The results from this Delphi study suggest that IADL functioning is not merely affected by cognitive function factors, but also by physical function factors, environmental factors and personal factors. The multiplicity of factors mentioned in the first round also underlines the individuality of IADL functioning in people with MCI. This model may serve as a basis for future research in IADL functioning in people with MCI.","doc_id":12458,"prior":"Krankheiten","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"57","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23066","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"To vaccinate or not to vaccinate : this is the question among Swiss university students","authors":"Dratva, Julia; Wagner, Aylin; Zysset, Annina; Volken, Thomas","subject":"COVID-19; Students; Vaccination intention; Vaccine hesitancy; Young adults; Public health; Emerging adulthood;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"305, 614","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"To vaccinate or not to vaccinate : this is the question among Swiss university students; COVID-; Students; Vaccination intention; Vaccine hesitancy; Young adults; Public health; Emerging adulthood;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; This article belongs to the Special Issue \"Vaccine Hesitancy and COVID-\"; The speed and innovation of the COVID- vaccine development has been accompanied by insecurity and skepticism.

EUROCONTROL’s voluntary ATM incident reporting system EVAIR is a platform for pilot to report relevant incidents, such as GNSS outages. In the years  and  more than  and  GPS outages were reported compared to less than  events in the previous years. While the tool is giving a good geographic perspective about the typical RFI hotspots, it is ultimately based on voluntarily reported data. As pilots get used to widespread RFI in certain areas and Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) are published that RFI should be expected, these events are considered to be normal. This likely leads to the numbers behind the GNSS outages reported in EVAIR being significantly underestimated. In this presentation we will give the audience a feel for why we believe this to be true: outages in GNSS service due to RFI initially manifest themselves in the cockpit in subtle ways, not immediately identifiable to the unaware. Background: The Nicosia Flight Information Region (FIR) has long reported difficulties with GNSS service coverage. It regularly issues NOTAMs warning pilots of the phenomenon and kindly requests radio reports of such observations. Pilots regularly report loss of GNSS on approach to Larnaca International Airport (LCA) making the introduction of GNSS-based approach procedures impossible. While many aircraft can cope with GNSS outages easily by using terrestrial navigation aids and/or Inertial Reference Systems onboard the aircraft, some aircraft do not have this option and may require ATC support. This is causing an increase in workload for air traffic controllers and pilots of the affected aircraft alike. As a way to better understand the prevalence of the phenomenon and its implications on main-line aircraft, DLR flew its Airbus  to LCA, equipped with a variety of GNSS monitoring instruments, including the baseline avionics of the aircraft, a set of experimental GNSS receivers and a recorder for sampling the raw radio signal. Observations and Data: An important feature of the flight is that we have been able to analyze the phenomenon from several perspectives. This includes photographs of the cockpit displays, and matching recordings of GNSS signals, where available, in terms of pseudorange and signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we collected raw, pre-correlator signal samples, the analysis of which offers a very particular type of insight. The raw signal was captured with a recording device, after being downconverted to baseband. The sampling rate was set to . MHz, at eight bits per sample. This quality of recording allows us to study the response of a GNSS receiver in “playback” mode, but it also enables an analysis of the frequency contents of the radio band in question. Reception and Impact While it is not a particularly novel message that GNSS signals are being jammed with RFI in some parts of the world, the aviation community has already reacted to our findings. Some of the results have been discussed at EUROCONTROL-hosted events, as well as a white paper. The Cypriot Department of Civil Aviation has, since, stated that the measurements prompted a revision of the threat model behind the RFI events. As for the wider aviation community, these observations and measurements clearly show a need to revise the paradigms for the provision of resilient navigation services. An outdate understanding of the RFI threat was based on individual drivers sporadically disrupting GNSS services at airports, for example by using GNSS privacy devices. Our measurements make it evident that this threat model is outdated, as GNSS outages clearly last several hours (potentially even more) and cover an entire FIR. The Presentation: We will present the measurements and results discussed above in a presentation designed to create awareness of the impact of RFI on avionics hardware. During this flight we observed that it is easy for pilots to underappreciate the degree of disruption to their GNSS avionics. An important part of the message is that we have found no evidence of intentional misleading, inside the GNSS signals. The service disruptions are likely collateral to the geopolitical reality of the region. In this sense, the results show that there is no direct threat to the safety of air traffic and, consequently, the need to act may not be acute. The results do, however, show a need to modernize the airspace and CNS infrastructure, to reflect the evolving nature of the RFI threat. We consider it important to point to the reduction in redundancy, and therefore in safety, that stems from a systematic, permanent disruption of the primary means of navigation. Disruptions of GNSS are also known to increase controller workload and cause other forms of operational expenses, for example due to increased numbers of go-arounds.","doc_id":12504,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21852","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"AquaSparkTM : rapid environmental monitoring of Listeria monocytogenes","authors":"Ganz, Giverny; Reinau, Lukas; Imhaus, Anne Flore; Hupfeld, Mario; Fieseler, Lars","subject":"Environmental monitoring; Food microbiology; Humans; Listeria monocytogenes;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"664","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"AquaSparkTM : rapid environmental monitoring of Listeria monocytogenes; Environmental monitoring; Food microbiology; Humans; Listeria monocytogenes;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; In order to prevent microbial contamination of food, monitoring of the production environment, together with the rapid detection of foodborne pathogens have proven to be of utmost importance for Food Safety.

Currently, three major strategies are evolving. Firstly, various pharmacological agents (growth factors, interleukins, small molecules, DNA/RNA) are locally applied at the ischemic region. Secondly, preparations of living cells with considerable bandwidth of tissue origin, differentiation state and preconditioning are delivered locally, rarely systemically. Thirdly, based on the notion, that cellular effects can be attributed mostly to factors secreted in situ, the cellular secretome (conditioned media, exosomes) has come into the spotlight. We review these three strategies to achieve (neo)angiogenesis in ischemic tissue with focus on the angiogenic mechanisms they tackle, such as transcription cascades, specific signalling steps and cellular gases. We also include cancer-therapy relevant lymphangiogenesis, and shall seek to explain why there are often conflicting data between in vitro and in vivo. The lion's share of data encompassing all three approaches comes from experimental animal work and we shall highlight common technical obstacles in the delivery of therapeutic molecules, cells, and secretome. This plethora of preclinical data contrasts with a dearth of clinical studies. A lack of adequate delivery vehicles and standardised assessment of clinical outcomes might play a role here, as well as regulatory, IP, and manufacturing constraints of candidate compounds; in addition, completed clinical trials have yet to reveal a successful and efficacious strategy. As the biology of angiogenesis is understood well enough for clinical purposes, it will be a matter of time to achieve success for well-stratified patients, and most probably with a combination of compounds.","doc_id":12614,"prior":"cancer-therapy","SDG3":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12712","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Health economic modelling of the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in Switzerland","authors":"Kessler, Reto; Keusch, Gérard; Szucs, Thomas; Wittenborn, John; Hoerger, Thomas; Brügger, Urs; Wieser, Simon","subject":"Albuminuria; Cost-benefit analysis; Disease progression; Follow-up study; Mass screening; Prevalence; Retrospective study; Economic models;  Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362.1041","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Health economic modelling of the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in Switzerland; Albuminuria; Cost-benefit analysis; Disease progression; Follow-up study; Mass screening; Prevalence; Retrospective study; Economic models;  Gesundheitsökonomie; Principles: Current evidence indicates that chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be detected by simple laboratory tests. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening and subsequent treatment in different populations. Methods: Cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in a cohort of simulated subjects aged ≥ years was assessed using a validated microsimulation model. Microalbuminuria screening was simulated for -, -, - or -year intervals and for  groups: diabetes (DM), hypertension but no diabetes (HTN), and no diabetes or hypertension. Positive microalbuminuria screening was followed by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The model outcomes evaluate costs from a health care system perspective.Results: Screening of risk groups is cost-effective at a -year interval for the DM group with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of , CHF/ Quality Adjusted-Life-Years (QALY) and at a -year interval for the HTN group with an ICER of ,CHF/QALY . Screening of the remaining population is cost-effective at a -year interval with an ICER of , CHF/QALY . The ICER improves with longer screening intervals for all groups. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) confirmed -year, -year and -year intervals as the most cost-effective for the DM group, the HTN group and the remaining population respectively.Conclusions: Microalbuminuria screening can be considered cost-effective starting at the age of  years at biannual intervals for subjects with diabetes, at -year intervals for subjects with hypertension and at-year intervals for the remaining population.

Among these patients, about one sixth included women of childbearing potential. Therefore, the wish of getting pregnant is frequent in these peculiar patients, and careful planning and management of the pregnancies requires the expertise of obstetricians, midwives and transplant experts. Altogether, the outcome of the pregnancies in these women is acceptable. About % off all pregnancies ended successfully with live births, and this is comparable if not superior to pregnancies in healthy women. This success might be caused not only by the special and intensive care provided to these high-risk pregnancies by the transplant centres but also by the low rate of unplanned pregnancies. The risk of rejections and organ loss after delivery is about %, and it is slightly enhanced in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) in comparison to kidney graft recipients (KTRs) but the number of organ losses in direct association with a pregnancy is rare. However, there is not only a higher frequency of pregnancy-associated disorders such as pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery but also an acceleration of hypertension, new-onset diabetes mellitus and newly arising infections also favoured by the maintained immunosuppressive therapy. This implies a specialized 'control system' for these pregnant women that comprises ultrasound and Doppler investigation for risk assessment, infection screening, suitable therapy and the choice of non-teratogenic immunosuppressives. Antihypertensive treatment must be well balanced and adjusted to the possible growth-retarding effect on the foetus as well as on the co-morbidity of the mother. Finally, supplementation of vitamin D and iron is much more important in these transplanted women than in healthy pregnant women as vitamin D deficiency and anaemia are discussed to have an impact on pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery. These claims are widely discussed. Furthermore, the current literature is systematically reviewed by Scopus analysis.","doc_id":12729,"prior":"diabetes","SDG3":1},{"id":"45","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22736","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"How accurate and precise can we measure the posture and the energy expenditure component of sedentary behaviour with one sensor?","authors":"Kuster, Roman P.; Grooten, Wilhelmus J.

Escape mutations in viral epitopes-immunogenic peptide parts presented on the surface of infected cells-allow HIV to partially evade these responses, and thus rapidly go to fixation. The faster they go to fixation, i.e., the higher their escape rate, the larger the selective pressure exerted by the immune system is assumed to be. This relation underpins the rationale for using escapes to assess the strength of immune responses. However, escape rate estimates are often obtained by employing an aggregation procedure, where several mutations that affect the same epitope are aggregated into a single, composite epitope mutation. The aggregation procedure thus rests upon the assumption that all within-epitope mutations have indistinguishable effects on immune recognition. In this study, we investigate how violation of this assumption affects escape rate estimates. To this end, we extend a previously developed simulation model of HIV that accounts for mutation, selection, and recombination to include different distributions of fitness effects (DFEs) and inter-mutational genomic distances. We use this discrete time Wright-Fisher based model to simulate early within-host evolution of HIV for DFEs and apply standard estimation methods to infer the escape rates. We then compare true with estimated escape rate values. We also compare escape rate values obtained by applying the aggregation procedure with values estimated without use of that procedure. We find that across the DFEs analyzed, the aggregation procedure alters the detectability of escape mutations: large-effect mutations are overrepresented while small-effect mutations are concealed. The effect of the aggregation procedure is similar to extracting the largest-effect mutation appearing within an epitope. Furthermore, the more pronounced the over-exponential decay of the DFEs, the more severely true escape rates are underestimated. We conclude that the aggregation procedure has two main consequences. On the one hand, it leads to a misrepresentation of the DFE of fixed mutations. On the other hand, it conceals within-epitope interactions that may generate irregularities in mutation frequency trajectories that are thus left unexplained.","doc_id":12755,"prior":"human immunodeficiency virus","SDG3":1},{"id":"67","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23515","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Früherkennung und Frühintervention von psychischen Schwierigkeiten im Jugendverein Jungwacht Blauring : wie können Jugendvereinsleitende als Multiplikator*innen befähigt werden?","authors":"Friedli, Julia","subject":"Früherkennung; Multiplikator*innen; Jugendliche; Verein; Frühintervention; Psychische Gesundheit;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"305, 616.89","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Früherkennung und Frühintervention von psychischen Schwierigkeiten im Jugendverein Jungwacht Blauring : wie können Jugendvereinsleitende als Multiplikator*innen befähigt werden?; Früherkennung; Multiplikator*innen; Jugendliche; Verein; Frühintervention; Psychische Gesundheit;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie; Darstellung des Themas: Psychische Erkrankungen stellen eine grosse gesundheitspolitische Herausforderung der Schweiz dar. Reagiert man frühzeitig auf psychische Auffälligkeiten, reduziert sich das Risiko, an einer schwerwiegenden psychischen Störung zu erkranken. Zur Förderung der psychischen Gesundheit in jungen Jahren können Leitungspersonen in Verbänden und Vereinen eine wichtige Funktion innehaben. Ziel (Fragestellung): Das Ziel der Arbeit ist es herauszufinden, wie Jugendvereinsleitenden von Jungwacht Blauring als Multiplikator*innen einen Beitrag zur Früherkennung und Frühintervention von psychischen Schwierigkeiten bei ihren Mitleitenden und jugendlichen Teilnehmenden leisten können. Methode /Vorgehen: Das qualitative Untersuchungsdesign besteht aus sechs Leitfaden-Interviews mit Leitenden von Jungwacht Blauring, einer Fokusgruppe mit drei Expert*innen von Jungwacht Blauring und einem Experteninterview mit einer Jugendpsychologin. Die Ergebnisse sind durch eine qualitative Inhaltsanalyse nach Mayring ausgewertet. Zentrale Ergebnisse: Damit Jugendvereinsleitende als Multiplikator*innen zur Erkennung von psychischen Schwierigkeiten befähigt werden können, benötigen sie ein Basiswissen über psychische Gesundheit und Krankheit sowie Gesprächsfertigkeiten. Dazu bedarf es an konkreten Übungs- und Anwendungsmöglichkeiten und Unterstützung durch verantwortungsbewusste Erwachsene. Schlussfolgerung: Jugendvereinsleitende von Jungwacht Blauring können durch gezielte Multiplikator*innenschulungen einen Beitrag zur Früherkennung und Frühintervention von psychischen Schwierigkeiten leisten. Jugendverbände haben ein grosses Potenzial zur Förderung der psychischen Gesundheit.","doc_id":12760,"prior":"Psychische Gesundheit","SDG3":1},{"id":"69","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15714","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Comparing US and Swiss  health care spending by diseases : where the money goes in the highest spending countries","authors":"Wieser, Simon; Dieleman, Joseph; Squires, Ellen","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Comparing US and Swiss  health care spending by diseases : where the money goes in the highest spending countries;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Objectives: With over , USD per year the US and Switzerland have the highest per capita health care spending in the world.

There is limited knowledge about the psychometric quality of the reduced version of the KIDSCREEN questionnaire with only  items.Methods: Analysis of psychometric properties was done by fitting Rasch models and graphical loglinear Rasch models to data collected in a study on acculturation of primary school children and their teachers in .Results: The data did not fit a Rasch model but did fit a graphical loglinear Rasch model. There was local dependence for four item pairs and differential item functioning for gender and citizenship.Conclusions: The KIDSCREEN- provides essentially valid measurements of health-related quality of life in children if local dependency and dif ferential item functioning are taken into account. Reliability and targeting were less than satisfactory, especially for certain subgroups but reliability was adequate for most groups.","doc_id":12781,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"21","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23680","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Honig, die süsse Alternative : Honig zur Behandlung und Pflege von Wunden im Wochenbett","authors":"Egli, Lena; Früh, Thirza","subject":"Wound care; Wundversorgung; Honey; Honig; Perineal tear; Geburtsverletzung; Breastfeeding; Stillen; Caesarean-section; Sectio caesarea;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"618","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Honig, die süsse Alternative : Honig zur Behandlung und Pflege von Wunden im Wochenbett; Wound care; Wundversorgung; Honey; Honig; Perineal tear; Geburtsverletzung; Breastfeeding; Stillen; Caesarean-section; Sectio caesarea;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Hintergrund: In Schweizer Spitälern erfolgt die Behandlung von Geburtsverletzungen und Wunden im Wochenbett häufig nach einem bestimmten Schema sowie erst nach dem Auftreten von Komplikationen oder Schmerzen.

Parameter estimation is, however, error-prone due to the non-linearity of the signal model, the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the small volume fraction of perfusion in the in-vivo brain. In the present work, the performance of Bayesian inference was examined in the presence of brain pathologies characterized by hypo- and hyperperfusion. In particular, a hierarchical and a spatial prior were combined. Performance was compared relative to conventional segmented least squares regression, hierarchical prior only (non-segmented and segmented data likelihoods) and a deep learning approach. Realistic numerical brain IVIM simulations were conducted to assess errors relative to ground truth. In-vivo, data of  central nervous system cancer patients and  patients with acute stroke were acquired. The proposed method yielded reduced error in simulations for both the cancer and acute stroke scenarios compared to other methods across the whole investigated SNR range. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the proposed method was better or on par compared to the other techniques in-vivo. The proposed Bayesian approach hence improves IVIM parameter estimation in brain cancer and acute stroke.","doc_id":12882,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11178","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Insights into the CSR approach of Switzerland and CSR practices of swiss companies","authors":"Hetze, Katharina; Winistörfer, Herbert","subject":"CSR; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility activity; Global reporting initiative; Corporate sustainability; Corporate social responsibility practice;  Leitendes Management","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"658.4","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Insights into the CSR approach of Switzerland and CSR practices of swiss companies; CSR; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility activity; Global reporting initiative; Corporate sustainability; Corporate social responsibility practice;  Leitendes Management; Switzerland can be said to have a long tradition of corporate social responsibility which dates back to industrialization in the nineteenth Century and the introduction of the Federal Factory Law on working conditions in . Environmental legislation, on the other hand, only started to be enacted in the s. On this basis, the concept of CSR as it is practiced today—predominantly referred to as ‘sustainability’—became established after the year .The Swiss economy is based on the concept of a liberal economic system. This results in a policy of a minimalist state establishing the necessary framework—effective environmental legislation and protective social and labor laws—for the economy itself to follow. The state thus plays a minor role in regulating CSR, which is seen as business-driven. Compared to other European countries, the Swiss have fewer statutory requirements for CSR activities (e.g. reporting). However, the government promotes moderate CSR by providing guidelines and incentives for appropriate behavior (State Secretariat for Economic Affairs [SECO], a). In addition, Switzerland’s economy is seen as highly globalized with a strong export orientation. Hence, most Swiss companies operate in an international context where they depend on, and at the same time profit from, globalized supply chains. According to the Swiss Corporate Sustainability Survey  (Berger et al. (Swiss Corporate Sustainability Survey . Nachhaltigkeit in Schweizer Unternehmen. ZHAW School of Management and Law, )), Swiss companies are well aware of the importance of CSR and actively engage in CSR activities (Schaltegger et al. (International corporate sustainability barometer. A comparative analysis of  countries. CSM, Leuphana University Lüneburg, )), although they may be reluctant to discuss them publicly. There seems to be a difference between large companies and SMEs in their commitment to CSR and their approach to CSR practices due to the availability of human and financial resources. Major CSR issues for Swiss companies include energy efficiency and the reduction of CO emissions (environmental), employee health, gender equality and human rights in the supply chain (social) as well as tax evasion and excessive executives’ salaries (governance).","doc_id":12911,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8078","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Visual eHealth : an ICT innovation and dissemination strategy to improve our well-being","authors":"Pauchard, Yves; Ackermann, Philipp","subject":"Visualization; eHealth;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"005, 610","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Visual eHealth : an ICT innovation and dissemination strategy to improve our well-being; Visualization; eHealth;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Healthcare activities take place in a multi-disciplinary environment and on a cross-organizational scale.

Understanding such information requires specifc “health literacy” skills. Health literacy empowers individuals to exercise their autonomy and self-determination regarding health-related matters. This chapter explores how health literacy and ethical questions are interrelated as illustrated using actual patient narratives of a woman’s pregnancy experiences. The narratives were collected as part of the Swiss DIPEx (Database of individual patients’ experiences) database. We demonstrate that narratives of health experiences can be used to enhance health literacy. Firstly, narratives can convey complex information in an easily understandable manner. Secondly, they allow policymakers to understand, the informational needs of users of the health care system and the communication gaps they perceive can help improve the health care system and qualitative evaluate and improve medical communication efforts.

Moral distress can trigger emotional and physical reactions in nurses and can cause them to withdraw emotionally from patients or can cause them to change their work place.Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to develop an instrument to measure moral distress among acute care nurses in the German-speaking context, to test its applicability, and to obtain initial indications of the instrument’s validity.Method: The study was designed in  as a cross-sectional pilot survey. Conducted on eight units of one university hospital in German-speaking Switzerland,  registered nurses were asked to fill out a web-based questionnaire on moral distress.Ethical considerations: The study proposal was approved by the cantonal ethics committee. All participating nurses provided informed consent and were assured of data confidentiality.Results: The survey had a response rate of %.

Previous work has shown that these preparations are able to exert cytotoxic effects on carcinoma cells, the extent of which might be influenced by the host tree species and by the content of mistletoe lectin.Methods: Using colorimetric assays, we have now compared the cytotoxic effects of Viscum album preparations (VAPs) obtained from mistletoe growing on oak (Quercus robur and Q. petraea, VAP-Qu), apple tree (Malus domestica,, VAP-M), pine (Pinus sylvestris, VAP-P) or white fir (Abies pectinata, VAP-A), on the in vitro growth of breast and bladder carcinoma cell lines. While MFM-, KPL-, MCF- and HCC- were the breast carcinoma cell lines chosen, the panel of tested bladder carcinoma cells comprised the T-, TCC-SUP, UM-UC- and J- cell lines.Results: Each of the VAPs inhibited cell growth, but the extent of this inhibition differed with the preparation and with the cell line. The concentrations of VAP-Qu, VAP-M and VAP-A which led to a  % reduction of cell growth (IC) varied between . and . mg/ml. Higher concentrations of VAP-P were required to obtain a comparable effect. Purified mistletoe lectin I (MLI) led to an inhibition of breast carcinoma cell growth at concentrations lower than those of VAPs, but the sensitivity towards purified MLI did not parallel that towards VAPs. Bladder carcinoma cells were in most cases more sensitive to VAPs treatment than breast carcinoma cells. The total mistletoe lectin content was very high in VAP-Qu ( ng/mg extract), intermediate in VAP-M ( ng/mg extract), and very low in VAP-P (. ng/mg extract) and in VAP-A ( ng/mg extract). As to be expected from the low content of mistletoe lectin, VAP-P led to relatively weak cytotoxic effects. Most remarkably, however, the lectin-poor VAP-A revealed a cytotoxic effect comparable to, or even stronger than, that of the lectin-rich VAP-Qu, on all tested bladder and breast carcinoma cell lines.Conclusion: The results suggest the existence of cytotoxic components other than mistletoe lectin in VAP-A and reveal an unexpected potential of this preparation for the treatment of breast and bladder cancer.","doc_id":13209,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"42","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4922","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A closer look into German surveys : do overweight and obesity lead to eating disorder in children and adolescents?","authors":"Kocher, Gilda; Westenhöfer, Joachim; Brombach, Christine","subject":" Diätetik;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"613.2, 616.8","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"A closer look into German surveys : do overweight and obesity lead to eating disorder in children and adolescents?; .

To test for effects of memory consolidation in the human, we examined brain activation during the retrieval of information at  min and at  h following learning using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), an indirect measure of synaptic activity. Learning instructions were adjusted to yield a comparable retrieval quantity and retrieval quality at  min and  h after learning. The left hippocampal formation exhibited enhanced activity during the retrieval at the  h lag compared to the retrieval at the  min lag. Moreover, the activity in the left anterior hippocampal formation showed stronger correlations with retrieval quantity and retrieval quality at the  h lag than at the  min lag.

Für Ergotherapeuten stellt dies eine Herausforderung dar, da in kurzer Behandlungsdauer klientenzentrierte und betätigungsbasierte Interventionen entwickelt und durchgeführt werden müssen. In diesem Beitrag werden während einer Krisenintervention im stationären psychiatrischen Setting Klientenerfahrungen zu bedeutungsvollen Betätigungen gesammelt. Durch ein tieferes Verständnis anhand von Fallbeispielen werden erste Überlegungen zu der Frage angestellt, wie ergotherapeutische Interventionen effektiv und effizient bedeutungsvolle Betätigung ermöglichen können.Methoden: Sechs Teilnehmer wurden jeweils zweimal interviewt, einmal während ihres Krankenhausaufenthaltes und einmal nach ihrer Entlassung. Die induktive Analyse nach inhaltlichen Themen wurde mit der Software ATLAS-ti durchgeführt.Ergebnisse: Das Erleben von Sinnlosigkeit wurde als Phase von Betätigungs-Dysfunktion identifiziert. Mit den Aktivitäten wurde nur den Betätigungs-Bedürfnissen wie Ablenkung, sozialer Inklusion und Routine entsprochen. Bedeutungsvolle Betätigung erlebten die Klienten nur am Ende ihres Krankenhausaufenthaltes, mit beginnender Rekonstruktion ihrer Betätigungs – Identität nach Überwindung der Krise. Diskussion: Die Ergebnisse illustrieren den Prozess der Betätigungs-Rekonstruktion von der Betätigungs- Dysfunktion (Sinnlosigkeit) über das „Tun und Dazugehören” (Mitmachen) zu „Sein und Werden” (Selbstfindung).

For occupational therapists working in this setting, it remains challenging to create successful occupationbased and client-centred occupational therapy programs. Therefore, it is essential to understand client’s experiences with occupational therapy intervention during crisis intervention in a clinical setting, to be able to provide our clients with the most effective and efficient services.Methods: Six participants were interviewed twice by the same researcher once on their inpatient hospital stay and once after their discharge. Thematic analysis was applied to transcriptions with identification of themes from description to interpretation using ATLAS-ti Software.Results: A state of meaninglessness has been identified as a phase of occupational dysfunction caused by multidimensional factors. Through activities, individual’s occupational needs, namely, diversion, social inclusion and routine, were met.

It is believed that the -dimensional spheroid presents cells with a more physiological microenvironment to grow so that they behave more like cells in vivo, which is lacking in conventional -dimensional monolayer cultures. Recently, it has been reported that cancer cells grown as spheroids could express stem cell-associated genes. Hence, it is investigated whether normal mouse and human fibroblasts cultured as spheroids could also be induced to express stem cell-associated genes. The transcriptomes of human fibroblasts cultured as a monolayer and spheroids are compared and analyzed using real-time RT-qPCR, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatics. The results reveal that the spheroid transcriptome resemble somatic cells being reprogramed into stem cells, including the induced expression of stemness-associated genes, increased expression of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition-associated genes, and decreased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-associated genes. In this context, it is hypothesized that during the process of spheroid formation, matrix-cell signaling is lost in favor of cell-cell contact signaling and that this subsequently increases the activity of the PIK/Akt pathway that then upregulates Tbdx and stemness-associated genes.","doc_id":13281,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/798","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Psychische Belastungen und Lebensqualität von Patienten und nahen Angehörigen durch eine Krebsdiagnose","authors":"Broek-Schneiter, Anna-Katharina van den","subject":"Krebskranker; Angehöriger; Psychische Belastung; Lebensqualität;  Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"150","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Psychische Belastungen und Lebensqualität von Patienten und nahen Angehörigen durch eine Krebsdiagnose; Krebskranker; Angehöriger; Psychische Belastung; Lebensqualität;  Psychologie","doc_id":13291,"prior":"Krebskranker","SDG3":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/798","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Psychische Belastungen und Lebensqualität von Patienten und nahen Angehörigen durch eine Krebsdiagnose","authors":"Broek-Schneiter, Anna-Katharina van den","subject":"Krebskranker; Angehöriger; Psychische Belastung; Lebensqualität;  Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"150","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Psychische Belastungen und Lebensqualität von Patienten und nahen Angehörigen durch eine Krebsdiagnose; Krebskranker; Angehöriger; Psychische Belastung; Lebensqualität;  Psychologie","doc_id":13291,"prior":"Krebsdiagnose","SDG3":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2838","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Molecular recognition of the catalytic zinc(II) ion in MMP-13 : structure-based evolution of an allosteric inhibitor to dual binding mode inhibitors with improved lipophilic ligand efficiencies","authors":"Fischer, Thomas; Riedl, Rainer","subject":"Structure-based drug design; Medicinal chemistry; Organic chemistry;  Biochemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 615","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Molecular recognition of the catalytic zinc(II) ion in MMP- : structure-based evolution of an allosteric inhibitor to dual binding mode inhibitors with improved lipophilic ligand efficiencies; Structure-based drug design; Medicinal chemistry; Organic chemistry;  Biochemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a class of zinc dependent endopeptidases which play a crucial role in a multitude of severe diseases such as cancer and osteoarthritis.

Guided by molecular modeling, we optimized an initial allosteric inhibitor by addition of linker fragments and weak zinc binders for recognition of the catalytic center. Furthermore we improved the lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE) of the initial inhibitor by adding appropriate zinc binding fragments to lower the clogP values of the inhibitors, while maintaining their potency. All synthesized inhibitors showed elevated affinity compared to the initial hit, also most of the novel inhibitors displayed better LLE.

The literature shows that the hospitalisation rate in rehabilitation facilities has increased in recent years and that a gender bias exists. Additionally, there is little or no evidence available on the effect that a post‑acute care programme might have over an extended period on functioning, quality of life and the informal network of older people. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the sustainability of post‑acute care within three nursing homes in Zurich, Canton of Zurich, Switzerland.Methods: The Prevention Admission into Nursing homes (PAN) study is a explorative, prospective, longitudinal pilot trial based on a convenience sample of three long‑term care facilities in the Swiss Canton of Zurich. The proposed pilot study will examine the effects of a post‑acute care programme on people aged ≥ years with a post‑acute care potential ≥ three admitted to any of the three post‑acute care units (n = ). Older people of all sexes admitted to one of the post‑acute care units and likely to be discharged to home within  weeks will be eligible for participation in the study. The primary endpoint is functionality based on the Barthel Index. The secondary endpoints are independency based on delirium, cognition, mobility, falling concerns, frailty, weight/height/body mass index, post‑acute care capability, quality of life, and lastly, the informal network. As part of process evaluation, a qualitative evaluation will be conducted based on constructive grounded theory to specifically analyse how the experience of informal caregivers (n = ) can contribute to a successful daily life  months after discharge.Discussion: We expect to observe improved functional status and independence after the post‑acute care programme.

The concept of microinsurance is a solution to help mitigating the vicious cycle of poverty, while also offering insurance companies an opportunity for strategic market expansion in this vast untapped market. In the African microinsurance market, a share of only -% of the low- and middle-income population is covered by a microinsurance policy. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate distribution channels with the potential to promote microinsurance products in the East African market based on selected supply-and-demand side criteria and taking into consideration economic, financial and social factors. Thereby, this study followed a qualitative approach that included both secondary and primary research, the latter being conducted in the form of four semi-structured expert interviews. It was identified that the microinsurance market is still in its infancy and the challenges are various. The low-income target groups have continued negative perceptions of insurance companies and their products. They consequently have a lack of trust in them and see limited value in it. This is compounded by low financial literacy rates of the target customers and insurers have limited access to potential customers as urbanization rates are low. Therefore, facing these challenges, insurance companies rely mainly on distribution channels that provide direct, personal and broad access to these low-income individuals. Especially the distribution of products through cooperatives and community-organizations is a valuable option because trust, transparency and sustainability are ensured. Furthermore, it is crucial to embed the insurance product into the business of distributors such as microfinance institutions and retail stores to integrate insurance further into these low-income population’s life. Mobile Network Operators, which are widely known and used in the market on a daily basis, represent a promising option for the future if the issue of simplicity of the products is further solved. Nevertheless, additional capacity building in the form of trainings, information campaigns using simple pictures is essential to overcome the aforementioned issues and to enhance financial literacy and trust in the East African market.Digital platforms, evolving in Africa at high growth rates, have an important impact on the further development of microinsurance distribution. The integration of technology-based tools to develop the microinsurance market is a viable opportunity for insurance companies to facilitate processes, scale the business and reach more customers even in rural areas while optimizing the distribution costs. An interesting focus for further research is therefore the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data and as a result new business models such as index-based insurance or on-demand insurance to further penetrate and develop the microinsurance market.","doc_id":13472,"prior":"diseases","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"55","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20104","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Commentary to “antidepressants and suicidality : a re-analysis of the re-analysis”","authors":"Plöderl, Martin; Hengartner, Michael Pascal; Bschor, Tom; Kaminski, Jakob André","subject":" Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Commentary to “antidepressants and suicidality : a re-analysis of the re-analysis”;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","doc_id":13512,"prior":"suicidality","SDG3":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1279","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Schutz durch einen Stich? : Nutzen und Risiken der Influenzaimpfung während der Schwangerschaft für das neonatale Outcome in Bezug auf die Frühgeburt und Small for Gestational Age","authors":"Flück, Martina Monika; Rüthemann, Sarina Natascha","subject":"Pregnancy; Influenza vaccination; Neonatal outcome; Risks; Preterm; Small for gestational age;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"618","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Schutz durch einen Stich? : Nutzen und Risiken der Influenzaimpfung während der Schwangerschaft für das neonatale Outcome in Bezug auf die Frühgeburt und Small for Gestational Age; Pregnancy; Influenza vaccination; Neonatal outcome; Risks; Preterm; Small for gestational age;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Darstellung des Themas: Universal wird die Impfung für alle schwangeren Frauen während allen Trimestern empfohlen.

At age , the occurrence of hot flushes/night sweats and sleep disturbances was significantly more frequent in peri- and post-menopausal women. Irritability/nervousness was increased only in peri-menopausal women, but that association was accounted for by neuroticism trait scores at age . Transitions to peri- or post-menopause were not related to changes in either the prevalence rates of DSM major depressive episode or anxiety disorders, or the course of psychopathological syndromes as assessed by the Symptom Checklist  - Revised. The null associations held when adjusting for duration of reproductive period or age at menopause. Preceding mental health problems between ages  and , increased neuroticism trait scores at age , and concurrent psychosocial distress were significantly related to mental health problems occurring between ages  and . Depending upon the cut-off point that was chosen, the arbitrary dichotomization of a continuous depression outcome produced spurious associations with the menopausal transition.

Rasch analysis was used to examine scale validity, validity of therapists' rating patterns of clients, rater consistency, precision of client measurement and the scale's aptitude in detecting different ability levels.Results: All items except one demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit to the Rasch model. Over % of clients fitted the model. The scale detected five ability levels, but client measures were slightly imprecise. Raters used the scale consistently and implications of rater leniency are discussed.Conclusion: The study provides evidence of construct validity, supporting the use of the WRI as a standardised baseline assessment in a mental health population.

We added the trait-scores from all DSM-IV PDs, as assessed by a self-report questionnaire, to provide a measure of general personality dysfunction. Adjusting for the Big Five personality domains as a proxy for stylistic PD elements, this composite PD score exhibited strong associations with neuroticism and schizotypy. General personality dysfunction additionally revealed a moderate detrimental association with psychosocial functioning and a strong effect on coping resources, on heavy drinking and drug use and on most psychopathological syndromes. Of particular interest is the strong association with total psychopathological distress and co-occurrence of multiple disorders, suggesting that increasing PD severity relates to the degree of global impairment independent of specific PD traits.

Agreement on a core set of reliable, valid and accessible outcome measures to assess rehabilitation outcomes is needed to generate strong evidence about effectiveness of rehabilitation approaches, including technologies. This paper collates and synthesizes a core set from multiple sources; combining existing evidence, clinical practice guidelines and expert consensus into European recommendations for Clinical Assessment of Upper Limb In Neurorehabilitation (CAULIN).Methods: Data from systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines and expert consensus (Delphi methodology) were systematically extracted and synthesized using strength of evidence rating criteria, in addition to recommendations on assessment procedures. Three sets were defined: a core set: strong evidence for validity, reliability, responsiveness and clinical utility AND recommended by at least two sources; an extended set: strong evidence OR recommended by at least two sources and a supplementary set: some evidence OR recommended by at least one of the sources.Results: In total,  measures (with primary focus on stroke) were included, encompassing body function and activity level of the International Classification of Functioning and Health. The core set recommended for clinical practice and research: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); the extended set recommended for clinical practice and/or clinical research: kinematic measures, Box and Block Test (BBT), Chedoke Arm Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and ABILHAND; the supplementary set recommended for research or specific occasions: Motricity Index (MI); Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA), Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment Movement (STREAM), Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) and body-worn movement sensors. Assessments should be conducted at pre-defined regular intervals by trained personnel. Global measures should be applied within  h of hospital admission and upper limb specific measures within  week.Conclusions: The CAULIN recommendations for outcome measures and assessment procedures provide a clear, simple, evidence-based three-level structure for upper limb assessment in neurological rehabilitation. Widespread adoption and sustained use will improve quality of clinical practice and facilitate meta-analysis, critical for the advancement of technology-supported neurorehabilitation.","doc_id":14040,"prior":"Krankheiten","posterior":"accessible","SDG3":1},{"id":"8","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17738","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Costs of hypoglycemia in insulin-treated diabetes in Switzerland : a health-economic analysis","authors":"Wieser, Simon; Tzogiou, Christina; Hess, Sascha; Eichler, Klaus; Azoulay, Marie; Djalali, Sima; Rosemann, Thomas; Brändle, Michael","subject":" Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362.1041","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Costs of hypoglycemia in insulin-treated diabetes in Switzerland : a health-economic analysis;  Gesundheitsökonomie","doc_id":14043,"prior":"diabetes","SDG3":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9213","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Simple and rapid sample preparation for 25OH-Vitamin D3/D2 using an immobilized liquid","authors":"Weibel, Roland; Zaborosch, Christiane; Svoboda, Michal; Geyer, Roland; Bartl, Ralf","subject":"Diagnostic; Sample preparation; Mass spectrometry; Vitamin D;  Chemie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"540","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Simple and rapid sample preparation for OH-Vitamin D/D using an immobilized liquid; Diagnostic; Sample preparation; Mass spectrometry; Vitamin D;  Chemie; The metabolites OH-Vitamin D/D represent the storage form of Vitamin D for the human body.

In addition, this sample preparation procedure bears a promising potential for straight forward automation.","doc_id":14051,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17556","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Grenzüberschreitende Tätigkeit von Pflegedienstleistungserbringern","authors":"Petrik, Andreas","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Grenzüberschreitende Tätigkeit von Pflegedienstleistungserbringern;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Nach der Ablehnung des EWR-Beitritts durch das Schweizervolk vor  Jahren wurden die Beziehungen der Schweiz zur Europäischen Union (EU) und ihren Mitgliedstaaten durch den Abschluss von weiteren Abkommen intensiviert.

Aufgrund dessen wurden zahlreiche berufsspezifische Hilfsangebote aufgebaut. Im Sinne der Gesundheitsförderung und Prävention bieten sich Massnahmen an, die bei den Lebensverhältnissen ansetzen und die Entstehung von Burnout vorbeugen können. Fragestellung: In welchen verhältnisorientierten Massnahmen zur Prävention oder Früherkennung von Burnout bei Landwirt*innen sieht die Dialoggruppe am meisten Potenzial und warum? Methode: Anhand eines halbstrukturierten Leitfadens wurden zwei Online-Fokusgruppen mit Landwirt*innen und Expert*innen durchgeführt, welche gemeinsam die Dialoggruppe darstellen. Inhalt der Diskussion waren die drei bestbewerteten Ideen für Massnahmen, die sich aus der vorgängigen quantitativen Online-Befragung abgezeichnet haben. In den Fokusgruppen wurde erörtert, warum in den bestbewerteten Ideen grosses Potenzial gesehen wird. Die daraus entstandenen Daten wurden transkribiert und gemäss der inhaltlich strukturierenden Inhaltsanalyse von Kuckartz mittels der Software MAXQDA ausgewertet. Zentrales Ergebnis: Die Dialoggruppe ist sich einig, dass die psychische Gesundheit in der Betriebsleiterschule obligatorisch thematisiert werden sollte und sieht darin sehr grosses Potenzial. Die psychische Gesundheit ist einer der zentralen Erfolgsfaktoren für die erfolgreiche Führung eines Unternehmens. Schlussfolgerung: Eine Projektkonzeption anhand des Best-Practice-Handlungsrahmens bietet sich in dieser Lebenswelt an, wobei die Partizipation von Landwirt*innen einen besonders wichtigen Stellenwert einnimmt, damit effektive und akzeptierte Interventionen entstehen können.","doc_id":14063,"prior":"Psychische Gesundheit","SDG3":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23472","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Impact of a diabetes disease management program on guideline-concordant care, hospitalization risk and health care costs : a propensity score matching study using real-world data","authors":"Wirth, Brigitte; Carlander, Maria; Höglinger, Marc","subject":" Gesundheitsökonomie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362.1041, 616","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Impact of a diabetes disease management program on guideline-concordant care, hospitalization risk and health care costs : a propensity score matching study using real-world data;  Gesundheitsökonomie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Background and status of research: Findings about the effectiveness of disease management programs (DMPs) in the treatment of diabetes are inconsistent.

It could be seen as a means to strengthen people’s autonomy as they learn more about their personal health risks, and receive dietary advice accordingly. We examine in what sense personalized nutrition strengthens or weakens individual autonomy. The impact of personalized nutrition on autonomy is analyzed in relation to responsibility and trustworthiness. On a societal level, individualization of health promotion may be accompanied by the attribution of extended individual responsibility for one’s health. This constitutes a dilemma of individualization, caused by a conflict between the right to individual freedom and societal interests. The extent to which personalized nutrition strengthens autonomy is consequently influenced by how responsibility for health is allocated to individuals. Ethically adequate allocation of responsibility should focus on prospective responsibility and be differentiated with regard to individual differences concerning the capacity of adults to take responsibility. The impact of personalized nutrition on autonomy also depends on its methodological design. Owing to the complexity of information received, personalized nutrition through genetic testing (PNTGT) is open to misinterpretation and may not facilitate informed choices and autonomy. As new technologies, personalized nutrition and PNTGT are subject to issues of trust. To strengthen autonomy, trust should be approached in terms of trustworthiness. Trustworthiness implies that an organization that develops or introduces personalized nutrition can show that it is competent to deal with both the technical and moral dimensions at stake and that its decisions are motivated by the interests and expectations of the truster.","doc_id":14225,"prior":"health risks","SDG3":1},{"id":"3","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19809","date":"2020","language":"de; fr; it","title":"JAMESfocus : Mediennutzung und Gesundheit","authors":"Bernath, Jael; Suter, Lilian; Waller, Gregor; Willemse, Isabel; Külling, Céline; Süss, Daniel","subject":"JAMES Studie; Digitales Medium; Psychische Gesundheit; Physische Gesundheit; Schlaf;  Soziale Interaktion;  Soziale Gruppen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"302, 305","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"JAMESfocus : Mediennutzung und Gesundheit; JAMES Studie; Digitales Medium; Psychische Gesundheit; Physische Gesundheit; Schlaf;  Soziale Interaktion;  Soziale Gruppen; Der JAMESfocus Bericht stellt das Thema Gesundheit ins Zentrum.

We will assess what () role psychological resources, () early and late-life socio-economic position (SEP) and () people’s life course play on poverty dynamics in old age. Particular interest will be given to people’s life course after the age of retirement: Whether they have moved geographically, whether they have experienced any major health issues or whether they have taken up, or ceased an economic activity. In addition, we are also interested in how these elements are related back to SEP and psychological resources in the first place. The theoretical framing of our work is given by the ongoing debate in poverty research whether the “traditional” dynamics of social stratification still apply. The underlying hypothesis for this question being that, in highly de-standardized and individualized societies, it is no longer people’s socio-economic position but above all the experience of critical life events - such as having experienced a divorce, the loss of a partner or having had children very early in the life course – that is the root cause of poverty. The relevance of this hypothesis for pensioners in Switzerland has been tested before but only using cross-sectional data.  It revealed that, among people in Switzerland born between  and , the main poverty dynamics are (still) related to social stratification. However, this previous study had the limitations of not being able to characterize poverty in terms of trajectories: whether it is structural or whether it fluctuates like in the professionally active population. Moreover, it did not look at the psychological factors such as personality traits or mental health; and neither did it consider the interlinkage between such psychological factors, SEP and the occurrence of life events. Using data from the gerontological survey “Vivre-Leben-Vivere” (VLV) which was conducted in  as well as the five-year follow up in , we will extend our previous research and we will assess how participant’s financial situation – operationalized in a binary poor vs. non-poor logic – has evolved between the two time-points. Mainly using logistic regression analysis and moderation analyses, we will test how socio-economic position in early and late adulthood, psychological resources and the experience of life events or specific life trajectories are associated with poverty-trajectories in old age. Our results will contribute to the discussion regarding the mechanisms of old-age poverty and hopefully will provide insight that is relevant beyond the specific socio-political setting of Switzerland.","doc_id":14239,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2827","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Assessing post-editing efficiency in a realistic translation environment","authors":"Läubli, Samuel; Fishel, Mark; Massey, Gary; Ehrensberger-Dow, Maureen; Volk, Martin","subject":"Post-editing; Translation-memory; Machine-translation; Translaiton;  Translationswissenschaft","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"418.02","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Assessing post-editing efficiency in a realistic translation environment; Post-editing; Translation-memory; Machine-translation; Translaiton;  Translationswissenschaft; In many experimental studies on assessing post-editing efficiency, idiosyncratic user interfaces isolate translators from translation aids that are available to them in their daily work.

Community birth options need to be expanded to meet demand among the next generation of maternity service users.","doc_id":14299,"prior":"health","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7573","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"How do women manage to remain healthy in pregnancy and postpartum","authors":"Künzli, Hansjörg; Dörrer-Letsch, A.; Felchlin, A.; Kammerer, E.; Kammerer, Martin","subject":"Pregnancy; Post-partum; Health; Cause Effect Relationships; Risk Factors; Mindfulness; Social network;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"158, 618","year":"2004","for_data_analysis":"How do women manage to remain healthy in pregnancy and postpartum; Pregnancy; Post-partum; Health; Cause Effect Relationships; Risk Factors; Mindfulness; Social network;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: It is suggested that the functioning of the social network, the partner relationship and the attitude towards pregnancy are important psychosocial factors causing risk or providing protection against social as well as mental health problems.

Although many studies about acid rock drainage have been performed, the dispersal of trace elements and their impact on the environment (groundwater, soils and agricultural use) and the long-term (i.e., decades to centuries) behaviour of mine tailings on silicate parent rock is still a matter of debate. Our main scope was, therefore, to develop an approach that enables a relatively fast and reliable prediction of the leaching of potentially toxic elements and, thus, to determine the reactivity of former mining sites. To do so, we traced back the leaching behaviour of metals such as copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in soils formed on tailings from small mines over a relatively long time period. Using a chronosequence approach based on historical records of mining activities and C- dating, element leaching could be traced over a time period of approximately  years for the historic mining sites at Mont Chemin (Switzerland). The weathering index B, that expresses chemical leaching of base cations and weathering of silicate minerals, and trace element ratios to immobile compounds (such as hafnium (Hf)) indicated that element leaching, and thus reactivity of the material, was very intense during the first  years after abandonment of the site. Between approximately – years, the rate of elemental change in the soils was strongly reduced tending (moderate reactivity) to very small values, and consequently low reactivity, for exposure ages of >  years. Thus, the chronosequence approach enabled to determine the reactivity of the sites. Soil organic carbon and oxyhydroxides were not effective enough to completely retain trace metals. Many former small mining sites exist in the Swiss Alps. Using a database that contains information about the period of activity, date of abandonment, elements used and geology, we extrapolated our findings to sites in Switzerland with moderately comparable conditions to Mont Chemin. This relatively simple empirical approach enabled a spatialisation and rough estimation of the sites regarding their reactivity. A large number of small mining sites in Switzerland were characterised as still highly reactive and only a few were considered to be weakly reactive. With the help of the chronosequence approach and extrapolation of the small former mining sites, a relatively fast overview of the reactivity of sites could be achieved. This approach, however, cannot substitute for a detailed risk analysis of such sites.","doc_id":14539,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"43","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15275","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Recombinant protein expression at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences Winterthur","authors":"Zaborosch, Christiane","subject":" Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2002","for_data_analysis":"Recombinant protein expression at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences Winterthur;  Biochemie; In recent years recombinant enzymes have found widespread application in industrial uses ranging from organic synthesis to food industry.

A hypothesis was proposed at the time, whereby hydrolysis of urea might neutralise the protons formed by deposition of CaCO, thereby enhancing the rate of calcification. However, since that early work the role of urea in coral metabolism has received little attention. We propose that the primary role of urea is to allow the coral-zooxanthellae association to take advantage of episodic peaks in nitrogen availability in an otherwise nutrient-poor environment. Urea would accumulate during times of nitrogen excess to be hydrolysed to release ammonium to the zooxanthellae in times of shortage. An increase in calcification rates could be a beneficial sideeffect of a pulsed nitrogen supply. Preliminary testing of this hypothesis has shown . that urea concentrations can be measured in a field laboratory using a colorimetric kit designed for use with human blood plasma . that urea concentrations increase significantly in corals exposed to ammonium pulses and return to those of control corals in low-ammonium seawater, . that calcification rates in corals exposed to a pulse of ammonium tend to increase relative to controls in low-nutrient seawater. We predict that, under conditions of chronically elevated nitrogen, if urea concentrations in the coral exceed a threshold level, then a decline in growth and health of the coral could follow. The levels of urea in coral tissue may provide another tool by which the nitrogen sufficiency of a coral might be monitored.","doc_id":14562,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19485","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"In vitro study of the anticancer effects of biotechnological extracts of the endangered plant species satureja khuzistanica","authors":"Khojasteh, Abbas; Metón, Isidoro; Camino, Sergio; Cusido, Rosa M.; Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Palazon, Javier","subject":"HepG2 human hepatoma cell; MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell; Satureja khuzistanica; Coronatine; Plant cell culture; Rosmarinic acid; Adenocarcinoma; Aziridine; Bioreactor; Caspase 8; Caspases; Cell culture technique; Cell cycle checkpoint; Cell line; Cell survival; Cinnamate; Cyclohexenes; Depside; Hep G2 cell; Human; MCF-7 cell; Phytochemical; Plant extract; Medicinal plants; Endangered specie; Tumor;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"In vitro study of the anticancer effects of biotechnological extracts of the endangered plant species satureja khuzistanica; HepG human hepatoma cell; MCF- human breast adenocarcinoma cell; Satureja khuzistanica; Coronatine; Plant cell culture; Rosmarinic acid; Adenocarcinoma; Aziridine; Bioreactor; Caspase ; Caspases; Cell culture technique; Cell cycle checkpoint; Cell line; Cell survival; Cinnamate; Cyclohexenes; Depside; Hep G cell; Human; MCF- cell; Phytochemical; Plant extract; Medicinal plants; Endangered specie; Tumor;  Technische Chemie; Many medicinal plant species are currently threatened in their natural habitats because of the growing demand for phytochemicals worldwide.

The failure to replicate research findings in psychology is a major scientific issue with important practical implications (Pashler & Harris, ), especially with respect to psychological interventions in people with serious mental health problems (Hengartner, ). The study by Pittelkow et al. () in this issue is thus timely and commendable. They offer a standardized approach based on Bayes factors (BFs) and subsequent qualitative evaluation to determine which intervention studies in clinical psychology have uncertain or questionable evidential support and are thus in need of replication. Overall, for .% of the statistically significant effects studied, the BFs indicated weak or no evidence for the claimed effect. As I detail below, this is likely an underestimate of the weakness of the evidence, since BFs do not take into account systematic research biases that inflate effect estimates.

Untersucht worden sind dabei Muster der sprachlichen Verständigung im öffentlichen Diskurs über Antibiotika und Antibiotikaresistenzen. Die Analysen erfolgten sowohl anhand eines deutsch- wie eines französischsprachigen Datenkorpus. Berücksichtigt wurden frei zugängliche Webtexte von Akteuren aus Politik, Medien, Gesundheitswesen und Wissenschaft. Wiederkehrende Muster der Verständigung im öffentlichen Diskurs können als sprachliche Form des «common sense» zu einem Thema verstanden werden. Dieser «common sense» ist eine wichtige Bezugsgrösse für übergreifende Kommunikations- und Diskursstrategien. Das gilt besonders für Akteure öffentlicher Governance, deren Strategien Akzeptanz finden und für Publikumsdiskurse anschlussfähig sein müssen.Analysen in zwei Sprachen: Eine Exploration erfolgte in deutscher Sprache, um die «kommunikative Infrastruktur» (Akteure, Ereignisse, Suchwörter usw.) des Diskursbereichs insgesamt identifizieren zu können. Darauf aufbauend sind zwei Datenkorpora erstellt worden. Ein deutschsprachiges Korpus mit . Mio. Texten bzw.  Mio. Wörtern von  Webquellen jener Organisationen, die für das Politikfeld und öffentliche Diskurse zur StAR als relevant eingestuft werden konnten. Un corpus francophone comportant ‘ textes (env. . Millions de mots) provenant de  sources du Web des organisations qui ont été classées comme pertinentes pour les discours francophone concernants StAR. Themen und Ereignisse: Die Analyse zeichnet das Bild eines vielfältigen, aber schwach ausgeprägten Spezialdiskurses über Antibiotikaresistenzen sowohl in Deutsch wie in Französisch. Antibiotikaresistenzen erscheinen als ein Spezialthema neben anderen Top-Themen, welche die untersuchten Akteure deutlich häufiger beschäftigen. Zu diesen anderen Themen gehören Krankheiten und Behandlungen im Allgemeinen und unabhängig von Antibiotika(resistenzen). Die journalistische Berichterstattung zu Antibiotika(resistenzen) ist in beiden untersuchten Sprachräumen deutlich auf Ereignisse und behördliche Informationsangebote bezogen.Diskursnetzwerke: Einzelne Akteure treten in unterschiedlicher Intensität auf. Zu den «Stars» in der Deutschschweiz zählen (von anderen häufig genannten) Akteure wie der Bundesrat und das BAG, die internationale World Health Organization (WHO), Swissmedic und die Universität Zürich. Parmi les « Stars » du discours francophone figurent outre l’OFSP, le Canton de Berne et l’OMS notamment les Hôpitaux de Suisse H+, la Fédération des médecins de Suisse (FMH), le Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois et Santésuisse.Als «Repräsentanten» gelten Akteure, die häufig auf andere Akteure verweisen. In der Deutschschweiz sind das bspw. die Basellandschaftliche Zeitung und  Minuten. Comme « représentants » du discours francophone fonctionnent les Cantons de Genève, Neuchâtel et Valais (Romandie). Santésuisse, SVP und die Unispitäler Basel und Zürich zählen als «Relais» zu jenen Akteuren, die in deutscher Sprache sowohl häufig genannt werden also auch andere häufig nennen. En Romandie, ce sont surtout des fédérations et des associations ainsi que les Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève qui font partie des «Relais».Public Stories, Kontroversen und Koalitionen: Die Diskurse erzählen zu ausgewählten Suchwörtern (wie «Antibiotika/-resistenzen«, «Forschung«, «Patienten«, «Wirkungen«, «infections», «bactéries») differenzierte Geschichten («Public Stories»).In der Deutschschweiz sind das Geschichten bspw. über die Bedeutung der Patientenverantwortung, über unterschiedliche Wirkungen und die Entwicklung (alternativer) Diagnose-, Behandlungs- und Therapieverfahren sowie über die Notwendigkeit, Forschende entsprechend zu fördern, zu vernetzen und motivieren. Les récits publics («Public Stories») des discours francophones sont également orientés sur la santé, les patients et les traitements. Ce discours comporte encore des récits spécifiques sur les infections et les bactéries, comme l’histoire d’un combat contre des infections antibiorésistantes ou à propos des résultats d’un nouvel antibiotique contre des germes résistants.Während in deutschsprachigen Diskursen Kontroversen über Antibiotika/Antibiotikaresistenzen geführt werden, fehlt eine breite Diskurskoalition, die sich auf eine allgemein verständliche sprachliche Symbolik für das Grundanliegen von StAR beziehen könnte. Der bisher dafür gewählte Begriff «One Health» hat sich nicht durchsetzen können. En revanche en Romandie, deux controverses ont été identifiées; l’une entre les médias et les destinataires des politiques publiques, l’autre plus substantielle entre le Canton de Neuchâtel et les prescripteurs comme l’OFSP ou Swissnoso. Contrairement à la Suisse alémanique, il existe visiblement une coalition forte entre les médias et le monde médical concernant la gestion du traitement des infections en milieu hospitalier. On ne dénombre aucune controverse ni coalition qui concerne l’antibiorésistance en soi.Fazits und Transfer: Die Ergebnisse zu beiden Sprachen zeigen, dass ein erst begrenzter, deutlich fachsprachlich gekennzeichneter «Spezialdiskurs» über Antibiotika(resistenzen) stattfindet, der künftig stärker und gezielter in übergreifende thematische Rahmen (wie Krankheiten, Umwelt, santé usw.) eingebettet werden sollte und könnte, um Kommunikationsziele von StAR zu erreichen. Dabei wäre auf die Entwicklung eines dafür geeigneten, leicht verständlichen Vokabulars zu achten, ebenso wie auf die Anknüpfung an sich entwickelnde «Public Stories».Die Ergebnisse der Diskursanalyse sind greifbar und nutzbar in interaktiven Visualisierungen (https://bit.ly/JTCr; Passwort: bagstar). Sie veranschaulichen die Erkenntnisse der Analysen, um den Wissenstransfer zu unterstützen und eine anschliessende, intern wie extern breit abgestützte Strategieentwicklung zu ermöglichen.","doc_id":14655,"prior":"Gesundheitspolitik","SDG3":1},{"id":"75","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5010","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Combining fMRI and DTI : a framework for exploring the limits of fMRI-guided DTI fiber tracking and for verifying DTI-based fiber tractography results","authors":"Stämpfli, Philipp; Reischauer, Caroline; Järmann, Thomas; Valavanis, A.; Kollias, S.; Boesiger, P.","subject":"Adult; Brain mapping; Corpus striatum; Evoked potentials, motor; Female; Humans; Image interpretation, computer-assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Motor cortex; Nerve fibers; Subtraction technique;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2008","for_data_analysis":"Combining fMRI and DTI : a framework for exploring the limits of fMRI-guided DTI fiber tracking and for verifying DTI-based fiber tractography results; Adult; Brain mapping; Corpus striatum; Evoked potentials, motor; Female; Humans; Image interpretation, computer-assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Motor cortex; Nerve fibers; Subtraction technique;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; A powerful, non-invasive technique for estimating and visualizing white matter tracts in the human brain in vivo is white matter fiber tractography that uses magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. The success of this method depends strongly on the capability of the applied tracking algorithm and the quality of the underlying data set. However, DTI-based fiber tractography still lacks standardized validation. In the present work, a combined fMRI/DTI study was performed, both to develop a setup for verifying fiber tracking results using fMRI-derived functional connections and to explore the limitations of fMRI based DTI fiber tracking. Therefore, a minor fiber bundle that features several fiber crossings and intersections was examined: The striatum and its connections to the primary motor cortex were examined by using two approaches to derive the somatotopic organization of the striatum. First, an fMRI-based somatotopic map of the striatum was reconstructed, based on fMRI activations that were provoked by unilateral motor tasks. Second, fMRI-guided DTI fiber tracking was performed to generate DTI-based somatotopic maps, using a standard line propagation and an advanced fast marching algorithm. The results show that the fiber connections reconstructed by the advanced fast marching algorithm are in good agreement with known anatomy, and that the DTI-revealed somatotopy is similar to the fMRI somatotopy. Furthermore, the study illustrates that the combination of fMRI with DTI can supply additional information in order to choose reasonable seed regions for generating functionally relevant networks and to validate reconstructed fibers.","doc_id":14680,"prior":"Krankheiten","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2185","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"In vivo confirmation of hydration-induced changes in human-skin thickness, roughness and interaction with the environment","authors":"Dabrowska, Agnieszka K.; Adlhart, Christian; Spano, Fabrizio; Rotaru, Gelu-Marius; Derler, Siegfried; Zhai, Lina; Spencer, Nicolas D.; Rossi, René M.","subject":"Skin; Raman spectra; Spectral properties; Three dimensional microscopy; Proteins;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"In vivo confirmation of hydration-induced changes in human-skin thickness, roughness and interaction with the environment; Skin; Raman spectra; Spectral properties; Three dimensional microscopy; Proteins;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Skin properties, structure and performance can be influenced by many internal and external factors, such as age, gender, lifestyle, skin diseases and a hydration level that can vary in relation to the environment.

The highest rates of water uptake were observed for the upper few μm of skin and for short exposure times.","doc_id":14698,"prior":"diseases","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17626","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Cost-effectiveness of price reductions in fortified powdered milk for the reduction of micronutrient deficiencies in 6-23 month old children in the Philippines","authors":"Wieser, Simon; Brunner, Beatrice; Plessow, Rafael; Eichler, Klaus; Malek, Olivia; Brügger, Urs","subject":" Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"362.1041","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Cost-effectiveness of price reductions in fortified powdered milk for the reduction of micronutrient deficiencies in - month old children in the Philippines;  Gesundheitsökonomie; Micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) are a major public health problem in the developing world and particularly harmful during early childhood.

Web-based patient narratives have become widely available on the internet and in social media, as part of electronically available patient decision aids or Web-based databases. In recent years, the role of patient narratives as a source of information, insight, and support for both health care users and providers has increasingly been emphasized. Although the potential impact of patient stories has high immediate plausibility, it is of interest to know if this impact can be captured in quantitative studies.Objective: This review aimed to evaluate whether research-generated Web-based patient narratives have quantifiable risks or benefits for (potential) patients, relatives, or health care professionals.Methods: We searched the following databases from August  to March : Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Titles and abstracts of the retrieved studies were reviewed and assessed for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Papers were included if they studied the following: () (potential) patients, relatives, or health care professionals; () the effects of Web-based patient narratives that were generated scientifically (eg, through qualitative research methods); and () were quantitative studies. Furthermore,  authors independently performed an assessment of the quality of the included studies using a validated checklist.Results: Of  documents,  studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies investigated  different sources of Web-based patient narratives. Sample sizes ranged from  to . The mean score of the quality assessment was . (range -). Effects regarding five different purposes were identified as follows: provide information, engage, model behavior, persuade, and comfort. We found positive effects in every category and negative effects in one category (persuade). Several of the reported effects are rather small or were identified under specific experimental conditions.Conclusions: Patient narratives seem to be a promising means to support users in improving their understanding of certain health conditions and possibly to provide emotional support and have an impact on behavioral changes. There is limited evidence for beneficial effects on some outcomes. However, narratives are characterized by considerable heterogeneity and the investigated outcomes are hardly comparable with each other, which makes the overall judgment difficult. As there are numerous possible measures and purposes of narratives, quantifying the impact of Web-based patient narratives remains a challenge. Future research is needed to define the optimal standards for quantitative approaches to narrative-based interventions.","doc_id":14814,"prior":"aids","SDG3":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4706","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Comparison of thermal dose concepts in human and animal patients","authors":"Weyland, Mathias; Eberle, B; Dressel, S; Timm, O; Puric, E; Rohrer Bley, C; Scheidegger, Stephan","subject":"Hyperthermia; Transient thermal dose equivalent; Cummulatibe equivalent minute;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"615, 616","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Comparison of thermal dose concepts in human and animal patients; Hyperthermia; Transient thermal dose equivalent; Cummulatibe equivalent minute;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":14857,"prior":"Medizin","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4706","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Comparison of thermal dose concepts in human and animal patients","authors":"Weyland, Mathias; Eberle, B; Dressel, S; Timm, O; Puric, E; Rohrer Bley, C; Scheidegger, Stephan","subject":"Hyperthermia; Transient thermal dose equivalent; Cummulatibe equivalent minute;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"615, 616","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Comparison of thermal dose concepts in human and animal patients; Hyperthermia; Transient thermal dose equivalent; Cummulatibe equivalent minute;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":14857,"prior":"Krankheiten","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20703","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Evaluating heart-hate variability, salivary cortisol and physical activity as predictors of cancer-related fatigue recovery in breast-cancer survivors over a 12 week period by use of a smartphone application","authors":"Seiler, Annina Julia; Klaas, Vanessa; Tröster, Gerhard; Murdock, Kyle W.; Chirinos, Diana A.; Garcini, Luz M.; Fagundes, Christopher P.","subject":"Cancer related fatigue; Heart-rate variability; Mobile health;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"616","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Evaluating heart-hate variability, salivary cortisol and physical activity as predictors of cancer-related fatigue recovery in breast-cancer survivors over a  week period by use of a smartphone application; Cancer related fatigue; Heart-rate variability; Mobile health;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Introduction Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating problems in breast cancer survivors (BCS) that can persist many years beyond successful cancer treatment.

Methods A total of  fatigued breast cancer survivors (FACIT-F score ≤ ) and  aged-matched female controls will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group.

Diese schwangeren Frauen haben eigene Bedürfnisse an die Fachpersonen in der Schwangerschaftsbetreuung.Ziel: Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist, physische maternale Risiken einer Oozytenspende-Schwangerschaft anhand evidenzbasierter Literatur darzulegen und Betreuungsschwerpunkte der Hebamme für die Schwangerschaftsbetreuung aufzuzeigen.Methode: Mittels einer theoretischen Literaturarbeit werden vier Publikationen bezüglich Risiken in Oozytenspende-Schwangerschaften analysiert und kritisch gewürdigt.Relevante Ergebnisse: Die vier Publikationen zeigen ein signifikant höheres Risiko von Oozytenspende-Empfängerinnen für hypertensive Erkrankungen in der Schwangerschaft bis Präeklampsie auf. Hingegen gibt es keine Hinweise für ein erhöhtes Risiko für Gestationsdiabetes und präpartale Blutungen im zweiten oder dritten Trimenon. Die Ergebnisse bezüglich Frühgeburtsbestrebungen und Blutungen im ersten Trimenon sind uneinheitlich.Schlussfolgerung. Anhand des Modells „A Birth Stool For The Midwife“ (Skinner, ) werden folgende Grundsätze für den Hebammenalltag abgeleitet:- ganzheitliche Sicht auf die Frau als Individuum- die schwangere Frau ist Expertin in ihrem Gebiet- intra- und interprofessionelle Zusammenarbeit- vermehrte Schwangerschaftskontrollen- Bewusstsein des erhöhten Risikos für hypertensive Erkrankungen in der Schwangerschaft- die Hebamme benötigt fundiertes Grundlagenwissen und sollte dieses laufend aktualisieren; Background: The number of pregnancies conceived using heterologous oocyte donation is increasing. During their pregnancy, these women do have distinct demands and requirements towards antenatal care.Aim: The aim of this paper is to determine maternal physical risks in pregnancies conceived after oocyte donation. Using the provided results, key aspects for midwives providing antenatal care are deduced.Methods: Four publications of authors spread among Europe regarding risks in pregnancies conceived by oocyte donation will be assessed via theoretical literature review.Results: The publications showed a significantly increased risk of pregnancy induced hypertension and preeclampsia in pregnancies conceived by oocyte donation. However, there was no evidence for higher risks regarding gestational diabetes and antenatal bleeding in the second or third trimester. There is inconsistent evidence considering the risk of preterm labour or antenatal bleeding in the first trimester.Conclusion: The following principles for midwives providing antenatal care were created in relation to the „ A Birth Stool For The Midwife” model by Skinner ():-  holistic approach towards the woman as an individual-  the pregnant woman is the expert in her field of experience - intra- and interprofessional collaboration-  added antenatal checks-  awareness of the increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancies- the midwife needs fundamental knowledge and constant informs","doc_id":14934,"prior":"diabetes","SDG3":1},{"id":"58","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1961","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Evaluation of estrogenic activity of Trifolium pratense L. and Cimicifuga racemosa L. plant extracts and formulations using the planar-YES assay","authors":"Bräm, Sarah; Wolfram, Evelyn","subject":" Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Biotechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"615, 660.6","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Evaluation of estrogenic activity of Trifolium pratense L. and Cimicifuga racemosa L. plant extracts and formulations using the planar-YES assay;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Biotechnologie; Supplementation with natural estrogens, known as phytoestrogens are desirable for the treatment of women suffering from climacteric complaints after menopause. However, in patients with hormone-dependent cancers, such as specific types of breast cancer, the intake of phytoestrogens may be contraindicated, since some compounds are claimed to trigger the formation of metastasis-initiating cancer cells [].HPTLC is an analytical tool in quality control of medicinal plants extracts. Separated compounds from multicompound extracts are fixed on the solid silica phase like a compound library. By direct coupling of the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) on the HPTLC plate, this compound library can also be used for screening of estrogenic activity.The reporter gene YES assay encoding the human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was adapted for the screening of Trifolium pratensis L. and Cimcifuga racemosa L. extracts and formulations [,]. The method is rapid and simple with no need for special sample preparation. Excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinyl pyrrolidone did not interfere with the method.In samples of T. pratensis, pronounced fluorescent zones of Genistein and Biochanin A could be identified, indicating estrogen receptor affinity.

Driven by market needs, and, in particular, by the developers and manufacturers of drugs, vaccines, and further biologicals, there has been a trend toward the use of disposable seed bioreactors as well as production bioreactors. Numerous studies documenting their advantages in use have contributed to further new developments and have resulted in the availability of a multitude of disposable bioreactor types which differ in power input, design, instrumentation, and scale of the cultivation container. In this review, the term “disposable bioreactor” is defined, the benefits and constraints of disposable bioreactors are discussed, and critical phases and milestones in the development of disposable bioreactors are summarized. An overview of the disposable bioreactors that are currently commercially available is provided, and the domination of wave-mixed, orbitally shaken, and, in particular, stirred disposable bioreactors in animal cell-derived productions at cubic meter scale is reported. The growth of this type of reactor system is attributed to the recent availability of stirred disposable benchtop systems such as the Mobius CellReady  L Bioreactor. Analysis of the data from computational fluid dynamic simulation studies and first cultivation runs confirms that this novel bioreactor system is a viable alternative to traditional cell culture bioreactors at benchtop scale.","doc_id":15014,"prior":"vaccines","SDG3":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21044","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Psychische Gesundheit fördern! : Projekte für Schulkinder und junge Erwachsene","authors":"Wieber, Frank; von Wyl, Agnes","subject":"Mental health; Child and adolescent health; Health promotion; Primary care setting;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Persönliche Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"305, 613","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Psychische Gesundheit fördern! : Projekte für Schulkinder und junge Erwachsene; Mental health; Child and adolescent health; Health promotion; Primary care setting;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Persönliche Gesundheit","doc_id":15076,"prior":"Psychische Gesundheit","SDG3":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21902","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Unraveling the deep learning gearbox in optical coherence tomography image segmentation towards explainable artificial intelligence","authors":"Maloca, Peter M.; Müller, Philipp L.; Lee, Aaron Y.; Tufail, Adnan; Balaskas, Konstantinos; Niklaus, Stephanie; Kaiser, Pascal; Suter, Susanne; Zarranz-Ventura, Javier; Egan, Catherine; Scholl, Hendrik P.

An overall average variability of .% between the human graders and the algorithm was found, slightly minor to .% among human graders. The ambiguity in ground truth had noteworthy impact on machine learning results, which could be visualized.

We examined the impact of TSA on quality of life (QOL), direct medical costs and productivity losses, and evaluated the cost-utility ratio of TSA compared to ongoing nonoperative management using real-world data.Methods: Patients with shoulder osteoarthritis and/or rotator cuff tear arthropathy indicated for anatomical or reverse TSA were included in this prospective study. Quality of life (EQ-D-L) and shoulder function (Constant Score, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire, Subjective Shoulder Value) were assessed before (preop) and up to  years after surgery (postop). Health insurance companies provided all-diagnoses direct medical costs for  in Swiss francs (CHF), where  CHF was equivalent to . USD. Indirect costs were assessed using the work productivity and activity impairment questionnaire. Baseline data at recruitment and the total costs of the preop year served as a proxy for nonoperative management. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the total costs to gain one extra quality-adjusted life year (QALY) based on both the health care system and societal perspective. The relationship between QOL and shoulder function was assessed by regression analysis.Results: The mean preOP EQ-D-L utility index of . for a total of  patients (mean age  years; % working; % female) increased to . and . at  and  years postop, respectively. Mean direct medical costs were , CHF (preop), , CHF ( year postop) and , CHF ( years postop). The ICER was , CHF/QALY (% confidence interval [CI]: ,; ,). Mean productivity losses for  working patients decreased from , CHF per patient (preop) to , CHF at  year postop and , CHF at  years postop. When considering these productivity losses, the ICER was , CHF/QALY (% CI: ,; ,). Quality of life was significantly associated with shoulder function (p < .).Conclusion: Using real-world direct medical cost data, we calculated a cost-utility ratio of , CHF/QALY for TSA in Switzerland, which clearly falls below the often suggested , CHF/QALY threshold for acceptable cost-effectiveness. In view of productivity losses, TSA becomes highly cost-effective with an ICER of , CHF/QALY.","doc_id":15181,"prior":"health policy","SDG3":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20784","date":"2020","language":"de; en","title":"Eine Umfrage über die ergotherapeutische Zusammenarbeit mit Schulen","authors":"Rathauscher, Ulrike; Van Nes, Fenna; Kramer-Roy, Debbie; Gantschnig, Brigitte","subject":"Ergotherapie; Schule; Umfrage; Occupational therapy; School; Survey;  Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten;  Ergotherapie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"371, 615.8515","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Eine Umfrage über die ergotherapeutische Zusammenarbeit mit Schulen; Occupational therapy and collaboration with schools : results from an online survey in Austria; Ergotherapie; Schule; Umfrage; Occupational therapy; School; Survey;  Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten;  Ergotherapie; Einleitung: Der Weltverband der Ergotherapeuten sieht die inklusive Bildung als vorrangiges, nicht verhandelbares Recht.

In early , the COVID- pandemic started to sweep over on a global scale. As a result, infection numbers rose and death tolls did too. Consequently, governments across the world were forced to take measures to limit further spread. In doing so, European football was almost completely brought to a halt for several weeks. Thus, revenue streams of football clubs were affected and the clubs had to ensure economic viability. The main objective of the thesis was to explore the crisis management measures employed by European football clubs in the context of the COVID-. In doing so, best practices were established that could be used for football clubs’ crisis management efforts in the future. The research was conducted employing primary and secondary data collection processes. The former was carried out by means of ten interviews with club representatives of football clubs from various countries, three expert interviews in the fields of sports management, as well as crisis management and communication, and through a survey. The survey was primarily utilized to underline the findings of secondary data in describing the general situation, while the interviews were used to examine the measures employed by football clubs across Europe to overcome the COVID- pandemic. Thereby, the Business Model Canvas was used to display the implications of the crisis, and the three phases of crisis management were employed to outline the measures taken in the respective stage. In doing so, various best practices were mentioned that can be useful when being faced with a crisis like the COVID- pandemic. Results showed that football clubs should identify, assess and possibly mitigate the risk. Furthermore, scenario planning shall be performed to recognize possible scenarios while constantly extending and adapting them throughout the crisis phase. With business continuity plans, football clubs can ensure the continuous operation of a football club despite certain threats. In the pre-crisis phase, football clubs should establish or revitalize a crisis management team in charge of coordinating and communicating through the crisis. The importance of internal communication emerged from the research as well. Thus, direct and regular contact can help prevent uncertainty amongst employees. Given a health-related crisis, like the COVID- pandemic, football clubs need to implement and communicate the guidelines issued by the public health authorities. In the crisis phase, the continuation of particular previously introduced is advised, such as all health-related measures, the steering by the crisis response team, and the continuous scenario planning. If available, football clubs should request financial support from the government. Further, conducting an investment stop is advised. When performing the cost analysis, football clubs should be aware of possible new costs due to the given crisis while being on the lookout to identify cost drivers that can be neutralized. When it is concluded that personnel-related expenses need to be lowered, the results of this paper indicated that reviewing the bonus system and introducing temporary pay cuts are preferred to layoffs, which would likely lead to uncertainty and the loss of know-how for the recovery phase. Especially if personnel costs are targeted, active internal communication should explain the situation and update with new information. Given the importance of sponsorship revenue for football clubs, it was found that a strategy is needed for sponsors. Thereby, communication, compensation, and commitment shall be at the center of attention. Since the uniqueness of the connection between fans and football clubs, a similar strategy is strongly recommended. Thus, football clubs should communicate, find ways to compensate, and help the community. Lastly, every crisis also entails its opportunities. For this reason, football clubs should start looking for opportunities in the crisis phase – either within the field of football or outside it. In a crisis such as the COVID- pandemic, which lasts for an extended period of time, football clubs should review and implement the relevant lessons learned after each pandemic wave. Also, it is advised to evaluate the crisis response and change projects. Active internal communication is also of vital importance in the last of the three phases. Through examining the measures employed by football clubs in response to the COVID- pandemic’s implications, and suggested by experts, the overview of best practices for each of the three phases was summarized. Due to the wide geographical range of the football clubs, various insights could be gained. Yet, comparability was only limited because of different contexts. For this reason, it was suggested that future research should increase comparability through allocating football clubs in groups according to specific factors, such as country. Further limitations and future research suggestions were described.","doc_id":15271,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2288","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The detrimental impact of maladaptive personality on public mental health : a challenge for psychiatric practice","authors":"Hengartner, Michael Pascal","subject":"Review; Personality; Epidemiology; Psychopathology; Psychiatric practice; Public health; Personality disorders; Nosology;  Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"155, 616.89","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"The detrimental impact of maladaptive personality on public mental health : a challenge for psychiatric practice; Review; Personality; Epidemiology; Psychopathology; Psychiatric practice; Public health; Personality disorders; Nosology;  Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie; Experts in personality psychology and personality disorders have long emphasized the pervasive and persistent detrimental impact of maladaptive personality traits on mental health and functioning. However, in routine psychiatric practice, maladaptive personality is readily ignored and personality traits are seldom incorporated into clinical guidelines. The aim of this narrative review is to outline how pervasively personality influences public mental health and how personality thereby challenges common psychiatric practice. A comprehensive search and synthesis of the scientific literature demonstrates that maladaptive personality traits and personality disorders, in particular high neuroticism and negative affectivity, first, are risk factors for divorce, unemployment, and disability pensioning; second, relate to the prevalence, incidence, and co-occurrence of common mental disorders; third, impair functioning, symptom remission, and recovery in co-occurring common mental disorders; and fourth, predispose to treatment resistance, non-response and poor treatment outcome. In conclusion, maladaptive personality is not only involved in the development and course of mental disorders but also predisposes to chronicity and re-occurrence of psychopathology and reduces the efficacy of psychiatric treatments. The pernicious impact of maladaptive personality on mental health and functioning demands that careful assessment and thorough consideration of personality should be compulsory in psychiatric practice.","doc_id":15289,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"44","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21820","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Antiviral screen against canine distemper virus-induced membrane fusion activity","authors":"Shrestha, Neeta; Gall, Flavio; Vesin, Jonathan; Chambon, Marc; Turcatti, Gerardo; Fotiadis, Dimitrios; Riedl, Rainer; Plattet, Philippe","subject":"CDV; Cell-based fusion assay; Envelope glycoproteins; Host cell receptor; Inhibitor discovery;  Mikrobiologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"579","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Antiviral screen against canine distemper virus-induced membrane fusion activity; CDV; Cell-based fusion assay; Envelope glycoproteins; Host cell receptor; Inhibitor discovery;  Mikrobiologie; Canine distemper virus (CDV), a close relative of the human pathogen measles virus (MeV), is an enveloped, negative sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Morbillivirus and causes severe diseases in dogs and other carnivores.

Accordingly, information and consent represent a complex procedure, and the participant concerned “must receive comprehensible oral and written information” (Swiss legislation: Human Research Act (HRA) Art. ). A triangle of stakeholders is involved in the procedure: ethics committees that review and approve research projects and Informed Consent (IC) documents, medical researchers who produce the documents and discuss enrolment with patients, and patients who have to be informed comprehensibly. From a linguistic point of view, the question arises as to which perceptions of comprehensibility form the basis of the IC process and how shared language can be established considering the complex relationship between these stakeholders. This contribution presents findings from two perspectives (ethics committees and researchers) while considering the needs of all three stakeholders. Firstly, the conceptualisation of comprehensibility among three ethic committees is presented, and steps toward harmonisation are outlined. Secondly, limitations of how researchers conduct oral IC information are analysed, and the measures that were implemented to improve patient information are discussed. A transdisciplinary approach is key in establishing these solutions because they do not stem from linguistic analysis alone but have been developed in close collaboration with members of ethics committees and medical researchers. Thus, the project shows how the expertise of applied linguistics in cooperation with practitioners can deliver an important impact in both academic analysis and optimisation of professional procedures.","doc_id":15403,"prior":"Gesundheitskommunikation","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"39","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14212","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"2018 EULAR recommendations for physical activity in people with inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis","authors":"Niedermann Schneider, Karin","subject":"Rehabilitation; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Spondyloarthritis; Hip Osteoarthritis; Knee Osteoarthritis;  Physiotherapie;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"615.82, 616.7","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":" EULAR recommendations for physical activity in people with inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis; Rehabilitation; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Spondyloarthritis; Hip Osteoarthritis; Knee Osteoarthritis;  Physiotherapie;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie; Objective: Regular physical activity (PA) is increasingly promoted for people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases as well as the general population.

Berufsverbot). Sexarbeiter*innen werden gesellschaftlich und politisch als besondere Risikogruppe identifiziert. Nebst den gesundheitlichen Risiken führt die Pandemie zu finanziellen Problemen. Wenn das Einkommen wegfällt, kein Vermögen vorhanden ist und der Zugang zu staatlichen Erwerbsersatzansprüche (Sozialhilfe oder Ansprüche aus diversen Sozialversicherungen) eingeschränkt oder verunmöglicht ist, z.B. aufgrund des Aufenthaltsstatus, drohen schnell Mittellosigkeit und Wohnungsverlust. Mediale und politische Stigmatisierung sowie soziale Isolation erhöhen die Belastung zusätzlich.ZieleDas Forschungsprojekt „Sexwork und Corona“ untersucht im Kontext der politischen Massnahmen zur Eindämmung des Coronavirus deren Auswirkungen auf die Lebenslage von Sexarbeiter*innen in der Stadt Zürich, die Lebensbewältigungsstrategien, welche sie in der Pandemie entwickelt haben, und was dies für die Wirksamkeit der Massnahmen zu Bekämpfung der Pandemie bedeutet.MethodeIm empirischen Teil der Untersuchung wurden im April   Fachpersonen aus Organisationen befragt, welche mit Sexarbeiter*innen als Zielklientel arbeiten und diese während der Corona-Pandemie unterstützt haben. Anhand der Aussagen der Fachpersonen konnten erste Erkenntnisse zu den Lebenslagen, Lebenswelten und der Lebensbewältigung von Sexarbeiter*innen festgehalten werden. Zudem ermöglichten diese Gespräche eine erste Einschätzung der Narrative im öffentlichen Diskurs über Sexarbeit und Corona. Im Weiteren lieferten sie Informationen über die Auswirkungen der Massnahmen auf die soziale und medizinische Unterstützung von Sexarbeiter*innen und über die deshalb erfolgten Angebotsanpassungen. Danach wurden  Sexarbeiter*innen befragt. Dabei variierten Geschlecht (Frauen, Männer, Trans), Aufenthaltsstatus (Sans-Papiers, -Tage-Visum für selbstständig erwerbstätige EU-Bürger*innen, Niederlassung B oder C, Schweizer Bürgerschaft), Herkunft (Schweiz, Deutschland, Osteuropa, ehemaliges Jugoslawien, Südeuropa, Südamerika), Art und Form der ausgeübten Sexarbeit (Strassensexarbeit, Escort, Club/Bordell/Salon, Domina). Für ein Interview nicht erreicht werden konnten Sexarbeiter*innen aus Afrika. Die Interviews basierten auf einem Leitfaden und wurden ausnahmslos vor Ort durchgeführt. Teilweise wurden die Interviews durch Fachpersonen übersetzt oder von den Interviewerinnen in einer anderen Sprache als Deutsch geführt.Dem empirischen Teil wurden eine Literaturanalyse und eine Analyse der politischen Vorstösse vorangestellt.ErgebnisDie vorliegende Untersuchung folgte dem Ansatz, Lebenslage, Lebenswelt und Lebensbewältigungsstrategien von Sexarbeiter*innen während der Corona-Pandemie im Kanton Zürich zu untersuchen. Das Konzept folgt der Definition von Björn Kraus (), der sich dabei auf eine etablierte Theorie innerhalb der Sozialen Arbeit von Hans Thiersch und Lothar Bönisch bezieht. Die sogenannte Lebensweltorientierung formuliert die These, dass sozialarbeiterische Interventionen wirkungsvoller sind, wenn sie sich an der Lebenswelt der Adressat*innen orientieren. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde diese Prämisse auf gesundheitspolitische Regulierungen während der Corona-Pandemie im Kanton Zürich angewendet. Die Frage war, ob die kantonalen Massnahmen gegen die Corona-Pandemie im Sexgewerbe auf Lebenslage, Lebenswelt und Lebensbewältigungsmöglichkeiten von Sexarbeiter*innen abgestimmt waren. Die Antwort lautet: Nein, es wurde nicht beachtet, dass Massnahmen, die für die breite Bevölkerung gedacht waren, wie z.B. die Registrierungspflicht, bei einer bestimmten Zielgruppe in einer besonderen Lebenslage nicht funktionieren oder sogar kontraproduktiv wirken würden.In den Interviews mit Sexarbeiter*innen und Fachpersonen zeigte sich, dass die Vulnerabilität von Sexarbeiter*Innen durch die Coronakrise multidimensional bedingt war. Es waren Kombinationen verschiedener Faktoren, welche die individuelle Lebenslage, ihre Deutung und die Möglichkeiten zur Lebensbewältigung bestimmten. So kann nicht davon ausgegangen werden, dass nur einzelne spezifische Faktoren (z.B. Geschlecht, Aufenthaltsstatus, Arbeitsort) die erhöhte Vulnerabilität ausmachen, sondern diese als Zusammenspiel verschiedener Dimensionen aufeinander einwirken.EmpfehlungenDie empirischen Daten haben gezeigt, dass Sexarbeiter*innen stark von den Massnahmen betroffen waren, an deren Ausarbeitung sie nicht beteiligt waren. Gefässe zu installieren, an welchen Betroffene sowie Fachstellen mitwirken können, um Massnahmen zu formulieren, ist unter diesem Gesichtspunkt eine erste Empfehlung. Mitwirkung kann sowohl die Effektivität als auch die Akzeptanz solcher Massnahmen erhöhen. Auch der Austausch von Informationen und Ideen zwischen Stadt, Kanton, Bund und Fachstellen, wie etwa ein runder Tisch, wäre hilfreich gewesen.Grundsätzlich wird empfohlen, in einem ähnlichen Fall kein Berufsverbot auszusprechen und auch nicht allgemeine Hygienebestimmungen unabhängig von der besonderen Situation aus das Sexgewerbe zu übertragen. Die negativen Effekte überwiegen die positiven, insbesondere beim Versuch des Contact-Tracings mittel Registrierung der Freier. Es wäre sinnvoller, Massnahmen zu entwickeln, die auf die Situation im Sexgewerbe abgestimmt sind und darum auch umgesetzt werden können. Dazu bedarf es einer ernsthaften Auseinandersetzung der zuständigen Behörden mit Lebenslage, Lebenswelt und Lebensbewältigungsfähigkeiten von Sexarbeiter*innen. Das kann auch im Austausch mit involvierten Sozialarbeiter*innen oder Fachstellen erfolgen.Bei einer Einschränkung der Berufsausübung, wie dies beim Arbeitsverbot der Fall war, muss der daraus entstanden Erwerbsausfall systematisch ersetzt werden. Wird dies wie im vorliegenden Fall nicht oder bloss punktuell gemacht, entwickeln die verschiedenen Beteiligten ihre eigenen Überlebensstrategien. Das kann den eigentlichen Zielen des Arbeitsverbotes zuwiderlaufen und kontraproduktive Effekte erzeugen.Die Hilfen sollten unbürokratisch, umfassend und insbesondere nachhaltig ausgerichtet werden. Finanzielle Hilfen konnten zwar während der Pandemie durch Fachstellen ausbezahlt werden, zeigten sich jedoch nicht als nachhaltig bzw. reichten nicht für alle, die Anspruch gehabt hätten. Die Fachstellen gerieten durch die Rollenerweiterung in eine kontrollierende Rolle, was für den eigentlichen Auftrag hinderlich sein kann. Weil der Regierungsrat das Verbot verordnet hat, die Unterstützung von Sexarbeiter*innen aber Kommunen und Privaten überlassen hat, war die Situation unübersichtlich und unkoordiniert.Sowohl die gesetzlichen Bestimmungen als auch ihr Vollzug müssen einheitlich und koordiniert sein. Weder das Eine noch das Andere war während der Corona-Pandemie der Fall. Die kantonalen Regelungen waren extrem unterschiedlich, sodass es zu Verlagerungen von einem Kanton in andere kam. Und auch der Vollzug war im Kanton Zürich disparat und unübersichtlich. Das erhöhte die Wirkung der Massnahmen keinesfalls.Der Eindruck schlecht koordinierten Vorgehens entstand nicht nur in Bezug auf die Durchsetzung des Verbotes. Auch bei den unterstützenden Organisationen mangelte es zuweilen an gegenseitiger Information und Absprachen.

Wenn das Einkommen wegfällt, kein Vermögen vorhanden ist und der Zugang zu staatlichen Erwerbsersatzansprüche (Sozialhilfe oder Ansprüche aus diversen Sozialversicherungen) eingeschränkt oder verunmöglicht ist, z.B. aufgrund des Aufenthaltsstatus, drohen schnell Mittellosigkeit und Wohnungsverlust. Mediale und politische Stigmatisierung sowie soziale Isolation erhöhen die Belastung zusätzlich.ZieleDas Forschungsprojekt „Sexwork und Corona“ untersucht im Kontext der politischen Massnahmen zur Eindämmung des Coronavirus deren Auswirkungen auf die Lebenslage von Sexarbeiter*innen in der Stadt Zürich, die Lebensbewältigungsstrategien, welche sie in der Pandemie entwickelt haben, und was dies für die Wirksamkeit der Massnahmen zu Bekämpfung der Pandemie bedeutet.MethodeIm empirischen Teil der Untersuchung wurden im April   Fachpersonen aus Organisationen befragt, welche mit Sexarbeiter*innen als Zielklientel arbeiten und diese während der Corona-Pandemie unterstützt haben. Anhand der Aussagen der Fachpersonen konnten erste Erkenntnisse zu den Lebenslagen, Lebenswelten und der Lebensbewältigung von Sexarbeiter*innen festgehalten werden. Zudem ermöglichten diese Gespräche eine erste Einschätzung der Narrative im öffentlichen Diskurs über Sexarbeit und Corona. Im Weiteren lieferten sie Informationen über die Auswirkungen der Massnahmen auf die soziale und medizinische Unterstützung von Sexarbeiter*innen und über die deshalb erfolgten Angebotsanpassungen. Danach wurden  Sexarbeiter*innen befragt. Dabei variierten Geschlecht (Frauen, Männer, Trans), Aufenthaltsstatus (Sans-Papiers, -Tage-Visum für selbstständig erwerbstätige EU-Bürger*innen, Niederlassung B oder C, Schweizer Bürgerschaft), Herkunft (Schweiz, Deutschland, Osteuropa, ehemaliges Jugoslawien, Südeuropa, Südamerika), Art und Form der ausgeübten Sexarbeit (Strassensexarbeit, Escort, Club/Bordell/Salon, Domina). Für ein Interview nicht erreicht werden konnten Sexarbeiter*innen aus Afrika. Die Interviews basierten auf einem Leitfaden und wurden ausnahmslos vor Ort durchgeführt. Teilweise wurden die Interviews durch Fachpersonen übersetzt oder von den Interviewerinnen in einer anderen Sprache als Deutsch geführt.Dem empirischen Teil wurden eine Literaturanalyse und eine Analyse der politischen Vorstösse vorangestellt.ErgebnisDie vorliegende Untersuchung folgte dem Ansatz, Lebenslage, Lebenswelt und Lebensbewältigungsstrategien von Sexarbeiter*innen während der Corona-Pandemie im Kanton Zürich zu untersuchen. Das Konzept folgt der Definition von Björn Kraus (), der sich dabei auf eine etablierte Theorie innerhalb der Sozialen Arbeit von Hans Thiersch und Lothar Bönisch bezieht. Die sogenannte Lebensweltorientierung formuliert die These, dass sozialarbeiterische Interventionen wirkungsvoller sind, wenn sie sich an der Lebenswelt der Adressat*innen orientieren. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde diese Prämisse auf gesundheitspolitische Regulierungen während der Corona-Pandemie im Kanton Zürich angewendet. Die Frage war, ob die kantonalen Massnahmen gegen die Corona-Pandemie im Sexgewerbe auf Lebenslage, Lebenswelt und Lebensbewältigungsmöglichkeiten von Sexarbeiter*innen abgestimmt waren. Die Antwort lautet: Nein, es wurde nicht beachtet, dass Massnahmen, die für die breite Bevölkerung gedacht waren, wie z.B. die Registrierungspflicht, bei einer bestimmten Zielgruppe in einer besonderen Lebenslage nicht funktionieren oder sogar kontraproduktiv wirken würden.In den Interviews mit Sexarbeiter*innen und Fachpersonen zeigte sich, dass die Vulnerabilität von Sexarbeiter*Innen durch die Coronakrise multidimensional bedingt war. Es waren Kombinationen verschiedener Faktoren, welche die individuelle Lebenslage, ihre Deutung und die Möglichkeiten zur Lebensbewältigung bestimmten. So kann nicht davon ausgegangen werden, dass nur einzelne spezifische Faktoren (z.B. Geschlecht, Aufenthaltsstatus, Arbeitsort) die erhöhte Vulnerabilität ausmachen, sondern diese als Zusammenspiel verschiedener Dimensionen aufeinander einwirken.EmpfehlungenDie empirischen Daten haben gezeigt, dass Sexarbeiter*innen stark von den Massnahmen betroffen waren, an deren Ausarbeitung sie nicht beteiligt waren. Gefässe zu installieren, an welchen Betroffene sowie Fachstellen mitwirken können, um Massnahmen zu formulieren, ist unter diesem Gesichtspunkt eine erste Empfehlung. Mitwirkung kann sowohl die Effektivität als auch die Akzeptanz solcher Massnahmen erhöhen. Auch der Austausch von Informationen und Ideen zwischen Stadt, Kanton, Bund und Fachstellen, wie etwa ein runder Tisch, wäre hilfreich gewesen.Grundsätzlich wird empfohlen, in einem ähnlichen Fall kein Berufsverbot auszusprechen und auch nicht allgemeine Hygienebestimmungen unabhängig von der besonderen Situation aus das Sexgewerbe zu übertragen. Die negativen Effekte überwiegen die positiven, insbesondere beim Versuch des Contact-Tracings mittel Registrierung der Freier. Es wäre sinnvoller, Massnahmen zu entwickeln, die auf die Situation im Sexgewerbe abgestimmt sind und darum auch umgesetzt werden können. Dazu bedarf es einer ernsthaften Auseinandersetzung der zuständigen Behörden mit Lebenslage, Lebenswelt und Lebensbewältigungsfähigkeiten von Sexarbeiter*innen. Das kann auch im Austausch mit involvierten Sozialarbeiter*innen oder Fachstellen erfolgen.Bei einer Einschränkung der Berufsausübung, wie dies beim Arbeitsverbot der Fall war, muss der daraus entstanden Erwerbsausfall systematisch ersetzt werden. Wird dies wie im vorliegenden Fall nicht oder bloss punktuell gemacht, entwickeln die verschiedenen Beteiligten ihre eigenen Überlebensstrategien. Das kann den eigentlichen Zielen des Arbeitsverbotes zuwiderlaufen und kontraproduktive Effekte erzeugen.Die Hilfen sollten unbürokratisch, umfassend und insbesondere nachhaltig ausgerichtet werden. Finanzielle Hilfen konnten zwar während der Pandemie durch Fachstellen ausbezahlt werden, zeigten sich jedoch nicht als nachhaltig bzw. reichten nicht für alle, die Anspruch gehabt hätten. Die Fachstellen gerieten durch die Rollenerweiterung in eine kontrollierende Rolle, was für den eigentlichen Auftrag hinderlich sein kann. Weil der Regierungsrat das Verbot verordnet hat, die Unterstützung von Sexarbeiter*innen aber Kommunen und Privaten überlassen hat, war die Situation unübersichtlich und unkoordiniert.Sowohl die gesetzlichen Bestimmungen als auch ihr Vollzug müssen einheitlich und koordiniert sein. Weder das Eine noch das Andere war während der Corona-Pandemie der Fall. Die kantonalen Regelungen waren extrem unterschiedlich, sodass es zu Verlagerungen von einem Kanton in andere kam. Und auch der Vollzug war im Kanton Zürich disparat und unübersichtlich. Das erhöhte die Wirkung der Massnahmen keinesfalls.Der Eindruck schlecht koordinierten Vorgehens entstand nicht nur in Bezug auf die Durchsetzung des Verbotes. Auch bei den unterstützenden Organisationen mangelte es zuweilen an gegenseitiger Information und Absprachen. Insbesondere hätte man sich arbeitsteilig organisieren und so die vorhandenen Ressourcen gezielter ausschöpfen können.","doc_id":15537,"prior":"Gesundheitsförderung","posterior":"Zugang","SDG3":1},{"id":"84","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16869","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Like a Swiss watch? : measuring the effects of a lean implementation at Bern university hospital","authors":"Brand, Tim; Angerer, Alfred; Schmelzer, Sarah","subject":"Evaluation; Lean management; Hospital;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362.11","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Like a Swiss watch? : measuring the effects of a lean implementation at Bern university hospital; Evaluation; Lean management; Hospital;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen; Background: Since Lean management found its way into the healthcare system several years ago, many hospitals have started to implement the Lean management philosophy in their work environments. However, although Lean implementation requires an extensive amount of resources, its effects on hospital key performance indicators (KPIs) are largely unknown because very few hospitals conduct measurements during the implementation process to quantify the effects of such interventions. Aim: To quantify the effects of Lean implementation in a department of Bern University Hospital in Switzerland regarding financial, human, and process factors. Data and Method: The data were collected during two measurement phases before and after the implementation of a Lean approach in March/April  and October/November . Data resources were the hospital’s IT systems as well as an employee satisfaction survey and process measurements. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS. Results: No significant differences were found between pre- and post-assessment in terms of the controlling data assessed. Number of interruptions and walking distance assessed in onsite observations decreased. Employee satisfaction decreased, with significant differences for some items. While the proportions of the different tasks in the working processes varied, the amount of time spent with patients remained almost unchanged. Patient satisfaction remained at a high level. Contribution to Public Management: Lean implementation is a strategy to address financial pressure in hospitals by creating a more efficient work environment. Our study offers new insights into the effects of Lean implementation on hospital KPIs. We developed a framework to evaluate Lean projects. In addition, we identified obstacles that could reduce the effects of the Lean implementation we evaluated and make recommendations on how to make future projects more effective. In this context, the project supports activities combatting the rise in global healthcare costs.","doc_id":15544,"prior":"healthcare","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24744","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Confident and altruistic – parents' motives to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 : a cross-sectional online survey in a Swiss vaccination centre","authors":"Wagner, Aylin; Liberatore, Florian; Schmelzer, Sarah; Dratva, Julia","subject":"Survey study; COVID-19; Vaccination; Switzerland; Parents;  Psychologie;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"150, 614","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Confident and altruistic – parents' motives to vaccinate their children against COVID- : a cross-sectional online survey in a Swiss vaccination centre; Survey study; COVID-; Vaccination; Switzerland; Parents;  Psychologie;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; In Switzerland, COVID- vaccines have been approved for children aged - years only recently, whereas vaccination of adolescents aged  years and older was approved in early summer .

Since March , measures have been evolving and include a mixture of central and federalistic mitigation strategies across three culturally diverse language regions. The present study investigates a hypothesised heterogeneity in health, social behavior and adherence to mitigation measures across the language regions by studying pre-specified interaction effects. Our findings aim to support the communication of regionally targeted mitigation strategies and to provide evidence to address longterm population-health consequences of the pandemic by accounting for different pandemic contexts and cultural aspects.MethodsWe use data from from the COVID- Social Monitor, a longitudinal population-based online survey. We define five mitigation periods between March  and May . We use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate a hypothesized interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions on selected study outcomes covering the domains of general health and quality of life, mental health, loneliness/isolation, physical activity, health care use and adherence to mitigation measures.ResultsWe analyze , (%) participants from the German/Romansh-speaking part of Switzerland,  (%) from the French-speaking part and  (%) from the Italian-speaking part. We found evidence for an interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions for adherence to mitigation measures, but not for other study outcomes (social behavior, health). The presence of poor quality of life, lack of energy, no physical activity, health care use, and the adherence to mitigation measures changed similarly over mitigation periods in all language regions.DiscussionAs the pandemic unfolded in Switzerland, also health and social behavior changed between March  to May . Changes in adherence to mitigation measures differ between language regions and reflect the COVID- incidence patterns in the investigated mitigation periods, with higher adherence in regions with previously higher incidence. Targeted communcation of mitigation measures and policy making should include cultural, geographical and socioeconomic aspects to address yet unknown long-term population health consequences caused by the pandemic.","doc_id":15600,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9520","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Der diabetische Fuss : Vorsorge - was können Sie selber tun","authors":"Keller-Senn, Anita; Imhof, Lorenz","subject":" Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Buch","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Der diabetische Fuss : Vorsorge - was können Sie selber tun;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":15662,"prior":"diabetische","SDG3":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11143","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A nurse-delivered, clinic-based intervention to address intimate partner violence among low-income women in Mexico City : findings from a cluster randomized controlled trial","authors":"Gupta, Jhumka; Falb, Kathryn L.; Ponta, Oriana; Xuan, Ziming; Campos, Paola Abril; Gomez, Annabel Arellano; Valades, Jimena; Cariño, Gisele; Olavarrieta, Claudia Diaz","subject":"Health sector; Intimate partner violence; Violence against women; Quality of life;  Kultur;  Pflege","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"306, 610.73","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"A nurse-delivered, clinic-based intervention to address intimate partner violence among low-income women in Mexico City : findings from a cluster randomized controlled trial; Health sector; Intimate partner violence; Violence against women; Quality of life;  Kultur;  Pflege; Background: Rigorous evaluations of health sector interventions addressing intimate partner violence (IPV) in low- and middle-income countries are lacking. We aimed to assess whether an enhanced nurse-delivered intervention would reduce IPV and improve levels of safety planning behaviors, use of community resources, reproductive coercion, and mental quality of life.Methods: We randomized  public health clinics in Mexico City to treatment or control arms. In treatment clinics, women received the nurse-delivered session (IPV screening, supportive referrals, health/safety risk assessments) at baseline (T), and a booster counselling session after  months (T). In control clinics, women received screening and a referral card from nurses. Surveys were conducted at T, T, and T ( months from baseline). Our main outcome was past-year physical and sexual IPV. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted via three-level random intercepts models to evaluate the interaction term for treatment status by time.Results: Between April and October ,  women ( in control clinics,  in treatment clinics) with recent IPV experiences enrolled in the study. While reductions in IPV were observed for both women enrolled in treatment (OR, .; % CI, .-.; P < .) and control (OR, .; % CI, .-.; P < .) clinics at T (July to December ), no significant treatment effects were observed (OR, .; % CI, .-.; P = .). At T (July to December ), women in treatment clinics reported significant improvements, compared to women in control clinics, in mental quality of life (β, .; % CI, .-.; P = .) and safety planning behaviors (β, .; % CI, .-.; P = .).Conclusion: While reductions in IPV levels were seen among women in both treatment and control clinics, the enhanced nurse intervention was no more effective in reducing IPV. The enhanced nursing intervention may offer short-term improvements in addressing safety planning and mental quality of life. Nurses can play a supportive role in assisting women with IPV experiences.","doc_id":15683,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21838","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Personalized nutrition and social justice : ethical considerations within four future scenarios applying the perspective of Nussbaum’s capabilities approach","authors":"Nordström, Karin; Gossens, Joe","subject":"Personalised nutrition; Ethics; Social justice;  Diätetik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613.2","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Personalized nutrition and social justice : ethical considerations within four future scenarios applying the perspective of Nussbaum’s capabilities approach; Personalised nutrition; Ethics; Social justice;  Diätetik; The idea of personalized nutrition (PN) is to give tailored dietary advice based on personal health-related data, i.e. phenotoype, genotype, or lifestyle.

In this way, the non-humans (temporarily) stabilize the actor-network.","doc_id":15718,"prior":"Gesundheit","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7973","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"As a stone thrown in a still pond : predicting human influenza epidemiological dynamics after 2009 A/pH1N1 pandemic explosion","authors":"Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Schutten, Martin; Van der Vries, Erhard; Zhang, Jitao David; Boucher, Charles A; Anisimova, Maria; Gatti, Lorenzo","subject":"Phylodynamics; Epidemology; Influenza; Molecular sequence evolution;  Biochemie;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"572, 610","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"As a stone thrown in a still pond : predicting human influenza epidemiological dynamics after  A/pHN pandemic explosion; Phylodynamics; Epidemology; Influenza; Molecular sequence evolution;  Biochemie;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Seasonal influenza exhibits well-recognized epidemiological patterns.

The new Health Insurance Act mandates the introduction of a national tariff system which reflects differences in resource use across patients based on observable patient characteristics. In this study we develop a prospective payment system (PPS).Data: Primary data on patient characteristics, cost per episode and daily time spent by medical staff were collected in a survey of ’ patients from  inpatient psychiatric facilities in , representing roughly one third of the annual total. Patient characteristics include the main psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-) and a weekly assessment of the severity of illness using the Health of Nations Outcome Scales questionnaire (HoNOS).Methods: Predictors of per-diem cost are examined with a multivariate linear regression model. Explanatory variables include the main psychiatric diagnosis, HoNOS scores, socio-demographic characteristics, type of insurance plan, compulsory hospitalization, emergency hospitalization, and hospital fixed effects. Furthermore, a staggered progression of per-diem cost over time is modelled. Different variants of the tariff structure are evaluated, some of which include intentional deviation of the tariff from the true distribution of costs in order to set incentives. Goodness-of-fit is evaluated by an out-of-sample evaluation of several statistical measures of the deviation of hypothetical revenues and observed costs, such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).Results: Compared to the uniform per-diem tariff presently in operation in Switzerland, the PPS are capable of improving the accuracy of the tariff from a MAPE value of .% to approximately .%. The analysis yields several variants of PPS which are equivalent in terms of goodness-of-fit, but differ in terms of the patient characteristics used and with respect to financial incentives for hospitals. The main model constitutes a per-diem payment which is differentiated over three phases of treatment; the first week, days  to , and from the -st day onward. The payment is further determined by  diagnostic groups, scores in three out of the  dimensions of the HoNOS questionnaire (aggression, non-accidental self-injury, somatic comorbidity), and three age-related groups.Discussion: The proposed PPS combines incentives for an appropriate provision of care with incentives for a reduction of length of stay. Policy makers should take into account the different incentives implied by the alternative variants. While the PPS yields a set of adjusting factors for the payment, the Swiss system requires hospital-specific per-diem base rates to be negotiated between the mental health facilities and the insurers.","doc_id":15995,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"97","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2633","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Physical ergonomics at translators’ workplaces : findings from ergonomic workplace assessments and interviews","authors":"Meidert, Ursula; Neumann, Silke; Ehrensberger-Dow, Maureen; Becker, Heidrun Karin","subject":"Assessments; Translator; ErgoTrans; Ergonomics;  Translationswissenschaft;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"418.02, 620","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Physical ergonomics at translators’ workplaces : findings from ergonomic workplace assessments and interviews; Assessments; Translator; ErgoTrans; Ergonomics;  Translationswissenschaft;  Ingenieurwesen; Most professional translators in the Western world are heavy computer users and thus may be exposed to health risks known to be associated with computer work. These include musculoskeletal ailments of the upper extremities, back, shoulders, arms, hands and problems with the eyes. This paper reports on the findings of workplace assessments and interviews with professional translators with respect to the ergonomics of their workplaces and related health issues. A total of  professional translators working as freelancers, in institutional settings or in commercial enterprises were visited at their workplaces. Each workplace was assessed and compared to the recommendations about ergonomics available in the literature. In addition, interviews were held with translators immediately after the assessments about their current health status and any recent complaints. Many of the assessed workplaces evinced a high standard of ergonomically appropriate equipment and furniture. However, the equipment was in many cases not adjusted to suit the ergonomic needs of the individual using the workplace. Although the level of complaints was low overall, the highest number of health complaints related to the eyes, eck and shoulder girdle. Frequent breaks, changing position and doing short exercises to loosen up tense muscles would address these problems by helping to reduce tension and pain in the neck, shoulders and back and by providing rest for the eyes. Whenever possible, an ergonomic consultation is recommended. It is also recommended that ergonomic knowledge about proper workplace set-up should be provided in professional training.","doc_id":15999,"prior":"health risks","SDG3":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17387","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Voluntary pooling of genetic risk : a health insurance experiment","authors":"Mimra, Wanda; Nemitz, Janina; Waibel, Christian","subject":"Effort; Genetic risk; Health insurance; Pooling;  Soziale Probleme und Sozialversicherungen;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"360, 610","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Voluntary pooling of genetic risk : a health insurance experiment; Effort; Genetic risk; Health insurance; Pooling;  Soziale Probleme und Sozialversicherungen;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Scientific and technological advances increasingly allow for better tailoring of health insurance plans to individual health risk profiles. This development questions the sustainability of health plans that feature strong cross-subsidization across different health risk types and health behaviors. An important observation is that the willingness to cross-subsidize risks in health plans might depend on whether the risk is uncontrollable by individuals, such as genetic risk, or modifiable via health behaviors. This paper provides the results of an experiment on the willingness to pool genetic risk in health insurance. Subjects’ overall health risk has an assigned, uncontrollable genetic risk part that differs across individuals as well as a behavioral risk part, which can be reduced by costly effort. Participants can decide between a pooling, community-rated group insurance scheme and an insurance with a fully individually risk-adjusted premium. In the experimental variation, the group insurance scheme either includes behavioral risk or separates it out via individual premium discounts. Although we observe social preferences for pooling, only a low level of actual genetic risk pooling emerges across the experimental conditions. This is due to both large heterogeneity in social preferences across subjects, and the dynamics of the willingness to pay for group insurance in the different experimental markets.","doc_id":16036,"prior":"health risk","SDG3":1},{"id":"90","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19464","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Looking for a broad framework for the integration of mindfulness-based interventions in the educational system","authors":"Langer, Álvaro I; Steinebach, Christoph; García-Rubio, Carlos; Andreu, Catherine I; Torres-Díaz, Leandro","subject":" Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"371","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Looking for a broad framework for the integration of mindfulness-based interventions in the educational system;  Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten; Today, there is a crucial need for well-being to be a priority in the educational curriculum. st-century schools not only provide a broad set of academic skills, but they also promote the healthy development and mental health of children and adolescents through strengths-based education and the cultivation of socio-emotional and behavioral skills. Some of the evidence-based interventions that may address these requirements include mindfulness- and compassion-based programs (MBIs and CBIs). Nevertheless, there are still several open questions concerning the implementation of mindfulness in the educational system. In this chapter, our concern is how mindfulness may be integrated in a more comprehensive way in order to help ensure its sustainability in schools as well as in institutions embedded in specific socio-cultural contexts. Particularly, we suggest that a common, shared meaning in the educational system (i.e. individual and institutional level) may result in a network where mindfulness could be supported more sustainably. A shared meaning about why and for what ends adolescents should practice mindfulness may consider not solely a personal perspective but also a social and ecological one. In this context, MBIs would play a relevant role by mediating the multiple requirements introduced by a new mental health promotion paradigm in schools.","doc_id":16086,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1548","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Selbstregulation in der Arbeitswelt 4.0","authors":"Knafla, Imke; Keller, Carmen","subject":"Selbstregulation; Arbeitswelt 4.0; Psychische Gesundheit;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Arbeitsökonomie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"158, 331","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Selbstregulation in der Arbeitswelt .; Selbstregulation; Arbeitswelt .; Psychische Gesundheit;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Arbeitsökonomie; Die Arbeitswelt . ist von neuen Technologien, mobil-flexiblen Arbeitsplätzen, neuen Arbeitsprozessen und veränderten Anforderungen an die Menschen geprägt.

Results: On average, participants began their commercial sex work at . years old (range: –). Their main motives for sex work were coercion (.%) and the necessity to financially support families (.%). In total,  FSW (.%) wanted to quit commercial sex work. A mental disorder within the past  months was reported by  FSW (.%), with drug abuse clearly being the most prevalent diagnosis (.%). Sexual, physical, and emotional abuse were very common among the FSW, and substance use disorders (SUD) were significantly more prevalent in persons who experienced emotional abuse (OR = .). Prevalence rates of any mental disorder and SUD were higher in women who did sex work to support their family, whereas mood disorders were more frequent in those who needed the money to pay debts. Participants with any disorder were significantly older than those without (M age: . vs. . years) and had started significantly later in the sex business (M age: . vs. . years). Conclusion: Our study revealed that FSW in Chittagong are very vulnerable and highly impaired, as expressed by high rates of abuse and mental disorders. Coercion is very common and many FSW are required to work in the sex business because they need the money to support their families. FSW are a very marginalized population, especially in the developing countries where awareness for mental health is low and the availability of mental health services is insufficient.","doc_id":16137,"prior":"health policy","SDG3":1},{"id":"45","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12194","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Improving 2D and 3D skin in vitro models, using macromolecular crowding","authors":"Benny, Paula; Badowski, Cedric; Lane, E.

Inspired by the challenge of meeting the growing demand for this plant secondary metabolite, we developed a biotechnological platform based on cell suspension cultures of Satureja khuzistanica. The high amounts of RA produced by this system accumulated mainly inside the cells. To further improve production, two elicitors,  μM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and  mM cyclodextrin (CD), were tested, separately and together. MeJA increased RA productivity more than ‐fold, the elicited cultures achieving an RA production of . g L− without affecting biomass productivity. CD did not have a clear effect on RA production, and under the combined treatment of MeJA + CD only a small amount of RA was released to the medium. When the cell culture was transferred from a shake flask to a wave‐mixed bioreactor, a maximum RA production of . g L− and biomass productivity of . g L− d− was achieved under MeJA elicitation, demonstrating the suitability of S. khuzistanica cell suspensions for the biotechnological production of this bioactive plant secondary metabolite.","doc_id":16518,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"53","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/227","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Erwachsen werden mit Duchenne-Muskeldystrophie : Herausforderungen in der Transition vom Jugend- ins Erwachsenenalter","authors":"Jung, Anita; Marmet, Anja","subject":"duchenne muscular dystrophy; occupational therapy; transition; adulthood; adolescence; challenge;  Ergotherapie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.8515","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Erwachsen werden mit Duchenne-Muskeldystrophie : Herausforderungen in der Transition vom Jugend- ins Erwachsenenalter; duchenne muscular dystrophy; occupational therapy; transition; adulthood; adolescence; challenge;  Ergotherapie; Thema: Aufgrund medizinischer und therapeutischer Fortschritte ist die Lebenserwartung von jungen Männern mit Duchenne-Muskeldystrophie (DMD) stark angestiegen.

Ziel:  Mit der gezielten Gestaltung von Raucherzonen soll das Nichtrauchen als Norm etabliert und eine Vorbildfunktion für andere Bildungsinstitutionen wahrgenommen werden können. Dabei sollen die Raucherzonen so gestaltet werden, dass sie unter Berücksichtigung des Passivrauchschutzes, mit möglichst wenigen Kompromissen den Bedürfnissen der Zielgruppen gerecht werden. Methodik:  Das zentrale Forschungsinteresse liegt in der Bedürfnisabklärung der Mitarbeitenden sowie Studierenden des Departements Gesundheit, weshalb zwei Fokusgruppen durchgeführt und qualitativ ausgewertet wurden. Ergänzend dazu wurden sechs Expertengespräche geführt. Zentrale Ergebnisse:  Für alle Befragten ist es zentral, dass der Haupteingang rauchfrei bleibt.

Patients completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and the Need Evaluation Questionnaire, two standardized tools for symptoms and psychosocial needs assessment.

Automatically collected digital receipts from loyalty cards hereby promise to serve as an objective and automatically traceable digital marker for individual food choice behavior and do not require users to manually log individual meal items. With the introduction of the General Data Privacy Regulation in the European Union, millions of consumers gained the right to access their shopping data in a machine-readable form, representing a historic chance to leverage shopping data for scalable monitoring of food choices. Multiple quantitative indicators for evaluating the nutritional quality of food shopping have been suggested, but so far, no comparison has validated the potential of these alternative indicators within a comparative setting. This manuscript thus represents the first study to compare the calibration capacity and to validate the discrimination potential of previously suggested food shopping quality indicators for the nutritional quality of shopped groceries, including the Food Standards Agency Nutrient Profiling System Dietary Index (FSA-NPS DI), Grocery Purchase Quality Index- (GPQI), Healthy Eating Index- (HEI-), Healthy Trolley Index (HETI) and Healthy Purchase Index (HPI), checking if any of them performs differently from the others. The hypothesis is that some food shopping quality indicators outperform the others in calibrating and discriminating individual actual dietary intake. To assess the indicators’ potentials,  eligible participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and donated their digital receipts from the loyalty card programs of the two leading Swiss grocery retailers, which represent % of the national grocery market. Compared to absolute food and nutrient intake, correlations between density based relative food and nutrient intake and food shopping data are stronger. The FSA-NPS DI has the best calibration and discrimination performance in classifying participants’ consumption of nutrients and food groups, and seems to be a superior indicator to estimate nutritional quality of a user’s diet based on digital receipts from grocery shopping in Switzerland.","doc_id":17243,"prior":"diseases","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/877","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Synergetische Prozess-Outcome-Analyse der stationären Psychotherapie bei männlichen Patienten mit Alkoholabhängigkeit","authors":"Patzig, Judith","subject":"Synergie; Klinische Psychotherapie; Alkoholismus;  Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"150","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Synergetische Prozess-Outcome-Analyse der stationären Psychotherapie bei männlichen Patienten mit Alkoholabhängigkeit; Synergie; Klinische Psychotherapie; Alkoholismus;  Psychologie","doc_id":17248,"prior":"Alkoholismus","SDG3":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3358","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Elements of integrated care - post-discharge network coordination program (PDNC-P) : Zurich program for sustainable development of mental health services (ZInEP)","authors":"von Wyl, Agnes; Klauser, Mara; Passalacqua, Silvia; Heim, Gisela; Rössler, Wulf; Andreae, Andreas","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362, 616.89","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Elements of integrated care - post-discharge network coordination program (PDNC-P) : Zurich program for sustainable development of mental health services (ZInEP);  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","doc_id":17255,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15013","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Starting two antidepressants to prevent suicide : a potentially dangerous recommendation?","authors":"Hengartner, Michael Pascal; Plöderl, Martin","subject":" Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615, 616.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Starting two antidepressants to prevent suicide : a potentially dangerous recommendation?;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","doc_id":17281,"prior":"suicide","SDG3":1},{"id":"86","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9830","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Experimental shoulder testing under in-vivo anatomy and physiology","authors":"Kuster, Roman; Schmid, Bruno; Gossweiler, Lukas; Moor, Beat; Bouaicha, Samy; Baumgartner, Daniel","subject":"Experimental shoulder simulator; Joint reaction force; Humeral head migration; Cranial subluxation; Shoulder instability; Cadaveric humeri;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"610","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Experimental shoulder testing under in-vivo anatomy and physiology; Experimental shoulder simulator; Joint reaction force; Humeral head migration; Cranial subluxation; Shoulder instability; Cadaveric humeri;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Simulating arm abduction using a n experimental shoulder simulator which matches physiological conditions would be of highest interest in shoulder bio-mechanics, e.g. to study the influence of shoulder anomalies on joint reaction force and muscular activity levels, to simulate rotator cuff tears to analyse different surgical treatment approaches, or to investigate primary stability of newly developed implants.

In particular since in vitro models of reconstructed human epidermis are increasingly used as models for diseased skin. In general, diffusion cell experiments are perfomred to determine the diffusion flux of thest substances through either skin models or excised skin either from humans or animals. Local concentration of the test substances within the skin are then calculated applying diffusion laws and suited boundary conditions.In this study we were using a direct approach to reveal the loacl concentrations of test substances within skin using confocal Raman microscopy. This non-invasive method can also be applied in vivo and therefore we were directly comparing in vivo concentrations with those obtained from commercially available reconstructed human epidermis (RHE). Hydrophilic and lipophilic test substances with log Pow from -. to . were topically applied on human skin in vivo and RHE from SkinEthic was used as the commercial skin model. Local concentration profiles in the stratum corneum (SC) showed substantial differences between the RHE model and the in vivo situation. Differences between RHE models and human skin in vivo were also observed in their molecular composition, in particular in terms of their water profile, lipid content and the presence of natural moisturizing factor (NMF). Confocal Raman is shown to be a powerful non-invasive method for qualitative and quantitative comparative studies between RHE models and human skin in vivo. This method can alos be applied to validate RHE models for future use in clinical studies.","doc_id":17424,"prior":"diseased","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3367","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Can we forster a culture of peer support and promote mental health in adolescence using a web-based app?

A control group study; Mental health; Health promotion; Mobile application; Adolescence; Peer group; Mentor;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Soziale Gruppen;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie; Background: Adolescence with its many transitions is a vulnerable period for the development of mental illnesses. Establishing effective mental health promotion programs for this age group is a challenge crucial to societal health. Programs must account for the specific developmental tasks that adolescents face. Considering peer influence and fostering adolescent autonomy strivings is essential. Participation in a program should be compelling to young people, and their affinity to new technologies offers unprecedented opportunities in this respect.Objective: The Companion App was developed as a Web-based app giving adolescents access to a peer mentoring system and interactive, health-relevant content to foster a positive peer culture among adolescents and thereby strengthen social support and reduce stress.Methods: In a control group study design, a group of employed (n=) and unemployed (n=) adolescents had access to the Companion App during a -month period. The intervention was evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze changes in chronic stress levels and perception of social support. Monthly feedback on the app and qualitative interviews at the end of the study allowed for an in-depth exploration of the adolescents’ perception of the intervention.Results: Adolescents in the intervention group did not use the Companion App consistently. The intervention had no significant effect on chronic stress levels or the perception of social support. Adolescents reported endorsing the concept of the app and the implementation of a peer mentoring system in particular. However, technical difficulties and insufficiently obvious benefits of using the app impeded more frequent usage.Conclusions: The Companion Project implemented a theory-driven and innovative approach to mental health promotion in adolescence, taking into account the specifics of this developmental phase.

As a first step in mitigating the related health risks, one has to delineate zones where metal concentrations exceed tolerable levels. Predictions of metal concentrations are usually required for blocks because remediation or regulatory decisions are imposed for entire parcels. Parcel areas typically exceed the observation support, but are smaller than the survey domain. Mapping soil pollution involves therefore a local change of support. Using data from an extensive survey of heavy metals in the soils around a metal smelter, we validate in this study geostatistical block predictions with measured heavy metal concentrations that were representative for the mean metal content on  parcels with areas of - m. Block predictions were computed by conditional simulations (CS) and several variants of lognormal universal (LUK), constrained (LCK) and covariance-matching constrained (LCMCK) block kriging from observations with quasi-point support (- m). Lognormal block kriging predictions were either computed based on the assumption that both observations and block means are lognormally distributed or by averaging lognormal point kriging predictions. Target quantities were the block means of metal content in - cm depth and exceedance of regulatory thresholds by these means. CS gave the most precise predictions, both of block means and of threshold exceedance. However, the advantage was not pronounced: LUK, although slightly negatively biased, predicted block means nearly as well and was not much worse than LCK, LCMCK or CS when predicting threshold exceedance. LCK was partly positively biased (in particular when averaging lognormal constrained point kriging predictions) and was clearly less precise than LUK and CS when predicting block means. All four methods predicted threshold exceedance with good success as judged by the areas under Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (.-.). The good performance of LUK was rather surprising because nonlinear transforms of customary block kriging predictions are commonly known to be biased because kriging predictions are smoother than the target quantities. The relative success of LUK must be attributed to dense soil sampling around the validation parcels that dominantly lay in the severely contaminated part of the survey domain where a lot of soil samples had been taken. When sampling is dense the smoothing bias of block kriging does not matter much. In this situation, we can expect only limited gains in the precision of predictions by more sophisticated methods such as CS and LCK.","doc_id":17664,"prior":"health risks","SDG3":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21283","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Promoting children : recommendations for dealing with AD(H)D in the decision-making process","authors":"Wieber, Frank; Robin, Dominik; Neumann, Sascha; Schöbi, Dominik; Rüttimann, Dieter; Wimberger, Karin; Walitza, Susanne; von Rhein, Michael; Hotz, Sandra","subject":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Round-table meetings; Mental disorder; Child and adolescent health; Decision-making; Treatment decision;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Pädiatrie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"615, 618.92","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Promoting children : recommendations for dealing with AD(H)D in the decision-making process; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Round-table meetings; Mental disorder; Child and adolescent health; Decision-making; Treatment decision;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Pädiatrie; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common mental disorder in childhood worldwide. In Switzerland, regional studies indicated an increase in pharmacological treatment, which has led to concerns among politicians, scientists and affected families. This research project investigated how parents choose the treatment for their children, how pediatricians diagnose and treat ADHD, how teachers deal with ADHD, how the different actors cooperate and, most importantly, how affected children can be placed in the center of the efforts. The project used a mixed-method approach. Participants in Switzerland were recruited with the help of professional associations. Parents and teachers/health educators filled in an online survey (n= and n=, respectively) and were interviewed (n= and n=, respectively). Pediatricians filled in an online survey (n=). The analysis of the parent survey showed that the path to a treatment decision is characterized by lengthy treatment histories. As most important reason for pharmacological treatment, parents reported the suffering, which manifested itself in a variety of problems that started in the school environment but then spilled over to the family system. As central finding from the responses of teachers/health educators and pediatricians, actors from the child's environment (i.e., teachers, physicians, and parents) should cooperate in \"round table\" meetings that serve to informing the actors and to destigmatizing and involving the child. To promote the well-being of the child, ADHD must be understood, diagnosed and treated as a multifactorial phenomenon. In addition to knowledge, communication and cooperation between the actors are important. The data also suggest a paradigm shift, whereby the conventional \"bio-medical\" model has already been replaced by an alternative \"social construction\" model that takes children's environment into account.","doc_id":17722,"prior":"mental disorder","SDG3":1},{"id":"67","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9515","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Ambulantes pflegegeleitetes Beratungsprogramm für Patienten mit einer diabetischen Fussulzeration","authors":"Keller-Senn, Anita; Probst, S.; Imhof, Lorenz","subject":" Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Ambulantes pflegegeleitetes Beratungsprogramm für Patienten mit einer diabetischen Fussulzeration;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":17763,"prior":"diabetischen","SDG3":1},{"id":"23","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18986","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Correlating twitter language with community-level health outcomes","authors":"Schneuwly, Arno; Grubenmann, Ralf; Logean, Séverine Rion; Cieliebak, Mark; Jaggi, Martin","subject":" Spezielle Computerverfahren;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"006, 610","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Correlating twitter language with community-level health outcomes;  Spezielle Computerverfahren;  Medizin und Gesundheit; We study how language on social media is linked to diseases such as atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD), diabetes and various types of cancer.

More specifically, the training intervention aims to test whether developing the emotional intelligence of students enrolled on an MA Translation programme could lead to improved emotional functioning, long-term personality changes, and positive implications for important life outcomes, such as psychological well-being and graduate employability. The authors will situate their research within the literature on emotional intelligence and illustrate the relevance of emotional competencies for translator training.","doc_id":17944,"prior":"psychological well-being","SDG3":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15010","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Gene expression signatures of pathways alterations in tumor cells caused by plant extracts","authors":"Wagschal, Isabelle; Eggenschwiler, Jenny; von Balthazar, Leopold; Patrignani, Andrea; Rehrauer, Hubert; Schlapbach, Ralph; Ramos, Mac H.; Viviani, Angelika","subject":" Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"616","year":"2007","for_data_analysis":"Gene expression signatures of pathways alterations in tumor cells caused by plant extracts;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Extracts of Viscum album from different host trees (Iscador®Qu, M, P and A) and isolated mistletoe lectin showed distinct gene-expression profiles using cDNA microarrays.

Reactions between ,‐dibromopyridine and primary or secondary, cyclic or acyclic, and aliphatic or aromatic amines were shown to selectively yield the respective ‐bromopyridine‐‐amines in very high yields which were successfully used as substrates for subsequent C-C cross‐coupling reactions. The recently introduced dichloro‐bis[‐(dicyclohexylphosphanyl)piperidine]palladium was used as catalyst for the cross‐coupling of ‐bromopyridine‐‐amines with arylboronic acids, diaryl‐ and dialkylzinc reagents or olefins and hence, is also an excellent C-C cross‐coupling catalyst for this type of substrate. Moreover, all the reaction protocols presented were in each of the catalyses uniformly applied.

A special focus in the clinical field is placed on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), especially on those isolated from the stromal vascular fraction of the adipose tissue. Due to their good clinical efficacy and tolerability, they can be used for allogeneic cell therapies (e.g. Crohn’s disease, graft versus host disease, acute myocardial infarct). However, the required number of therapeutically active human adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (hASCs) for allogeneic applications is in the range of trillion cells per year. Thus, alternatives to the -dimensional planar cultivation systems, typically applied to propagate hASCs are urgently required. Different studies have recently demonstrated the applicability of stirred single-use bioreactors as a promising alternative to the planar cultivation systems. In these dynamically mixed culture systems, the required growth surface for the adherent growing cells is provided by microcarriers (MCs), which are suspended in the bioreactor. Although adherent mammalian cells are well investigated in combination with MCs for the production of vaccines, working with hASCs is more complex due to their higher shear sensitivity. This raises the question of how the induced fluid shear stress affects the cell expansion, the cell quality and the formation of MC-cell agglomerates during the cultivation in dynamic bioreactors. For this purpose, MC-based cell expansions were performed in single-use spinner flasks at different impeller speeds below (,  rpm) and above ( and  rpm) the specific suspension criteria NSu ( rpm) and NS ( rpm) for polystyrene-based MCs.

The results indicated that too low ( rpm) and too high impeller speeds ( rpm) result in statistically significant lower cell densities (. and . x  cells/mL) compared to those at the suspension criteria (. and . x  cells/mL). These lower cell densities can be ascribed to mass transport limitations at low impeller speeds and to too high hydrodynamic strains at high impeller speeds. The effect of the shear stress on the MC-cell agglomerate formation at high impeller speeds was not significant, when compared the Sauter mean diameters to those resulting at the suspension criteria. In contrast, impeller speeds below the suspension criteria resulted in a strong MC-agglomerate formation, which may support mass transfer limitations.","doc_id":18126,"prior":"disease","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"49","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22071","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Impact of shear stress on cell growth and microcarrier-cell-agglomerate formation in microcarrier-based cultivations of adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells","authors":"Jossen, Valentin; Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Kraume, Matthias; Pörtner, Ralf; Eibl, Dieter","subject":" Biomedizin, Biomedizinische Technik;  Technische Chemie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"610.28, 660","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Impact of shear stress on cell growth and microcarrier-cell-agglomerate formation in microcarrier-based cultivations of adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells;  Biomedizin, Biomedizinische Technik;  Technische Chemie; Cell-based therapies have become increasingly important in the field of regenerative medicine, as global revenues of approximately  billion US$ indicate.

A special focus in the clinical field is placed on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), especially on those isolated from the stromal vascular fraction of the adipose tissue. Due to their good clinical efficacy and tolerability, they can be used for allogeneic cell therapies (e.g. Crohn’s disease, graft versus host disease, acute myocardial infarct). However, the required number of therapeutically active human adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (hASCs) for allogeneic applications is in the range of trillion cells per year. Thus, alternatives to the -dimensional planar cultivation systems, typically applied to propagate hASCs are urgently required. Different studies have recently demonstrated the applicability of stirred single-use bioreactors as a promising alternative to the planar cultivation systems. In these dynamically mixed culture systems, the required growth surface for the adherent growing cells is provided by microcarriers (MCs), which are suspended in the bioreactor. Although adherent mammalian cells are well investigated in combination with MCs for the production of vaccines, working with hASCs is more complex due to their higher shear sensitivity. This raises the question of how the induced fluid shear stress affects the cell expansion, the cell quality and the formation of MC-cell agglomerates during the cultivation in dynamic bioreactors. For this purpose, MC-based cell expansions were performed in single-use spinner flasks at different impeller speeds below (,  rpm) and above ( and  rpm) the specific suspension criteria NSu ( rpm) and NS ( rpm) for polystyrene-based MCs. Cell numbers, metabolites and the formation of MC-cell agglomerates were measured during the cell expansion process. Furthermore, the expression of standard surface markers (CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD) for hASCs were analysed after harvesting of the cells. Beside the biological investigations, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations were performed in order to predict the velocity gradients and the hydrodynamic forces. The results indicated that too low ( rpm) and too high impeller speeds ( rpm) result in statistically significant lower cell densities (. and . x  cells/mL) compared to those at the suspension criteria (. and . x  cells/mL).

The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of carers who care for a loved one with a fungating breast wound.Method: To explore the lived experiences of carers, a methodological framework using Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenology and semi-structured interviews was used. Seven carers were interviewed from January until November .Results: Having to deal with a situation of a loved one with a visible cancer was hard for all the carers. The visibility of the cancer was one of the most shocking aspects to deal with from the perspective of the patient and the carer. The presence of the visible wound and a cancer at an advanced stage contributed to a change in the relationship and extreme suffering for both the patient and the carer. Despite many problems such as wound odour and copious discharge from the wound, which was difficult to control, carers did their best to help their loved one with the wound. Gradually, the wound became the centre of the patient and carer’s life, and a great deal of time was spent trying to control the wound symptoms. All carers managed the wound on their own without help and advice from health care practitioners. For all of them, it was a major burden and they felt isolated.Conclusion: This study contributes to an understanding that the care of women and their carers needs strategies that are integrated in palliative wound care that takes a holistic and empathic approach that responds to patients’ and carers’ psychosocial and emotional needs and a practical need for information to help carers assist in managing the wound-related symptoms.","doc_id":18315,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9772","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Perceived discrimination against diabetics in the workplace and in work-related insurances in Switzerland","authors":"Nebiker-Pedrotti, Piera M; Keller, Ulrich; Iselin, Hans-Ulrich; Ruiz, Juan; Pärli, Kurt; Caplazi, Alexandra; Puder, Jardena J","subject":"Risk factor; Diabetes Mellitus;  Arbeitsökonomie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"331","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Perceived discrimination against diabetics in the workplace and in work-related insurances in Switzerland; Risk factor; Diabetes Mellitus;  Arbeitsökonomie; Background: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of perceived diabetes-related discrimination in the workplace and in work-related insurances in persons with diabetes mellitus in Switzerland.Methods:  insulin-treated diabetic subjects representative of the northwestern Swiss population responded to a self-report questionnaire on perceived diabetes-related discrimination in the workplace and in work-related insurances (salary loss insurance, supplementary occupational plan).

For them, well-being and future life prospects are often worrisome. Children growing up in these families are particularly affected by multiple stressors in the family system correlated to psychosocial and socio-economic problems of the parents. Scientific studies show that, due to the multiplicity and complexity of interrelated factors, these children are significantly more likely to experience developmental risks, emotional problems and behavioural problems. Children and young people from families with multiple and complex problems are therefore one of the primary target groups in child protection. For professionals, it is generally very challenging to make predictive assessments and far-reaching decisions in child protection. This is especially true in support services for families with multiple and complex problems, because the problems are so numerous and intertwined. Outcomes may differ for each of the family members and solving one problem may interfere with and/or reinforce another set of problems. This complicates the assessments of the family situation, participatory decision-making and lasting solutions. Because of the heterogeneity of families addressed under this target-group label, a certain degree of flexibility is required in providing care. The question to what extent standardized decision-making procedures provide sufficient freedom to make the best use of professional expertise and personal experience of families and family members therefore needs to be addressed. Lessons learned from consequential failures in child protection (e.g. severe forms of child abuse and or death of children despite the involvement of care workers) show that causes are often various and originate from multiple levels. They should not only take into account the action of families and care workers, but also related organizational and systemic factors.","doc_id":18702,"prior":"child abuse","SDG3":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23798","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Image-based assessment of extracellular mucin-to-tumor area predicts consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) in colorectal cancer","authors":"Nguyen, Huu-Giao; Lundström, Oxana; Blank, Annika; Dawson, Heather; Lugli, Alessandro; Anisimova, Maria; Zlobec, Inti","subject":" Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Image-based assessment of extracellular mucin-to-tumor area predicts consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) in colorectal cancer;  Biochemie; The backbone of all colorectal cancer classifications including the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) highlights microsatellite instability (MSI) as a key molecular pathway.

Here, we investigate the association of CMS classification and mucin-to-tumor area quantified using a deep learning algorithm, and  the expression of specific mucins in predicting CMS groups and clinical outcome. A weakly supervised segmentation method was developed to quantify extracellular mucin-to-tumor area in H&E images. Performance was compared to two pathologists' scores, then applied to two cohorts: () TCGA (n =  slides/ patients) used for mucin-CMS group correlation and () Bern (n =  slides/ patients) for histopathological correlations and next-generation Tissue Microarray construction. TCGA and CPTAC (n =  patients) were used to further validate mucin detection and CMS classification by gene and protein expression analysis for MUC, MUC, MUCAC and MUCB. An excellent inter-observer agreement between pathologists' scores and the algorithm was obtained (ICC = .). In TCGA, mucinous tumors were predominantly CMS (.%), CMS (.%) and CMS (.%). Average mucin in CMS was .%, indicating negligible amounts. RNA and protein expression of MUC, MUC, MUCAC and MUCB were low-to-absent in CMS. MUCAC protein expression correlated with aggressive tumor features (e.g., distant metastases (p = .), BRAF mutation (p < .), mismatch repair-deficiency (p < .), and unfavorable -year overall survival (% versus % for positive/negative staining). MUC expression showed the opposite trend, correlating with less lymphatic (p = .) and venous vessel invasion (p = .), no impact on survival.The absence of mucin-expressing tumors in CMS provides an important phenotype-genotype correlation. Together with MSI, mucinous histology may help predict CMS classification using only histopathology and should be considered in future image classifiers of molecular subtypes.","doc_id":18712,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21645","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"The role of 5G for digital healthcare against COVID-19 pandemic : opportunities and challenges","authors":"Siriwardhana, Yushan; Gür, Gürkan; Ylianttila, Mika; Liyanage, Madhusanka","subject":"COVID-19; Pandemic; 5G; IoT; E-health;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Elektro-, Kommunikations-, Steuerungs- und Regelungstechnik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362, 621.3","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"The role of G for digital healthcare against COVID- pandemic : opportunities and challenges; COVID-; Pandemic; G; IoT; E-health;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Elektro-, Kommunikations-, Steuerungs- und Regelungstechnik; COVID- pandemic caused a massive impact on healthcare, social life, and economies on a global scale.

The new Health Insurance Act mandates the introduction of a national tariff system which reflects differences in resource use across patients based on observable patient characteristics. In this study we develop a prospective payment system (PPS).Data: Primary data on patient characteristics, cost per episode and daily time spent by medical staff were collected in a survey of ’ patients from  inpatient psychiatric facilities in , representing roughly one third of the annual total. Patient characteristics include the main psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-) and a weekly assessment of the severity of illness using the Health of Nations Outcome Scales questionnaire (HoNOS).Methods: Predictors of per-diem cost are examined with a multivariate linear regression model. Explanatory variables include the main psychiatric diagnosis, HoNOS scores, socio-demographic characteristics, type of insurance plan, compulsory hospitalization, emergency hospitalization, and hospital fixed effects. Furthermore, a staggered progression of per-diem cost over time is modelled. Different variants of the tariff structure are evaluated, some of which include intentional deviation of the tariff from the true distribution of costs in order to set incentives. Goodness-of-fit is evaluated by an out-of-sample evaluation of several statistical measures of the deviation of hypothetical revenues and observed costs, such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).Results: Compared to the uniform per-diem tariff presently in operation in Switzerland, the PPS are capable of improving the accuracy of the tariff from a MAPE value of .% to approximately .%. The analysis yields several variants of PPS which are equivalent in terms of goodness-of-fit, but differ in terms of the patient characteristics used and with respect to financial incentives for hospitals. The main model constitutes a per-diem payment which is differentiated over three phases of treatment; the first week, days  to , and from the -st day onward. The payment is further determined by  diagnostic groups, scores in three out of the  dimensions of the HoNOS questionnaire (aggression, non-accidental self-injury, somatic comorbidity), and three age-related groups.Discussion: The proposed PPS combines incentives for an appropriate provision of care with incentives for a reduction of length of stay. Policy makers should take into account the different incentives implied by the alternative variants. While the PPS yields a set of adjusting factors for the payment, the Swiss system requires hospital-specific per-diem base rates to be negotiated between the mental health facilities and the insurers.","doc_id":18829,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20837","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Therapeutic success in relapse prevention in alcohol use disorder : the role of treatment motivation and drinking-related treatment goals","authors":"Senn, Smeralda; Odenwald, Michael; Sehrig, Sarah; Haffke, Peter; Rockstroh, Brigitte; Pereyra Kröll, Devi; Menning, Hans; Wieber, Frank; Volken, Thomas; Rösner, Susanne","subject":"Alcohol use disorder; Treatment motivation; Drinking goal; Transtheoretical model of behavior change;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"158, 616.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Therapeutic success in relapse prevention in alcohol use disorder : the role of treatment motivation and drinking-related treatment goals; Alcohol use disorder; Treatment motivation; Drinking goal; Transtheoretical model of behavior change;  Angewandte Psychologie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Journal of Addictive Diseases on .

The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change provides a theoretical framework for explaining and predicting behavioral change, although its predictive value for addiction is somewhat inconsistent.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study is to extend the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change by investigating not only treatment motivation but also the predictive value of the type of drinking-related treatment goal. Additional predictors, such as substance-related and sociodemographic variables, are also included in analyses seeking to predict return to drinking during relapse prevention treatment for alcohol use disorder.MethodsIn this observational study,  inpatients from a treatment center for alcohol use disorder were recruited. Treatment motivation was assessed in accordance with the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, drinking-related treatment goal through a self-report questionnaire, and substance-related and sociodemographic variables via the clinic information system. Associations between the potential predictors and covariates were explored using stepwise logistic regression.ResultsDuring treatment, .% of participants had at least one relapse. Scoring higher on the action dimension at admission (OR = ., p = .) and being employed (OR = ., p = .) were significant predictors of abstinence during treatment.ConclusionsThis study confirms that treatment motivation contributes to the prediction of treatment outcome, even when controlling for other variables.

If total PSA alone is used to determine the need for prostate biopsy, the disadvantages of this lower threshold probably outweigh its potential benefits.","doc_id":18896,"prior":"cancers","SDG3":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6990","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Genome-based population structure analysis of the strawberry plant pathogen Xanthomonas fragariae reveals two distinct groups that evolved independently before its species description","authors":"Gétaz, Michael; Krijger, Marjon; Rezzonico, Fabio; Smits, Theo; van der Wolf, Jan M.; Pothier, Joël F.","subject":" Biochemie;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 634","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Genome-based population structure analysis of the strawberry plant pathogen Xanthomonas fragariae reveals two distinct groups that evolved independently before its species description;  Biochemie;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft; Xanthomonas fragariae is a quarantine organism in Europe, causing angular leaf spots on strawberry plants. It is spreading worldwide in strawberry-producing regions due to import of plant material through trade and human activities. In order to resolve the population structure at the strain level, we have employed high-resolution molecular typing tools on a comprehensive strain collection representing global and temporal distribution of the pathogen. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat regions (CRISPRs) and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) were identified within the reference genome of X. fragariae LMG  as a potential source of variation. Strains from our collection were whole-genome sequenced and used in order to identify variable spacers and repeats for discriminative purpose. CRISPR spacer analysis and multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) displayed a congruent population structure, in which two major groups and a total of four subgroups were revealed. The two main groups were genetically separated before the first X. fragariae isolate was described and are potentially responsible for the worldwide expansion of the bacterial disease. Three primer sets were designed for discriminating CRISPR-associated markers in order to streamline group determination of novel isolates. Overall, this study describes typing methods to discriminate strains and monitor the pathogen population structure, more especially in the view of a new outbreak of the pathogen.","doc_id":18910,"prior":"disease","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/25079","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Evaluation of knowledge about gestational diabetes mellitus among postpartum women and its connection with women's sociodemographic and clinical characteristics : a quantitative cross-sectional study","authors":"Gomez Gonzalez de Langarica, Aroa; Hediger, Hannele; Meier Kaeppeli, Barbara; Keller-Senn, Anita","subject":"Gestational diabetes; Knowledge; Educational level; Cross-sectional study;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Evaluation of knowledge about gestational diabetes mellitus among postpartum women and its connection with women's sociodemographic and clinical characteristics : a quantitative cross-sectional study; Gestational diabetes; Knowledge; Educational level; Cross-sectional study;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Objective: to define the knowledge level among postpartum women affected by gestational diabetes and identify its association with women’s sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Design and Setting: a cross-sectional comparative study was conducted. Data collection took place in a single university hospital in the German speaking part of Switzerland. Participants: a total of  postpartum women diagnosed with gestational diabetes in the current preg- nancy completed a gestational diabetes mellitus specific knowledge questionnaire (GDMKQ) in German or English in their postpartum period. Further, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected.

Falls in the elderly are an important public health issue, given the often severe medical consequences and persistent mobility impairments, together with the demographic development. Falls are often due to a combination of internal and external, e.g. environmental, risk factors. The Swiss League Against Rheumatism (SLAR) developed a multidimensional home-based fall prevention programme (FPP), where a trained physiotherapist (PT) or occupational therapist (OT) provides a  to -minutes visit to the senior at her/his home. The therapist performs a detailed assessment of the senior’s individual risk of falling and subsequently recommends eliminating the identified environmental risk factors and provides tailored exercises. Four weeks later, the PT/OT calls the senior to check if a follow-up visit is required. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the FPP over one year. Primary outcome was the rate of falls; secondary outcomes were fear of falling, as well as PTs’ recommendations and seniors’ satisfaction and adherence. Methods. A prospective observational study was carried out. Participants’ demographic characteristics and fall risk were assessed at baseline, using the ‘Timed Up&Go’ (TUG) with additional motor (TUGmot) and cognitive tasks (TUGcog). Data on falls were assessed at baseline and during one year by fall diaries and bi-monthly telephone calls. The post-intervention fall-rate was compared with the pre-intervention fall-rate; fear of falling was assessed at the same time points using the Fall Efficacy Scale (FESI,  items on a - point scale). A PoissonGEE model for fall counts and a Linear Mixed model for Fall Efficacy Scale were fitted to the data. Additionally the main PTs’ recommendations and seniors’ satisfaction with the intervention and adherence to the exercises after one year were assessed.  Results. The analysis was carried out over . person-years. The participants were mainly female (%), with a mean age of . years (SD=., range - years); % and % of the participants were able to perform the TUG and the TUGmot respectively, compared to % able to perform the TUGcog. The fall rate decreased from . falls (corresponding to  falls) before the intervention to . falls (corresponding to . falls) after the intervention, i.e. a relative rate reduction (RRR) of -. (% CI: -., .). Fear of falling decreased after one year by FESI -. points (% CI: -, -.).  Main recommendations made by PTs/OTs was “fixing down carpets” (%) and ‘instruction of up to  exercises’ (strength, balance, multi-task capability) (.%). Almost all seniors (.%) were satisfied with the programme, a follow-up visit was provided to % of the seniors. After one year, % of the participants reported to exercise ‘always’, ‘most of time’ or ‘sometimes’.   Conclusions.This low-threshold, multidimensional home-based FPP achieved a % fall rate reduction, indicating a potential causal effect of the FPP. The FPP was feasible, and a substantial number of participants was adherent after one year.  Implications. Provided that the planned cost-effectiveness study is positive, the FPP developed by the SLAR and provided by PTs and OTs should be established in the national health system and reimbursed to participants.

Informal caregivers provide the main support for older people with cancer treated in this setting. Snyder () developed a model depicting informal caregiver impact when supporting/caring for someone with cancer. The model identifies four domains impacted by undertaking the role of informal caregiver: emotional; spiritual; social/role; and physical. This model was used to frame this systematic review. The authors first sought to appraise and synthesise contemporary literature related to the experience of informal caregivers of people with cancer with particular emphasis on caregivers of older people with cancer. Second, the saliency of Snyder’s model in light of the current literature was determined. Materials and Methods: The electronic data bases Medline and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition were searched and  research articles reporting on quantitative, qualitative or mixed-method studies identified that fitted the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The research reports were appraised using standardised forms and their results systematically extracted for a narrative synthesis. Results: The findings are congruent with those of Snyder (), indicating that informal caregivers experience deep impacts within the emotional, social/role, physical and spiritual domains. Possible new impacts emerged from the literature reviewed: caregivers are reported, for example, to perceive an increased sense of altruism or to deny and suppress their own feelings. Other impacts reported were role overload and a sense of role captivity. Additionally, results of the current review suggest some overlap between impact domains described by Snyder’s model. The review highlighted also the paucity of evidence in relation to caregiver impact in the physical and spiritual domain, as well as pertaining to the assessment of caregiver needs in general and of caregivers of older cancer patients in particular. Conclusion: To be able to provide necessary support to informal caregivers of older cancer patients, nurses need to be knowledgeable about the experiences and needs of these caregivers. Further studies investigating specific impacts and needs of caregivers of older people with cancer are needed. Moreover, the results of the review warrant development and testing of the subjective caregiver impact model in future studies.","doc_id":19110,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3458","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Maternal mental health in the first three weeks postpartum : the impact of caregiver support and the subjective experience of childbirth – a longitudinal path model","authors":"Gürber, Susanne; Bielinski-Blattmann, Daniela; Lemola, Sakari; Jaussi, Chantal; von Wyl, Agnes; Surbek, Daniel; Grob, Alexander; Stadlmayr, Werner","subject":"Acute stress reaction; Postpartum depressive symptom; Subjective birth; Experience; Caregiver support; Path model;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Maternal mental health in the first three weeks postpartum : the impact of caregiver support and the subjective experience of childbirth – a longitudinal path model; Acute stress reaction; Postpartum depressive symptom; Subjective birth; Experience; Caregiver support; Path model;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Objective: Acute stress reactions (ASR) and postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) are frequent after childbirth.

The latter group exploits abandoned and degraded urban niches which, in the case of plants, forms what is called the Third Landscape. In the Anthropocene, cities, open spaces and buildings must be planned and designed considering not only human needs but also those of other living organisms. The scientific approach of habitat sharing is defined as Reconciliation Ecology, whilst the action of implementing the ecosystem services and functioning of such anthropogenic habitats is called Urban Rehabilitation. However, urban development still represents the main cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Yet, the approach of planners and landscape architects highly diverges from that of ecologists and scientists on how to perceive, define and design urban green and blue infrastructure. For instance, designers focus on the positive impact that Nature (generally associated with indoor and outdoor greeneries) has on human well-being, often neglecting ecosystems’ health. Instead, considering the negative impact of any form of development and to achieve the No Net Loss Aichi’s objectives, conservationists apply mitigation hierarchy policies to avoid or reduce the impact and to offset biodiversity. The rationale of this review paper is to set the fundamentals for a multidisciplinary design framework tackling the issue of biodiversity loss in the urban environment by design for Nature. The method focuses on the building/city/landscape scales and is enabled by emerging digital technologies, i.e. Geographic Information Systems, Building Information Modelling, ecological simulation and computational design.","doc_id":19124,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23173","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Kinderherz, Elternschmerz? : wie Eltern, deren Kind an einem angeborenen Herzfehler leidet, die postoperative Phase im akutstationären Setting erleben","authors":"Ochsner, Jeanne Laura; Petruzzi, Rowena Giulia","subject":"Congenital heart defect; Child; Parents; Experience; Stationary; Cardiac surgery;  Familiensoziologie;  Pflege","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"306.8, 610.73","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Kinderherz, Elternschmerz? : wie Eltern, deren Kind an einem angeborenen Herzfehler leidet, die postoperative Phase im akutstationären Setting erleben; Congenital heart defect; Child; Parents; Experience; Stationary; Cardiac surgery;  Familiensoziologie;  Pflege; Darstellung des Themas: Jährlich kommen in der Schweiz  bis  Kinder mit einem angeborenen Herzfehler zur Welt, wovon etwa  eine Operation benötigen.

Micronutrient deficiencies, a less visible form of undernutrition, are also endemic. They may lead to increased morbidity and mortality as well as to impaired cognitive and physical development.Objective: To estimate the lifetime costs of micronutrient deficiencies in Pakistani children aged between  and  months.Methods: We develop a health economic model of the lifetime health and cost consequences of iodine, iron, vitamin A, and zinc deficiencies. We assess medical costs, production losses in terms of future incomes lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). The estimation is based on large population surveys, information on the health consequences of micronutrient deficiencies extracted from randomized trials, and a variety of other sources.Results: Total societal costs amount to US$ million in medical costs, US$, million in production losses, and . million DALYs. Costs are dominated by the impaired cognitive development induced by iron-deficiency anemia in - to -month-old children and the mortality caused by vitamin a deficiency. Costs are substantially higher in poorer households.Conclusions: Societal costs amounted to .% of gross domestic product and .% of DALYs in Pakistan in . These costs hinder the country’s development.

Policies, suitable service provision, and training are needed to identify and treat psychological morbidity following a traumatic birth experience, but currently there is little insight into whether and what is provided in different contexts. The aim of this knowledge mapping exercise was to map policy, service and training provision for women following a traumatic birth experience in different European countries.Methods: A survey was distributed as part of the COST Action “Perinatal mental health and birth-related trauma: Maximizing best practice and optimal outcomes”. Questions were designed to capture country level data; care provision (i.e., national policies or guidelines for the screening, treatment and/or prevention of a traumatic birth, service provision), and nationally mandated pre-registration and post-registration training for maternity professionals.Results: Eighteen countries participated. Only one country (the Netherlands) had national policies regarding the screening, treatment, and prevention of a traumatic birth experience/CB-PTSD. Service provision was provided formally in six countries (%), and informally in the majority (%). In almost all countries (%), women could be referred to specialist perinatal or mental health services.

Policies, suitable service provision, and training are needed to identify and treat psychological morbidity following a traumatic birth experience, but currently there is little insight into whether and what is provided in different contexts. The aim of this knowledge mapping exercise was to map policy, service and training provision for women following a traumatic birth experience in different European countries.Methods: A survey was distributed as part of the COST Action “Perinatal mental health and birth-related trauma: Maximizing best practice and optimal outcomes”. Questions were designed to capture country level data; care provision (i.e., national policies or guidelines for the screening, treatment and/or prevention of a traumatic birth, service provision), and nationally mandated pre-registration and post-registration training for maternity professionals.Results: Eighteen countries participated. Only one country (the Netherlands) had national policies regarding the screening, treatment, and prevention of a traumatic birth experience/CB-PTSD. Service provision was provided formally in six countries (%), and informally in the majority (%). In almost all countries (%), women could be referred to specialist perinatal or mental health services. Services tended to be provided by midwives, although some multidisciplinary practice was apparent. Seven (%) of the countries offered ‘a few hours’ professional/pre-registration training, but none offered nationally mandated post-registration training.Conclusions: A traumatic birth experience is a key public health concern.

To date, evidence on risk factors and the prognostic impact of delirium on outcomes remains sparse in this patient population.Method: In this prospective observational cohort study at a single tertiary-care center, , cancer patients were enrolled. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were utilized to identify associations between predisposing and precipitating factors and delirium. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the effect of delirium on death rate.Results: In our patient cohort, the prevalence of delirium was .%. Delirium was associated inter alia with prolonged hospitalization, a doubling of care requirements, increased healthcare costs, increased need for institutionalization (OR .), and increased mortality (OR .). Predisposing factors for delirium were impaired activity (OR .), frailty (OR .); hearing (OR .) and visual impairment (OR .), chronic pneumonitis (OR .), hypertension (OR .), and renal insufficiency (OR .). Precipitating factors were acute renal failure (OR .), pressure sores (OR .), pain (OR .), and cystitis (OR .). On multivariate Cox regression, delirium increased the mortality risk sixfold (HR .). Age ≥  years and comorbidities further doubled the mortality risk of delirious patients (HR .; HR .).Significance of results: Delirium is common in cancer patients and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Systematically categorizing predisposing and precipitating factors might yield new strategies for preventing and managing delirium in cancer patients.","doc_id":19514,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21813","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Discovery of a class of potent and selective non‐competitive sentrin‐specific protease 1 inhibitors","authors":"Lindenmann, Urs; Brand, Michael; Gall, Flavio; Frasson, David; Hunziker, Lukas; Kroslakova, Ivana; Sievers, Martin; Riedl, Rainer","subject":"Drug design; Drug discovery; Inhibitors; Medicinal chemistry; Structure-activity relationship;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Discovery of a class of potent and selective non‐competitive sentrin‐specific protease  inhibitors; Drug design; Drug discovery; Inhibitors; Medicinal chemistry; Structure-activity relationship;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; Sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) are responsible for the maturation of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) and the deconjugation of SUMOs from their substrate proteins.

Denn die steigende Lebenserwartung führt in Kombination mit der sinkenden Geburtenrate und vermehrten Teilzeit-Pensen zu immer geringeren Beträgen aus der . und . Säule. Die Bevölkerung ist also dazu angehalten, privat vorzusorgen. Beliebt ist hierbei vor allem die . Säule. Jedoch wird innerhalb der . Säule generell nach Grundsätzen der Modern Portfolio Theory angelegt, welche bereits seit den er-Jahren beinahe unverändert umgesetzt werden. Dabei wird versucht, die Volatilität zu minimieren und den Return zu maximieren. Abstrakte Begriffe wie diese sind aber für die wenigsten Menschen tatsächlich greifbar. Derzeit ist eine weitere Anlagestrategie vor allem im angelsächsischen Raum beliebt und wird in der Literatur gelobt: Zielbasiertes Investieren (ZBI). Dieses beratungsintensive Konzept sieht vor, individuell für Ziele zu sparen und dabei nur so viel Risiko einzugehen, wie es braucht, um diese Ziele zu erreichen. Im Grunde genommen handelt es sich dabei um ein «individuelles ALM» für Privatpersonen. Vor allem im Vorsorge-Kontext erscheint es sinnvoll, zielbasierte Anlagestrategien umzusetzen. Denn mittels ZBI kann diszipliniert und ohne Willkür für die Rente gespart werden. Es stellt sich in diesem Kontext die Frage, ob ZBI auch am Schweizer Markt gefragt ist, da das Angebot bisher überwiegend aus den USA stammt. Um dieser Frage nachzugehen, wurden einerseits Interviews mit elf Schweizer Vorsorgeexperten und andererseits eine Online-Umfrage unter der Schweizer Bevölkerung durchgeführt. Die Experten sehen aufgrund der Individualität, Dynamik und Objektivität mehrheitlich grosses Potenzial in ZBI. Als Herausforderungen werden die Disziplin der Anlegenden, die komplexen Modelle sowie eingeschränkte Flexibilität genannt. Für viele Experten ist die breite Öffentlichkeit die Zielgruppe. Für die Online-Umfrage wurden  Datensätze analysiert. Die Repräsentativität ist zwar unter anderem aufgrund der geringen Teilnehmendenzahl eingeschränkt, jedoch konnten trotzdem wichtige Erkenntnisse gewonnen werden. Die Mehrheit der Befragten sieht Potenzial in ZBI als private Vorsorgelösung und würde sich auch entsprechend beraten lassen. Einige der Teilnehmenden loben den Ansatz als «ausgewogen», andere haben allerdings Sicherheitsbedenken beim Thema «Investieren». Weitere Analysen liefern Hinweise darauf, dass das Konzept generell – unabhängig von Faktoren wie Bildung oder Branchenerfahrung – mit positiven Aspekten assoziiert wird. Es lässt sich zudem ableiten, dass Personen zwischen  und  Jahren eher für ZBI offen sind als ältere Menschen und Frauen im Allgemeinen etwas kritischer eingestellt sind als Männer. Betrachtet man den derzeitigen Boom von Robo-Advisors und Angebote wie VIAC, dann lässt sich sagen, dass die Schweiz für ein ZBI-Vorsorge-Angebot bereit zu sein scheint. Für die Praxis wäre es nun wichtig, weitere Analysen zu betreiben, um ZBI am Markt zu positionieren, und nach einer Etablierung die tatsächliche Performance zu untersuchen, da entsprechende Daten bisher fehlen.","doc_id":19551,"prior":"Lebenserwartung","SDG3":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23685","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Vitamin-D-Mangel und Gestationsdiabetes mellitus : gibt es einen Zusammenhang?","authors":"Fässler, Selina; Eigenmann, Barbara","subject":"Vitamin d; Vitamin-D; Vitamin d deficiency; Vitamin-D-Mangel; Gestational diabetes; Gestationsdiabetes mellitus;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"618","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Vitamin-D-Mangel und Gestationsdiabetes mellitus : gibt es einen Zusammenhang?; Vitamin d; Vitamin-D; Vitamin d deficiency; Vitamin-D-Mangel; Gestational diabetes; Gestationsdiabetes mellitus;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Darstellung des Themas: Ein Gestationsdiabetes mellitus ist eine der häufigsten Schwangerschaftskomplikationen und dessen Prävalenz ist steigend.

Machine learning algorithms for fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis are popular and easily accessible. However, our experience in working at the intersection of academia and industry showed that the major challenges of building an end-to-end system in a real-world industrial setting go beyond the design of machine learning algorithms. One of the major challenges is the design of an end-to-end data management solution that is able to efficiently store and process large amounts of heterogeneous data streams resulting from a variety of physical machines. In this paper we present the design of an end-to-end Big Data architecture that enables intelligent maintenance in a real-world industrial setting. In particular, we will discuss various physical design choices for optimizing high-dimensional queries, such as partitioning and Z-ordering, that serve as the basis for health analytics. Finally, we describe a concrete fault detection use case with two different health monitoring algorithms based on machine learning and classical statistics and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The paper covers some of the most important aspects of the practical implementation of such an end-to-end solution and demonstrates the challenges and their mitigation for the specific application of laser cutting machines.","doc_id":19591,"prior":"health","posterior":"accessible","SDG3":1},{"id":"93","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3295","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Tissue Engineering - the gateway to regenerative medicine","authors":"Bono, Epifania; Mathes, Stephanie H; Franscini, Nicola; Graf-Hausner, Ursula","subject":"Icbc; Automation; Biomaterials; Disc regeneration; Soft tissue; Tissue regeneration;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Tissue Engineering - the gateway to regenerative medicine; Icbc; Automation; Biomaterials; Disc regeneration; Soft tissue; Tissue regeneration;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Tissue Engineering as an emerging biotechnology sector aims at the in vitro regeneration of diseased tissues and promises to profoundly change medical practice, offering the possibility of regenerating tissues and organs instead of just repairing them (regenerative medicine).

Since occupational therapy is a crucial treatment in this domain, it is necessary to understand the occupational needs of persons suffering from mental illness to provide effective treatment.Objectives: To explore the meanings that persons suffering from an acute mental illness attribute to occupations during their stay at a clinic.Method: The data for this study was taken from two in-depth interviews, conducted with each of the six participants. The analysis was guided by hermeneutic principles. The first interview was conducted during the clinical stay to gain \"pre-understanding\" through structural analysis. The second interview took place three months after discharge to deepen the understanding of participants' perceptions. To comply with trustworthiness the study was peer-reviewed and the emerging themes were member-checked.Results: The findings focus on three themes: \"Meaninglessness\", \"Joining in\" and \"Finding oneself\". \"Meaninglessness\" describes the condition of not being involved in meaningful occupation. \"Joining in\" demonstrates to be engaged in an occupation, but without an individual motivation. \"Finding oneself\" illustrate the performance of occupation to reconstruct the own personality.Conclusion: The findings can be interpreted as a process to reconstruct occupational identity. The incipient theme \"Meaninlessness\" can be interpreted as a state of occupational dysfunction. To gain occupational identity again, participants of this study experienced their own abilities through \"Joining in\" any activities. Bottom-up on the rebuilt self-perception a new perspective for the future can actively be searched through occupations described in the theme \"Finding oneself\". This process can be compared to Hammells synthesis of \"doing, belonging, being and becoming\".Contribution to the practice / evidence base of occupational therapy: The findings of the study were applied to an occupational therapy program in mental health care in Switzerland. The constructs of \"Meaninglessness\", \"Joining in\" and \"Finding oneself\" guided clients in their recovery of being active and experiencing occupational identity during their occupational therapy process.","doc_id":19621,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23115","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Stalking im Jugendalter : Prävalenz und Zusammenhänge mit psychischer Befindlichkeit","authors":"Kliem, Sören; Krieg, Yvonne; Baier, Dirk","subject":"Stalking; Prävalenz; Schülerbefragung; Niedersachsensurvey; Prevalence rate; Student survey; Lower Saxony survey;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Kriminologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"305, 364","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Stalking im Jugendalter : Prävalenz und Zusammenhänge mit psychischer Befindlichkeit; Stalking in adolescence : prevalence and correlations with mental health; Stalking; Prävalenz; Schülerbefragung; Niedersachsensurvey; Prevalence rate; Student survey; Lower Saxony survey;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Kriminologie; Die elektronischen Supplemente sind mit der Online-Version dieses Artikels verfügbar unter https://doi.org/./-/a- ESM .Flowchart des Niedersachsensurveys ; Theoretischer Hintergrund: Die Folgen für Betroffene von Stalking reichen von der Beeinträchtigung des sozialen Wohlbefindens über negative wirtschaftliche Folgen bis hin zu gesundheitlichen und psychischen Problemen.Fragestellung: Diese Studie präsentiert erstmalig die Lebenszeitprävalenz für die Opferwerdung von Stalking unter deutschen Jugendlichen und berichtet Zusammenhängemit der psychischen Befindlichkeit.Methode: Daten einer repräsentativen Schüler_innenbefragung in Niedersachsen werden mittels T-Tests und χ-Test überprüft.Ergebnisse: Die Ergebnisse weisen auf eine Prävalenz von .% von Stalking hin, die bei Mädchen und Jugendlichen höher ausfällt als bei Jungen und Erwachsenen.

It has been reported that caregiving can be challenging for family members and might confront family members with concerns to be addressed with health care professionals. Therefore, within a nurse-led family-centered counseling program aiming to support family caregivers by providing therapeutic conversations according to the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention model, we explored the concerns of family members when seeking individualized counseling sessions.Methods: Qualitative design using therapeutic conversations with family members of the elderly. Tape-recorded counseling sessions have been analyzed using content analysis methodology according to Mayring.Results: Family members seeking counselling were primarily adult children (n= [ women]; .%), followed by partners (n= [ wives]; .%) and children in law (n= [ sons in law]; %) and others (n= [friends, neighbor, professional caregiver]; %). The main topics were the need a) to outline and include current developments into the family story, b) to address loss and strains due to disease and deterioration in health of the elderly, c) to focus on former strategies and conflicts with the elderly managing the illness consequences and d) to highlight excessive demand to own resources and its consequences to own physical and mental health. Due to counselling strategies family members could consider new coping strategies and were able to adapt their plans.Discussion: Family members primarily sought counseling to be able to outline their own situation in caregiving and to be supported in finding new meaning and strategies. According to the different topics, counseling has to focus on the main challenges family member address in counseling sessions. Individual tailoring according to the primary concern is pivotal to help family members to concentrate on their resources, find new meaning and coming up with feasible plans that strengthens the family.","doc_id":19788,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20300","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"An approach towards a GMP compliant in-vitro expansion of human adipose stem cells for autologous therapies","authors":"Jossen, Valentin; Muoio, Francesco; Panella, Stefano; Harder, Yves; Tallone, Tiziano; Eibl-Schindler, Regine","subject":"Human adipose stem cells (hASCs); Serum- and xeno-free condition; UrSuppe stem cell culture medium; Autologous therapy; Kinetic growth modeling; Segregated and unstructured growth model;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Biotechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610, 660.6","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"An approach towards a GMP compliant in-vitro expansion of human adipose stem cells for autologous therapies; Human adipose stem cells (hASCs); Serum- and xeno-free condition; UrSuppe stem cell culture medium; Autologous therapy; Kinetic growth modeling; Segregated and unstructured growth model;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Biotechnologie; Human Adipose Tissue Stem Cells (hASCs) are a valuable source of cells for clinical applications (e.g., treatment of acute myocardial infarction and inflammatory diseases), especially in the field of regenerative medicine.

The aim of this study was to develop anti-fungal lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-yeast co-cultures by selecting anti-fungal strains best adapted to the cocoa bean fermentation process from  LAB and  yeast strains isolated from cocoa bean post-harvest processes. The applied multiphasic screening approach included anti-fungal activity tests in vitro and in vivo and assessment of the carbon metabolism and stress tolerance of the anti-fungal strains in cocoa pulp simulation medium. The anti-fungal strains, Lactobacillus fermentum M, Lactobacillus fermentum , Hanseniaspora opuntiae H, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae H, were selected based on their high inhibition capacity and their well-adapted metabolism. Up to seven filamentous fungal strains of the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Gibberella were inhibited by  and % of the maximal inhibition zone by M and , respectively, and by  and % by the strains H and H, respectively. Both Lb. fermentum strains converted the medium's glucose, fructose, and citric acid into .–. g/l of mannitol, .–. g/l acetic acid, and .–. g/l lactic acid, whereas the two yeast strains metabolized glucose and fructose to produce .–. g/l of ethanol. The Lb. fermentum strains were further characterized as ethanol, acetic acid, and temperature tolerant and both yeast strains as ethanol and lactic acid tolerant. Finally, the anti-fungal in vivo assays revealed that the two Lb. fermentum strains completely inhibited growth of the citrinin-producing strain, P. citrinum S, and the potentially fumonisin-producing strain, G. moniliformis S, on the surface of cocoa beans. All four selected anti-fungal strains, i.e. Lb. fermentum M, Lb. fermentum , H. opuntiae H, and Sacc. cerevisiae H, inhibited at –% growth of aflatoxin-producer A. flavus S as single cultures while preventing its growth by % when combined into four co-cultures, each composed of a Lb. fermentum strain and one of the two yeast strains. As a conclusion, these four LAB-yeast co-cultures are recommended for future applications to limit the growth of filamentous fungi and the concomitant mycotoxin production during the fermentation of cocoa beans.","doc_id":19934,"prior":"health risk","SDG3":1},{"id":"7","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12436","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Malignant fungating wounds : a survey of nurses clinical practice in Switzerland","authors":"Probst, Sebastian; Arber, A.; Faithfull, S.","subject":"Bandages; Transudates; Neoplasms; Exudates;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Malignant fungating wounds : a survey of nurses clinical practice in Switzerland; Bandages; Transudates; Neoplasms; Exudates;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Background: The care of individuals with a fungating malignant wound represents challenging cancer management not only for patients and their families but also for health care professionals. Understanding the difficulties faced by nurses when they care for patients with such a wound can help guide practice and service development. The aim of this study was to investigate how many patients with a malignant fungating wounds did nurses see and what kind of difficulties in caring for patients with a malignant fungating wound did nurses experience.

The theory offers a lot of material. In practice, varieties of strategy formulations are in place. Also in hospitals. The corporate strategy (or at least parts of it) are often publicly available on hospital’s websites. But what about their Facility Management (FM) strategies? There was no discussed overview of FM-strategies used in Swiss hospital available.Purpose: This paper is about the research being applied to describe the current use of FM-strategies in Swiss acute hospitals.Methodology: Based on theory about corporate strategy, health care and facility management, a quantitative online survey was compiled. The survey was sent to FM leaders (C-level) in  German-Swiss acute hospitals. It was answered by  participants (response rate %). Additionally, the websites of  university and cantonal hospitals were analyzed in order to find out what is openly accessible on the subject of strategy. Data was primarily analyzed with descriptive statistics.Results: One third of the hospitals do not have a clearly defined FM-strategy. With regard to the total number of Swiss hospitals, it can be assumed that this number is much larger. Additionally, it was determined for which FM areas strategies were formulated, which contents they cover, where the documents are published and how strategy implementation is ensured. Although this research relates to Switzerland, it can be assumed that many results also apply to other countries.Conclusion: The research led to an initial systematic overview of how Swiss hospitals use FM-strategies. Already that alone should encourage hospitals to reflect their (not) existing FM strategies and possibly proactively adjust them, so that their potential for the core processes benefit will be fully exploited. Although this research relates to Switzerland, it can be assumed that numerous results also apply to other countries.Unique value to the body of FM knowledge: It provides the foundations for further research into hospitals’ application of FM-strategies. An area whose potential for the benefit of hospitals core processes has not yet been fully exploited.","doc_id":20033,"prior":"health","posterior":"accessible","SDG3":1},{"id":"8","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/223","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Produktiv sein – Das Erleben von brustkrebsbetroffenen Frauen : Mögliche Herausforderungen in der Ausführung der Produktivität von Frauen nach der primären Brustkrebsbehandlung","authors":"Indermühle, Yvonne; Sutter, Vanessa Magdalena","subject":"breast neoplasms/breast cancer; post-treatment; productivity; occupation; work ability; adaptation; occupational therapy;  Ergotherapie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.8515","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Produktiv sein – Das Erleben von brustkrebsbetroffenen Frauen : Mögliche Herausforderungen in der Ausführung der Produktivität von Frauen nach der primären Brustkrebsbehandlung; breast neoplasms/breast cancer; post-treatment; productivity; occupation; work ability; adaptation; occupational therapy;  Ergotherapie; Darstellung des Themas: Weltweit ist Brustkrebs die häufigste Krebsdiagnose bei Frauen.

A total of , individuals' data were included. Multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was employed to estimate the probability of very good and good health within the framework of a hierarchical cross-classified age-period-cohort model (HAPC), adjusting for education level, gender, civil status, smoking status and body mass index.Results: Individuals with higher education were substantially more likely than those with primary education to report good SRH (OR = .; % CI = .–. for secondary education and OR = .; % CI = .–. for tertiary education). The education effect depended on birth cohort and age: higher proportions of good SRH were reported by secondary (%–%) and tertiary (%–%) compared with primary educated individuals from the  birth cohort onward; the proportion of secondary/tertiary (compared to primary) educated people reporting good SRH increased with age (by /% at – years and /% at – years). Gender health equality was achieved by the  (primary educated) and  (secondary educated) birth cohorts, while these women overtook men in reporting good SRH from the  birth cohort onward. Tertiary educated younger women were significantly less likely to report good SRH than men but parity was achieved at around pension age. Similarly, gender inequality in those with primary and secondary education reduced in the younger ages to not be significant at around age , with women overtaking men from age .Conclusions: Younger birth cohorts with lower education levels appear most vulnerable in terms of their SRH. The education effect cumulatively increases when attaining incrementally higher education levels. While women report lower health than men, gender inequality in SRH has declined and even reversed over time and is substantially linked to differences in educational status. Swiss public health strategies should particularly target the younger adults with only primary school education of both genders; for women, to combat health burdens in their early life, and men, to mitigate issues in their later life.","doc_id":20370,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2761","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Emodin : a compound with putative antidiabetic potential, deteriorates glucose tolerance in rodents","authors":"Abu Eid, Sameer; Adams, Michael; Scherer, Thomas; Torres-Gómez, Héctor Manuel; Hackl, Martina Theresa; Kaplanian, Mairam; Riedl, Rainer; Luger, Anton; Fürnsinn, Clemens","subject":"Glucose; Emodin; Diabetes;  Biochemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 615","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Emodin : a compound with putative antidiabetic potential, deteriorates glucose tolerance in rodents; Glucose; Emodin; Diabetes;  Biochemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; Emodin is found in remedies from Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since antihyperglycaemic action was observed in rodents, non-scientific sources advertise emodin intake as a natural cure for diabetes. Emodin was admixed to high fat-food of obese mice at two doses ( and  g/kg; daily emodin uptake  and  mg/kg). Comparison was made to ad libitum fed and to food restricted control groups, the latter showing the same weight gain as the corresponding emodin-treated groups. Emodin blunted food intake by % and % for the low and high dose, which was accompanied by proportionate reductions in weight gain. Emodin reduced blood glucose relative to freely feeding controls, but comparison to weight-matched controls unmasked deterioration, rather than improvement, of basal glycaemia (mmol/l: fed ad libitum, .±.; low emodin, .±., weight-matched, .±.; high emodin, .±., weight-matched, .±.; P<., emodin vs weight-matched) and glucose tolerance (area under the curve, min*mol/l: fed ad libitum, .±.; low emodin, .±., weight-matched, .±.; high emodin, .±., weight-matched, .±.; P<., emodin vs weight-matched). An insulin tolerance test suggested insulin desensitisation by prolonged emodin treatment.

We introduce a conceptual framework that may help explain why this controversy continues. The framework distinguishes between internal and ecological requirements of assessment tools. First, existing frameworks have primarily focused on internal requirements that refer to the psychometric qualities of a tool, which are theoretically independent of the organisational context. For these internal requirements, we suggest a distinction between three types of validity: construct validity, predictive validity, and indicative validity. Second, the degree of fit with the ecological requirements determines how well the tool works in a specific organisation: for example, whether a tool makes sense to practitioners, whether they readily adopt or tacitly adapt it, or how well it fits with the objectives of the organisation and the goals of individual workers. We define four such requirements: adequacy, organisational suitability, practicality, and utility. The framework is illustrated with data from an ethnographic study in Switzerland. The framework leads to questions that may guide managers and frontline workers in developing, implementing, and evaluating standardised risk assessment in child protection.","doc_id":20421,"prior":"Kindesmisshandlung","SDG3":1},{"id":"80","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11540","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Die Akzeptanz von E-Learning als Instrument einer lernenden Organisation : eine Fallstudie anhand der Psychiatrieverbunde des Kantons St.Gallen","authors":"Feldmann, Benjamin","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"362, 371","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Die Akzeptanz von E-Learning als Instrument einer lernenden Organisation : eine Fallstudie anhand der Psychiatrieverbunde des Kantons St.Gallen;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten; Die ständige Weiterentwicklung der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern durch die Just-in-time-Aneignung des benötigten Wissens wird im Lichte der gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung hin zu einer Wissens- und Informationsgesellschaft zu einem wesentlichen Erfolgsfaktor einer Organisation. Bestehendes sowie neu erlangtes Wissen der Mitarbeitenden muss der Organisation zugänglich gemacht werden. E-Learning ist eine mögliche Antwort auf diese Herausforderungen und ermöglicht die Transformation zu einer lernenden Organisation. Die Literaturrecherche zeigte, dass die Akzeptanz von E-Learning in diesem Kontext bisher erst unzureichend erforscht wurde. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht deshalb die Akzeptanz von E-Learning als Instrument einer lernenden Organisation bei den Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern der Psychiatrieverbunde des Kantons St.Gallen.Die kontextspezifische Erweiterung eines bestehenden Technologieakzeptanzmodells dient als theoretische Grundlage für die Bestimmung der Akzeptanz durch persönliche Interviews. Als Resultat lässt sich festhalten, dass bei den meisten interviewten Personen die Akzeptanz gegenüber E-Learning und auch gegenüber dem Einsatz von E-Learning als Instrument einer lernenden Organisation gegeben ist. Letzteres beinhaltet insbesondere die Absicht, für die Wissensgenerierung das bedarfsorientierte Just-in-time-Lernen sowie für den Wissensaustausch in E-Learning-Kursen integrierte Diskussionsforen zu nutzen. Allerdings werden für die Nutzung auch Voraussetzungen bezüglich der Benutzerfreundlichkeit der für das E-Learning genutzten Software und der organisationalen Rahmenbedingungen aufgeführt. Des Weiteren besteht in der Gestaltung eines interaktiven und auf die unterschiedlichen Berufsgruppen abgestimmten Lerninhalts ein Verbesserungspotenzial. Mögliche Hindernisse für die Nutzung von E-Learning sind im fehlenden persönlichen Austausch mit den Arbeitskolleginnen und -kollegen sowie in dem für das bedarfsorientierte Just-in-time-Lernen notwendigen, aber derzeit in der vorherrschenden Lernkultur noch zu wenig ausgeprägten selbstgesteuerten Lernen zu sehen. Durch die Verbindung eines Technologieakzeptanzmodells mit spezifischen Eigenschaften des Einsatzes von E-Learning als Instrument einer lernenden Organisation und durch die darauf basierenden persönlichen Interviews konnte die identifizierte Forschungslücke reduziert werden. Aufgrund der mehrheitlich qualitativen Forschungsmethodik lassen sich die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit jedoch nicht verallgemeinern. Eine zukünftige Studie könnte mit einer quantitativen Forschungsmethodik statistisch signifikante Aussagen zur Akzeptanz von E-Learning als Instrument einer lernenden Organisation ermöglichen. Da insbesondere aufgrund der Lernstile der interviewten Personen grosse Unterschiede in der Bewertung des wahrgenommenen Nutzens festzustellen sind, wäre hierbei die Messung des Einflusses von unterschiedlichen Lernstilen auf den wahrgenommenen Nutzen besonders interessant.","doc_id":20435,"prior":"Gesundheits-","posterior":"zugänglich","SDG3":1},{"id":"87","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4997","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A preliminary study of the effects of trigger timing on diffusion tensor imaging of the human spinal cord","authors":"Summers, Paul; Stämpfli, Philipp; Järmann, Thomas; Kwiecinski, S.; Kollias, S.","subject":" Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"A preliminary study of the effects of trigger timing on diffusion tensor imaging of the human spinal cord;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Background and Purpose: Diffusion tensor and diffusion-weighted spinal cord imaging remain relatively unexplored techniques despite demonstrations that such images can be obtained and may yield clinically relevant findings.

However, recently first attempts have been made to modify existing single-use bioreactors for the cultivation of plant cells and tissue cultures, and microorganisms. This has even led to the development of new single-use bioreactor types. Moreover, due to safety issues it has become clear that single-use bioreactors are the “must have” for expanding human stem cells delivering cell therapeutics, the biopharmaceuticals of the next generation. So it comes as no surprise that numerous different dynamic single-use bioreactor types, which are suitable for a wide range of applications, already dominate the market today. Bioreactor working principles, main applications, and bioengineering data are presented in this review, based on a current overview of greater than milliliter-scale, commercially available, dynamic single-use bioreactors.

We estimate the cost-effectiveness of price subsidies on fortified packaged infant cereals (F-PICs) in reducing IDA in --monthold children in urban India.Materials and Methods: Cost-effectiveness is estimated by comparing the net social cost of price subsidies with the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted with price subsidies. The net social costs correspond to the cost of the subsidy minus the monetary costs saved by reducing IDA. The estimation proceeds in three steps: ) the current lifetime costs of IDA are assessed with a health economic model combining the prevalence of anemia, derived from a large population survey, with information on the health consequences of IDA and their costs in terms of mortality, morbidity, and DALYs. ) The effects of price subsidies on the demand for F-PICs are assessed with a market survey among  households in  large Indian cities. ) The cost-effectiveness is calculated by combining the findings of the first two steps with the results of a systematic review on the effectiveness of F-PICs in reducing IDA. We compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions that differ in the level of the subsidy and in the socio-economic strata (SES) eligible for the subsidy.Results: The lifetime social costs of IDA in --month-old children in large Indian cities amount to production losses of  USD and to , DALYs. Poor households incur the highest costs, yet even wealthier households suffer substantial losses. The market survey reveals that few households currently buy F-PICs, with the share ranging from % to %. Wealthier households are generally more likely to buy FPICs. The costs of the subsidies per DALY averted range from  to  USD. Interventions targeted at poorer households are most effective. Almost all interventions are cost saving from a societal perspective when taking into account the reduction of future production losses. Return per DALY averted ranges between gains of  USD to a cost of  USD.Conclusion: Price subsidies on F-PICs are a cost-effective way to reduce the social costs of IDA in --month-old children in large Indian cities. Interventions targeting poorer households are especially cost-effective.","doc_id":20672,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10590","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Effect of thyroid shielding during mammography : measurements on phantom and patient as well as estimation with Monte Carlo simulation","authors":"Pyka, Miriam; Eschle, Patrik; Sommer, Christian; Weyland, Mathias S.; Kubik, Rahel; Scheidegger, Stephan","subject":"Radiation protection; Mammography;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Effect of thyroid shielding during mammography : measurements on phantom and patient as well as estimation with Monte Carlo simulation; Radiation protection; Mammography;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: During mammography, the thyroid is exposed to scattered radiation from breast tissue and device.

Im urbanen Raum sind Bäume einer Vielzahl von Stressfaktoren ausgesetzt, die ein vitales Wachstum stark einschränken. Häufig werden Stadtbäume nach  bis  Jahren ersetzt. Ein nachhaltiges Management von Stadtbäumen ermöglicht es, langfristig von den Leistungen der Stadtbäume profitieren zu können. Diese Masterarbeit untersucht anhand von Recherchen und Gesprächen mit Fachpersonen, mit welchen Massnahmen in der Planungs-, Bau- und Pflegephase ein solches Stadtbaummanagement zielgerecht umgesetzt werden kann. Eine wichtige Voraussetzung ist die strategische Planung mit einer Bestandsaufnahme, Zielformulierungen sowie Umsetzungs- und Monitoringplänen. Eine fachgerechte Planung stellt den Stadtbäumen genügend ober- und unterirdischen Raum zu Verfügung. Anhand des Standortes kann die zentrale Funktion des Stadtbaumes definiert werden, die dann eine entsprechende Arten- und Sortenwahl ermöglicht. Sind Standort und Baumart festgelegt, erfolgt die Planung der Baumgrube, des Wurzelbereichs, der Bewässerungs- und Belüftungssysteme und der Substratzusammensetzung. Eine standortgerechte Gestaltung der Baumscheibe und eine fachgerechte Baumpflanzung gehören ebenfalls zu den planerischen und baulichen Massnahmen. In der Pflegephase sind eine artspezifische, periodische Jungbaumpflege mit bedarfsgerechten Wasser- und Nährstoffgaben, Gehölzschnitte zur Erzielung der gewünschten Kronenform und Verhinderung von Problemstellungen sowie Baumkontrollen zur Garantie der Verkehrssicherheit erforderlich. Manuelle Bewässerungsmethoden, der Einsatz von Pflanzenernährungs- und Pflanzenschutzmittel spielen im urbanen Raum eine untergeordnete Rolle. Wichtiger sind prophylaktische Massnahmen, die entsprechende Defizite verhindern. Ein differenzierter Winterdienst, der neben Sicherheitsaspekten und ökonomischen Kriterien die Umweltbelastung durch Streusalze miteinbezieht, und ein fachgerecht umgesetzter Baumschutz auf Baustellen sind ebenfalls von Bedeutung in der Pflegephase. Zu einem nachhaltigen Management von Stadtbäumen gehört ein effizientes Schädlingsmanagement. In einem Feldversuch wird das Untersuchungs- und Anwendungsregime in der biologischen Bekämpfung des Buchsbaumzünslers (Diaphania perspectalis) analysiert. Die Ergebnisse des Feldversuches können aufgrund des tiefen Befallsdrucks ausgewertet werden. Recherchen zeigen, dass regelmässige Untersuchungen der Buchspflanzen notwendig sind, um die Larven frühzeitig zu bekämpfen. Dadurch können die beachtlichen Schäden, die der Buchsbaumzünsler zu verursachen vermag, verhindert werden. Zur Bekämpfung hat sich ein biokonformes Insektizid auf Basis der von Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki erzeugten Toxine etabliert.Trees with large crown volume and corresponding age provide a wide range of ecosystem services. The urban environment, with its many constraints, limits the average lifespan of a tree to only  to  years. Urban forestry aims to increase longevity and the vitality of urban trees for the purpose of a long-term benefit from the services they provide. This Master’s Thesis examines specific principles in planning, constructing and maintaining urban forests. A key aspect is a strategic management plan with a current state analysis, a vision and goals as well as an implementation and monitoring plan. Strategic planning creates tree places with sufficient soil volume for root growth and aerial space for tree crown spread and development. The selection of tree species should depend on the function, that is, the desired benefits from a tree. Tree species and planting site conditions influence the layout of the planting site including soil composition, irrigation and ventilation systems. Surface opening treatment and professional tree planting also belong to the planning and construction measures. Maintenance measures include a species-specific, post-planting care with a needs-based water and nutrient supply, pruning to achieve the desired crown shape and prevent problematic growth, and tree control to guarantee road safety. Manual irrigation methods as well as the use of plant nutrition and pesticides play a subordinate role in the urban context; more important are prophylactic measures to prevent corresponding deficits. An economic use of de-icing salt, which mitigates salt damage to trees without limiting safety, and professionally implemented tree protection on construction sites are also important in the maintenance phase. Sustainable urban forestry also includes effective pest management. In a field experiment, the examination and application routine for the biological control of Diaphania perspectalis (the box-tree pyralid) was analysed. Due to low infestation, the results were inconclusive. Research shows that regular, consistent monitoring is necessary and enables early control measures against young larvae, thereby preventing considerable damage. For pest control, a biocompliant insecticide on the basis of toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki is now commonly used.","doc_id":20710,"prior":"Lebenserwartung","SDG3":1},{"id":"78","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1968","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Use of herbal medicine in the management of trypanosomiasis in Angola","authors":"Vahekeni, N; Neto Pedro, M; Kayimbo Malilo, K; van Eeuwijk, P; Mäser, P; João Pedro, G; Théophile, J; Wolfram, Evelyn; da Costa, E; Falquet, J","subject":" Pflanzen (Botanik);  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Biotechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"580, 615, 660.6","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Use of herbal medicine in the management of trypanosomiasis in Angola;  Pflanzen (Botanik);  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Biotechnologie; More than  per cent of the Angolan population relies on herbal remedies to treat various ailments.

The aim of this study is to present the approximated overall and sex-specific cumulative incidence of mental disorder in the Zurich cohort study, a prospective cohort study of - years olds from the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, who were followed through age . A stratified sample of  participants were interviewed with the Structured Psychopathological Interview and Rating of the Social Consequences of Psychological Disturbances for Epidemiology, a semi-structured interview that uses a bottom-up approach to assess the past-year presence of  psychiatric syndromes. Seven interview waves took place between  and . Approximated cumulative incidence was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Rates of mental disorder were considerably higher than those generally reported in cross-sectional surveys. We found rates ranging from .% for major depressive disorder to .% for Bipolar I disorder. The cumulative probability of experiencing any of the mental disorders assessed by age  was .%, the highest reported to date. We also found that rates differed by sex for most disorders, with females generally reporting higher rates of mood, anxiety and phobic disorder, and males reporting higher rates of substance- and alcohol-related disorders. These findings confirm those of other long-term prospective studies that indicate the nearly universal nature of disturbances of emotion and behaviour across the life span. Greater community awareness of the normative nature of these experiences is warranted. An important area of future research is study long-term course and stability to determine who among those with such disturbances suffer from chronic disabling mental disorders.

Cannabis users showed more distress, less positive health behaviour and higher hedonism compared to non-users. Taking motive for use as a moderator variable into consideration, it became evident that only cannabis users with coping motives showed lower mental health,more symptoms of psychopathology, more psychosocial distress and more life events than non-users. Young adults with social motives for use on the other hand did not differ from non-users in terms of distress. These differences between cannabis users with social and those with coping motives remained stable over two years.

Four organisations implemented activity-based working and two organisations moved and centralised to modern office buildings. In a longitudinal design with a control group in each of the organisations the effects of the office environments before and after the change were measured using surveys and expert assessments of the office designs. The change management process was documented and data on end-users’ experiences were collected through “pulse-checks” (short questionnaires that were used several times during the change process). A total of  office users participated in the study; the longitudinal sample consists of  datasets.Findings: Longitudinal comparisons of means show that the office environment change had different effects on employee wellbeing, health and work engagement in the different organisations. Longitudinal regression analyses show that office environment factors explain -% of variance in different measures of mental wellbeing and about % of variance in work engagement. In each organization, different influencing factors in the office environment and of the workplace change management seem to be important. Further results showed that the evaluation of the office environment and the change process by experts does not correspond to the perception of the employees. Therefore, the objective evaluation of office environments and change processes seems not be suitable in order to infer from this well-being, health and satisfaction of the employees.Practical implications: Results show that workplace changes may have positive or negative effects for mental wellbeing, depending highly on the context. Therefore, thorough pre-change analyses regarding employees’ needs, work activities and the organisational context are essential for the development of future office environments.Originality/value: The originality of the study lies in the topic (deep analysis of mental wellbeing in relation to office environments and workplace change management) and the methodological approach with a longitudinal study of  office environment changes.","doc_id":21358,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9522","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Developing a brief emergency care intervention for severe diabetic hypoglycaemia","authors":"Keller-Senn, Anita; Lee, G.; Imhof, Lorenz; Sturt, J.","subject":" Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Developing a brief emergency care intervention for severe diabetic hypoglycaemia;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":21424,"prior":"diabetic","SDG3":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24601","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Using difference detail curves to assess image quality of low contrast abdominal CT scans","authors":"Sommer, Christian; Özden, Ismail; Weyland, Mathias; Duran, Carolina; Lutters, Gerd; Scheidegger, Stephan","subject":"Low contrast CT; CT image quality; Difference detail curve; CT phantom;  Mathematik;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"510, 616","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Using difference detail curves to assess image quality of low contrast abdominal CT scans; Low contrast CT; CT image quality; Difference detail curve; CT phantom;  Mathematik;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Purpose: The desire for dose- and image quality co-optimization in Computer Tomography (CT) scans presumes the ability to measure radiation exposure and image quality as realistically as possible, in phantoms or preferably in patients.

The continuous growth of international tourism has supported the global economy via job creation and export revenues. Nevertheless, the tourism activities have caused negative impacts on the environment due to the over-exploitation of natural resources and inadequate environmental controls. Eco-tourism is an option that could appeal to tourists who are not interested in conventional holidays. Small businesses in Thailand addressing these ecological aspects can profit from an increase in the number of tourists staying in their hotels and participating in their leisure activities. Conventional travel agencies can expand their product portfolio by offering conventional holidays with a lower environmental impact. To determine environmentally friendly tourism options, an analysis of the environmental impact of both conventional and existing offers is required. This work aimed to assess environmental impacts of tourism activities and to recommend how to design sustainable tourism services with lower environmental impacts throughout the whole life cycle. The case study focuses on tourism activities in Patong, Phuket, Thailand – one of the world’s top tourism destinations. The functional unit was one tourist stay for one night (person.night). The foreground data were collected from one hotel, two hostels,  tourists ( Thais and  foreigners) and Patong municipality. Tourism activities consist of accommodation (hotels and hostels), mobility (airplane, ferry, private car, motorcycle, public bus and public van), leisure activities, food consumption (local, non-local, meat, vegetarian, etc.) and waste and wastewater management. End-point environmental impacts (human health damage, ecosystem damage, and resource scarcity) were assessed by using the ReCiPe  v. method. Criteria for eco-tourism identified as tourism activities with shared facilities, less resource uses and lower environmental impacts were applied for assessing level of eco-tourism in the studied area. Conventional tourism with hotel accommodation; mobility via long-haul flights/private vehicles; and intensive leisure activities had higher environmental impacts than eco-tourism due to the more resource uses per person.night. The mobility had contributed to more than % of all environmental impacts from tourism. The impacts from long haul flights could be partially compensated by the longer period of stay at the tourist destination. Domestic flights yielded lower impacts than domestic mobility via private vehicles. Hotel and hostels have similar environmental impacts from waste and wastewater management. When compared with the foreign tourists, the local tourists had lower environmental impacts due to the shorter mobility distance and the choices of activities. The assessment showed that % of tourists had medium to the highest levels of eco-tourism; and % of tourists had low to the least levels of eco-tourism. Future improvements to reduce environmental impacts from tourism should focus on international and domestic transport services and the length of stay. The improvement of public transport systems in tourist destinations is also needed in order to shift mobility patterns. This research can be applied to allow businesses to provide tourism services in a less environmentally impactful way and to support sustainable tourism policies in Thailand and around the world.","doc_id":21606,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15650","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Health risks associated with meat consumption : a review of epidemiological studies","authors":"Battaglia Richi, Evelyne; Baumer, Beatrice; Conrad, Beatrice; Darioli, Roger; Schmid, Alexandra; Keller, Ulrich","subject":"Cardiovascular disease; Colon cancer; Diabetes type 2; Meat; Mortality; Poultry; Processed meat; Protein; Red meat;  Diätetik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613.2","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Health risks associated with meat consumption : a review of epidemiological studies; Cardiovascular disease; Colon cancer; Diabetes type ; Meat; Mortality; Poultry; Processed meat; Protein; Red meat;  Diätetik; Recent evidence from large prospective US and European cohort studies and from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies indicates that the long-term consumption of increasing amounts of red meat and particularly of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of total mortality, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer and type  diabetes, in both men and women.

The Mother-Generated Index (MGI) is a validated instrument to assess postnatal quality of life. The tool has not been applied for making a cross-cultural comparison before. This study investigated (a) responses to the MGI in German-speaking women in Germany and Switzerland; and (b) associations between MGI scores on the one hand and maternity and midwifery care on the other.Methods: A two-stage survey was conducted in two rural hospitals  km apart, on opposite sides of the German-Swiss border. The questionnaires included the MGI and questions on socio-demographics, physical and mental health and maternity care, and were distributed during the first days after birth and six weeks postpartum. Parametric and non-parametric tests were computed with the statistical programme SPSS.Results: A total of  questionnaires were returned an average of three days after birth and  in the follow-up after seven weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in the MGI scores between the German and the Swiss women (p = .). Significantly more favourable MGI scores were found associated with more adequate information during pregnancy (p = .), a more satisfactory birth experience (p < .), epidural anaesthesia (p < .), more information (p = .) and better support (p = .) during the time in hospital and less disturbed sleep (p < .). Significantly lower MGI scores were associated with the presence of a private doctor during birth (p = .) and with exclusive breastfeeding during the first postnatal days (p = .).Conclusion: The MGI scores of these German-speaking women were higher than those in other studies reported previously. Thus the tool may be able to detect differences in postnatal quality of life among women with substantially divergent cultural backgrounds. Shortcomings in maternity and midwifery care were detected, as for example the inadequate provision of information during pregnancy, a lack of individualised postpartum care during the hospital stay and insufficient support for exclusively breastfeeding mothers. The MGI is an appropriate instrument for maternity care outcome measurement in cross-cultural comparison research.","doc_id":21726,"prior":"mental health","SDG3":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21281","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Selecting home care quality indicators based on the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) for Switzerland : a public health and healthcare providers' perspective","authors":"Wagner, Aylin; Zúñiga, Franziska; Rüesch, Peter; Schaffert, René; Dratva, Julia","subject":"Spitex; Qualitätsindikator; Qualitätsmessung; Pflege; Delphi-Methode;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Selecting home care quality indicators based on the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) for Switzerland : a public health and healthcare providers' perspective; Spitex; Qualitätsindikator; Qualitätsmessung; Pflege; Delphi-Methode;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Background: Despite an increasing importance of home care, quality assurance in this healthcare sector in Switzerland is hardly established. In , Swiss home care quality indicators (QIs) based on the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) were developed. However, these QIs have not been revised since, although internationally new RAI-HC QIs have emerged. The objective of this study was to assess the appropriateness of RAI-HC QIs to measure quality of home care in Switzerland from a public health and healthcare providers’ perspective.Methods: First, the appropriateness of RAI-HC QIs, identified in a recent systematic review, was assessed by a multidisciplinary expert panel based on the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method taking into account indicators’ public health relevance, potential of influence, and comprehensibility. Second, the QIs selected by the experts were afterwards rated regarding their relevance, potential of influence, and practicability from a healthcare providers’ perspective in focus groups with home care nurses based on the Nominal-Group-Technique. Data were analyzed using median scores and the Disagreement Index.Results:  of  RAI-HC QIs were rated appropriate by the experts from a public health perspective. The  QIs cover clinical, psychosocial, functional and service use aspects. Seven of the  QIs were subsequently rated appropriate by home care nurses from a healthcare providers’ perspective. The focus of these QIs is narrow, because three of seven QIs are pain-related. From both perspectives, the majority of RAI-HC QIs were rated inappropriate because of insufficient potential of influence, with healthcare providers rating them more critically.Conclusions: The study shows that the appropriateness of RAI-HC QIs differs according to the stakeholder perspective and the intended use of QIs. The findings of this study can guide policy-makers and home care organizations on selecting QIs and to critically reflect on their appropriate use.","doc_id":21748,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21977","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Death in delirious palliative-care patients occurs irrespective of age : a prospective, observational cohort study of 229 delirious palliative-care patients","authors":"Seiler, Annina; Blum, David; Hertler, Caroline; Schettle, Markus; Zipser, Carl Moritz; Bode, Leonie; Gehrke, Samuel; Ernst, Jutta; Schubert, Maria; von Känel, Roland; Boettger, Soenke","subject":"Delirium; Palliative-care patient; Precipitating factor; Predisposing factor;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Death in delirious palliative-care patients occurs irrespective of age : a prospective, observational cohort study of  delirious palliative-care patients; Delirium; Palliative-care patient; Precipitating factor; Predisposing factor;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch)A corrigendum to this article was published in Palliative & Supportive Care (), June , pp. . https://doi.org/./S; Objectives:Patients with terminal illness are at high risk of developing delirium, in particular, those with multiple predisposing and precipitating risk factors. Delirium in palliative care is largely under-researched, and few studies have systematically assessed key aspects of delirium in elderly, palliative-care patients.Methods: In this prospective, observational cohort study at a tertiary care center,  delirious palliative-care patients stratified by age: < (N = ) and ≥ years (N = ), were analyzed with logistic regression models to identify associations with respect to predisposing and precipitating factors.Results:In % of the patients, the underlying diagnosis was cancer. Mortality rate and median time to death did not differ significantly between the two age groups. No intergroup differences were detected with respect to gender, care requirements, length of hospital stay, or medical costs. In patients ≥ years, exclusively predisposing factors were relevant for delirium, including hearing impairment [odds ratio (OR) .; confidence interval (CI) .– .; P < .], hypertonia (OR .; CI .–.; P < .), and chronic kidney disease (OR .; CI .–.; P = .). In contrast, in patients < years, only precipitating factors were relevant for delirium, including cerebral edema (OR .; CI .–.; P = .). Significance of results:The results of this study demonstrate that death in delirious palliativecare patients occurs irrespective of age. The multifactorial nature and adverse outcomes of delirium across all age in these patients require clinical recognition. Potentially reversible factors should be detected early to prevent or mitigate delirium and its poor survival outcomes.","doc_id":21751,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21753","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Primary resistance mechanism of the canine distemper virus fusion protein against a small-molecule membrane fusion inhibitor","authors":"Kalbermatter, David; Shrestha, Neeta; Ader-Ebert, Nadine; Herren, Michael; Moll, Pascal; Plemper, Richard K.; Altmann, Karl-Heinz; Langedijk, Johannes P.; Gall, Flavio; Lindenmann, Urs; Riedl, Rainer; Fotiadis, Dimitrios; Plattet, Philippe","subject":"Fusion inhibitors; Fusion protein; Head-stalk interface; Morbillivirus cell entry; Prefusion state stabilization; Amino acid sequence; Animal; Antiviral agent; Cell line; Chlorocebus aethiop; Distemper; Canine distemper virus; Molecular model; Mutation; Protein conformation; Vero cells; Viral fusion proteins; Viral drug resistance;  Mikrobiologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"579","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Primary resistance mechanism of the canine distemper virus fusion protein against a small-molecule membrane fusion inhibitor; Fusion inhibitors; Fusion protein; Head-stalk interface; Morbillivirus cell entry; Prefusion state stabilization; Amino acid sequence; Animal; Antiviral agent; Cell line; Chlorocebus aethiop; Distemper; Canine distemper virus; Molecular model; Mutation; Protein conformation; Vero cells; Viral fusion proteins; Viral drug resistance;  Mikrobiologie; Morbilliviruses (e.g. measles virus [MeV] or canine distemper virus [CDV]) employ the attachment (H) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins for cell entry. H protein engagement to a cognate receptor eventually leads to F-triggering. Upon activation, F proteins transit from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation; a refolding process that is associated with membrane merging. Small-molecule morbilliviral fusion inhibitors such as the compound G (a chemical analog in the AS- class) were previously generated and mechanistic studies revealed a stabilizing effect on morbilliviral prefusion F trimers. Here, we aimed at designing G-resistant CDV F mutants by introducing single cysteine residues at hydrophobic core positions of the helical stalk region. Covalently-linked F dimers were generated, which highlighted substantial conformational flexibility within the stalk to achieve those irregular F conformations. Our findings demonstrate that \"top-stalk\" CDV F cysteine mutants (F-VC and F-LC) remained functional and gained resistance to G. Conversely, although not all \"bottom-stalk\" F cysteine variants preserved proper bioactivity, those that remained functional exhibited G-sensitivity. According to the recently determined prefusion MeV F trimer/AS- co-crystal structure, CDV residues F-V and F-L may directly interact with G. A combination of conformation-specific anti-F antibodies and low-resolution electron microscopy structural analyses confirmed that G lost its stabilizing effect on \"top-stalk\" F cysteine mutants thus suggesting a primary resistance mechanism. Overall, our data suggest that the fusion inhibitor G stabilizes prefusion CDV F trimers by docking at the top of the stalk domain.","doc_id":21758,"prior":"measles","SDG3":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19463","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Enhancing resilience in youth : sustainable systemic effects in different environments","authors":"Steinebach, Christoph; Langer, Álvaro I.; Tri Thi, Minh Thuy","subject":" Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"155","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Enhancing resilience in youth : sustainable systemic effects in different environments;  Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie; Nowadays, in order to promote psychological well-being and prevent diseases (mental and physical), several interventions have been developed and tested in school settings.

Nevertheless, despite promising results attesting to the effectiveness of mindfulness in increasing well-being, there remain some open questions concerning how to implement mindfulness in a systematic way beyond research, incorporating it as a regular practice of the educational system which makes it possible to introduce a culture of resilience. In this chapter, we would like to give insights into the sustainability of psychosocial interventions considering a systemic approach in a variety of environments. To do this, we will revisit the concept of resilience (i.e. definition, resources) and how to enhance it (e.g. positive learning, positive peer culture, positive self-development). In summary, we wish to highlight that, to ensure the sustainability of psychosocial interventions in schools, a multilevel approach should be adopted. Specifically, we propose that a framework based on resilience may give rise to a pivotal concept through multiple novel interventions such as mindfulness and compassion, which should be integrated in more systemic and ecological view.","doc_id":21764,"prior":"psychological well-being","SDG3":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2254","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Fast single-use VLP vaccine productions based on insect cells and the baculovirus expression vector system : influenza as case study","authors":"Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Steiger, Nina; Wellnitz, Sabine; Vicente, Tiago; John, Corinne; Eibl, Dieter","subject":"DSP; Influenza; VLP vaccine; Sf-9/BEVS USP; Wave-mixed bioreactor;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"615","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Fast single-use VLP vaccine productions based on insect cells and the baculovirus expression vector system : influenza as case study; DSP; Influenza; VLP vaccine; Sf-/BEVS USP; Wave-mixed bioreactor;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; During the last few years virus like particles (VLPs) have become increasingly interesting for the production of vaccines.

Dabigatran is a new oral anticoagulant that does not require INR monitoring. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in Switzerland.Methods: A Markov model simulating the course of treatment and occurrence of clinical events in two treatment arms over the lifetime of patients was adapted to the Swiss context. The adaptation included the cost of anticoagulation therapy and clinical events in Switzerland. The cost of inpatient care was estimated on data of all inpatient hospital stays in . The calculation of outpatient care costs was based on peer reviewed studies, expert interviews and local tariffs.Results: Patients treated with dabigatran had a higher life expectancy and experienced more quality adjusted life years (QALY) while incurring higher costs than patients treated with vitamin K antagonists. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was CHF ,.‒ per QALY with  mg and CHF , per QALY with  mg of dabigatran. A sequential dosage scheme, in which  mg are administered up to the age of  years and  mg thereafter, resulted in an ICER of CHF , per QALY. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that these results are robust.Conclusions: Dabigatran can be considered cost-effective in comparison with vitamin K antagonists in the Swiss context. The higher drug cost of dabigatran is compensated by savings in INR monitoring, lower cost of clinical events and QALY-gains.","doc_id":21839,"prior":"life expectancy","SDG3":1},{"id":"12","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20447","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"ADELE+ : der Medienumgang von Kindern im Vorschulalter (4-6 Jahre) - Chancen und Risiken für die Gesundheit","authors":"Bernath, Jael; Waller, Gregor; Meidert, Ursula","subject":"Vorschulkinder; Mediennutzung; Psychische Gesundheit; Körperliche Gesundheit; Entwicklung;  Soziale Interaktion;  Soziale Gruppen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"302, 305","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"ADELE+ : der Medienumgang von Kindern im Vorschulalter (- Jahre) - Chancen und Risiken für die Gesundheit; Vorschulkinder; Mediennutzung; Psychische Gesundheit; Körperliche Gesundheit; Entwicklung;  Soziale Interaktion;  Soziale Gruppen; Der Bericht wurde im Rahmen des Nationalen Gesundheitsberichts  «Gesundheit in der Schweiz – Kinder, Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene» erstellt.; Kinder im Vorschulalter kommen immer häufiger mit den unterschiedlichsten digitalen Medien in Kontakt.

Active Advisors help to overcome the shortage of most service and product platforms, i.e. lack of personalization and interaction, and a t the same time offer a face-to-face (ff) experience in the consumer-organization interactions.","doc_id":21942,"prior":"Gesundheit","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15668","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"E-accessibility supports researchers with disabilities","authors":"Darvishy, Alireza","subject":" Informatik;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004, 362","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"E-accessibility supports researchers with disabilities;  Informatik;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; This paper introduces different barriers encountered by researchers and lecturers with disabilities or chronic health conditions (RWDs) in academia, as well as requirements for an inclusive ICT environment in order to overcome these barriers (work in progress).

So erfahren sie eine höhere Mütter- und Säuglingssterblichkeit und sind häufiger von ante- und postpartaler Depression betroffen, in der Schweiz und anderen europäischen Ländern. Forschung zu den Ursachen für diese schlechteren Outcomes weisen auf mannigfaltige Faktoren hin, wie Zugangsbarrieren in Form von Sprachbarrieren, mangelnder Versicherung und weniger Vertrautheit mit dem Gesundheitssystem im Aufnahmeland, sowie Barrieren bei der Nutzung der Gesundheitsangebote, beispielsweise Erfahrungen von Diskriminierung und mangelnder interkultureller Sensitivität seitens der Gesundheitsfachpersonen. Eine wichtige Grenze dieser Studien ist, dass sie mehrheitlich die Perspektive der Gesundheitsfachpersonen beforschen, während Patienten und Patientinnen mit Migrationserfahrung seltener befragt werden.In unserem Projekt, Digitale Gesundheit für Eltern mit Migrationserfahrung, möchten wir uns aufs Thema der Kenntnisse zur Schwangerschaftsvorsorge im schweizerischen Gesundheitssystem fokussieren.

Davon sind jedoch nur wenige speziell auf Migranten zugeschnitten und viele setzen eine sehr gute Beherrschung einer Landessprache für die Benutzung voraus. Die Mehrheit der entwickelten digitalen Mittel waren der Verbesserung der mentalen Gesundheit während Schwangerschaft und Postpartum gewidmet, oder der Erhöhung der Teilnahme an Vorsorgeuntersuchungen, sowie der Verbesserung der Kommunikation und zuletzt der Stillförderung.Somit fanden wir, dass es wenige digitale Tools gibt, die auf Migranten und Migrantinnen zugeschnitten sind, während Schwangerschaft und Postpartum, und dass von den existierenden Tools, nur ganz wenige sich auf die Vermittlung der Kenntnisse zum Ablauf der Schwangerschaftsvorsorge, in den jeweiligen Ländern fokussieren.","doc_id":22015,"prior":"Säuglingssterblichkeit","SDG3":1},{"id":"57","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8669","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Nachhaltige Zusammenarbeit zwischen Forschung und Berufspraxis am Beispiel des SNF-Projekts zur Entwicklung von Qualitätsindikatoren der ambulanten Pflege (Spitex)","authors":"Schaffert, René; Mylaeus, Maja","subject":"Spitex; Qualitätsindikator; Zusammenarbeit Forschung Praxis;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"000, 362","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Nachhaltige Zusammenarbeit zwischen Forschung und Berufspraxis am Beispiel des SNF-Projekts zur Entwicklung von Qualitätsindikatoren der ambulanten Pflege (Spitex); Spitex; Qualitätsindikator; Zusammenarbeit Forschung Praxis;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Hintergrund: Eine enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen Fachhochschulen und Praxispartnern ist Bedingung für eine Unterstützung im Rahmen des DORE Programms (DoREsearch) des Schweizerischen Nationalfonds.

Online interventions offer a number of potential benefits for the treatment of behavioural addictions including easy access, anonymity, and low cost. This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of online interventions for behavioural addictions.Method: Systematic searches were conducted on three electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsychInfo). Studies were included if the online intervention was the main intervention component, and if they reported quantitative data on the effectiveness of the interventions. The study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.Results: A total of  studies were included in this review.  of the studies found the interventions to be effective, which was illustrated by significant reductions in behaviour-related problems as result of the intervention. Overall, acceptability and satisfaction were high, however engagement was low.Conclusions: Online interventions for behavioural addictions are somewhat effective in reducing behaviour-related problems. Results highlight the paucity of well-designed studies and the need of primary prevention. Moreover, further research on behavioural addictions is needed to establish clear diagnostic criteria, to avoid over-pathologizing daily lifestyle choices.","doc_id":22196,"prior":"Krankheiten","posterior":"access","SDG3":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8500","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Psychometric limitations of the 13-item Sense of Coherence Scale assessed by Rasch analysis","authors":"Lerdal, Anners; Opheim, Randi; Gay, Caryl L.; Moum, Bjørn; Fagermoen, May Solveig; Kottorp, Anders Börje Mauritz","subject":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Psychometrics; Rasch analysis; Reliability; Sense of coherence; Validity; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Human; Male; Middle aged; Norway; Quality of life; Reproducibility of result; Surveys and questionnaire; Young adult; Personality Test;  Psychologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"150","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Psychometric limitations of the -item Sense of Coherence Scale assessed by Rasch analysis; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Psychometrics; Rasch analysis; Reliability; Sense of coherence; Validity; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Human; Male; Middle aged; Norway; Quality of life; Reproducibility of result; Surveys and questionnaire; Young adult; Personality Test;  Psychologie; A person's sense of coherence (SOC) reflects their perception that the world is meaningful and predictable, and impacts their ability to deal with stressors in a health-promoting manner.

Improved methods for the direct measurement of heat production as the signature function of brown adipocytes (BAs), particularly at the single cell level, would be of substantial benefit to these ongoing efforts. Here, we report the first application of a small molecule-type thermosensitive fluorescent dye, ERthermAC, to monitor thermogenesis in BAs derived from murine brown fat precursors and in human brown fat cells differentiated from human neck brown preadipocytes. ERthermAC accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum of BAs and displayed a marked change in fluorescence intensity in response to adrenergic stimulation of cells, which corresponded to temperature change. ERthermAC fluorescence intensity profiles were congruent with mitochondrial depolarisation events visualised by the JC- probe.

Two reviewers independently assessed  studies for eligibility, extracted data, and performed quality assessment using predefined forms.

Global interconnectedness and an ever-increasing pace of new technological advances have many leaders blindly navigating in a highly competitive world. Companies are facing new challenges, which often cannot be solved with traditional leadership styles anymore. These harsh circumstances subsequently also influence the workforce. A toxic working environment, psychological complaints and tensions are just some stressors that might enforce unethical behavior. Additionally, rising suicide rates in the Western World imply a loss of norms and values and indicate a vacuum that searches for new answers within the conscious mind. In accordance, new approaches such as mindfulness and sustainable leadership are more and more recognized among current leaders and policy makers. One of which is Theory U by Otto Scharmer.  The aim of this thesis is to evaluate how Theory U impacts leadership behavior, with regards to the triple corporate responsibility model and deep ethics. Since Theory U is a change management method the emphasis, in this instance lays on the intrinsic motivation to become an ethical leader, rather than solely being compliant with corporate standards and ethical guidelines. Theory U has become a preferred tool for many around the world and provides guidance in reaching a more spiritual approach on leadership.

Critical differences (reliable change index) and cut-off points between functional and dysfunctional populations were calculated using the Jacobson and Truax method of calculating clinical significance. Overall, the results indicated that the BSI was more accurate than the OQ- in correctly classifying patients as clinical subjects. Nonetheless, even with the BSI, about % of inpatients with schizophrenia attained a score at admission below the clinical cut-off. Both questionnaires exhibited the highest sensitivity to psychopathology with patients with personality disorders. When considering the differences in the pre-scores, both questionnaires showed the same sensitivity to change. The advantage of using these self-report measures is observed primarily in assessing outpatient psychotherapy outcome.

Frauen und Paare, welche sich trotz der schwerwiegenden Diagnose für das Austragen der Schwangerschaft entscheiden, erleben Höhen und Tiefen während der Schwangerschaftsbetreuung. Mittels dieser Arbeit werden Bedürfnisse der Frauen und Paare, welche ein Kind mit Trisomie  erwarten, aufgezeigt und mit den Aufgabengebieten der Hebamme in Verbindung gebracht. Dazu wird das Krankheitsbild der Trisomie  genauer erläutert und die verschiedenen pränatalen Diagnostikverfahren aufgezeigt. Weiter werden aus Erfahrungsberichten die Bedürfnisse der Paare beleuchtet, welche ein Kind mit Trisomie  erwarten. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf den Erwartungen an das Gesundheitsfachpersonal. Weitere Forschung ist nötig, um die Bedürfnisse der Frauen und Paare zu untersuchen und das Gesundheitspersonal auf diese seltenen Fälle der Trisomie  zu sensibilisieren.","doc_id":22782,"prior":"Lebenserwartung","SDG3":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2857","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Targeted fluoro positioning for the discovery of a potent and highly selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor","authors":"Fischer, Thomas; Riedl, Rainer","subject":"Medicinal chemistry; Drug discovery; Drug design;  Biochemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 615","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Targeted fluoro positioning for the discovery of a potent and highly selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; Medicinal chemistry; Drug discovery; Drug design;  Biochemie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; The incorporation of fluorine atoms into functional molecules is of wide interest in synthetic organic chemistry as well as cognate disciplines.

To enter target cells, morbilliviruses rely on an envelope-anchored machinery, which is composed of two interacting glycoproteins: a tetrameric receptor binding (H) protein and a trimeric fusion (F) protein. To execute membrane fusion, the F protein initially adopts a metastable, prefusion state that refolds into a highly stable postfusion conformation as the result of a finely coordinated activation process mediated by the H protein. Here, we employed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle reconstruction to elucidate the structure of the prefusion state of the CDV F protein ectodomain (solF) at . Å resolution. Stabilization of the prefusion solF trimer was achieved by fusing the GCNt trimerization sequence at the C-terminal protein region, and expressing and purifying the recombinant protein in the presence of a morbilliviral fusion inhibitor class compound. The three-dimensional cryo-EM map of prefusion CDV solF in complex with the inhibitor clearly shows density for the ligand at the protein binding site suggesting common mechanisms of membrane fusion activation and inhibition employed by different morbillivirus members.","doc_id":22839,"prior":"measles","SDG3":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12076","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Measuring the perceived morphological complexity of intracranial aneurysms","authors":"Juchler, Norman; Schilling, Sabine; Bijlenga, Philippe; Kurtcuoglu, Vartan; Hirsch, Sven","subject":"Morphology; Intracranial aneurysms;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"616","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Measuring the perceived morphological complexity of intracranial aneurysms; Morphology; Intracranial aneurysms;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; The rupture of intracranial aneurysms is a potentially deadly event.

In children these tests are associated with higher rates of false-negative and indeterminate results. Age is presumed to be one factor influencing cytokine release and therefore test performance.The aim of this study was to systematically review factors associated with indeterminate IGRA results in pediatric patients.Methods: Systematic literature review guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Studies reporting results of at least one commercially available IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB, T-SPOT.TB) in pediatric patient groups were included. Random effects meta-analysis was used to assess proportions of indeterminate IGRA results. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I value. Risk differences were calculated for studies comparing QuantiFERON-TB and T-SPOT.TB in the same study.Meta-regression was used to further explore the influence of study level variables on heterogeneity.Results: Of , articles screened,  studies were included in the final analysis. These assessed QuantiFERON-TB only in .% (/), QuantiFERON-TB and T-SPOT.TB in .% (/), and T-SPOT.TB only in .% (/) resulting in  datasets including , participants. Overall % of IGRA results were indeterminate, and T-SPOT.TB (., % CI .-.) and QuantiFERON-TB assays (., % CI .-.) showed similar proportions of indeterminate results; pooled risk difference was – . (% CI .-.). Significant differences with lower proportions of indeterminate assays with T-SPOT.TB compared to QuantiFERON-TB were only seen in subgroup analyses of studies performed in Africa and in non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients. Meta-regression confirmed lower proportions of indeterminate results for T-SPOT.TB compared to QuantiFERON-TB only among studies that reported results from non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients (p < .).Conclusion: On average indeterminate IGRA results occur in  in  tests performed. Overall, there was no difference in the proportion of indeterminate results between both commercial assays. However, our findings suggest that in patients in Africa and/or patients with immunocompromising conditions other than HIV infection the T-SPOT.TB assay appears to produce fewer indeterminate results.","doc_id":22975,"prior":"tuberculosis","SDG3":1},{"id":"3","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23291","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Caregiver coaching in early intervention - the example of COPCA","authors":"Akhbari Ziegler, Schirin","subject":" Physiotherapie;  Pädiatrie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"615.82, 618.92","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Caregiver coaching in early intervention - the example of COPCA;  Physiotherapie;  Pädiatrie; ‘COPing with and CAring for infants with special needs’ (COPCA) is a family-centred early intervention programme., The major intervention strategy of COPCA is caregiver coaching.

Caregiver coaching was associated with an increased motor repertoire of the infant and with better family empowerment and quality of life. Caregivers highly appreciate the support from coaches, because coaching enables them to autonomously promote their infant’s development by stimulating the infant to explore and try out activities during daily routines. The lecture provides explanations of potentially underlying mechanisms of the effectiveness of COPCA’s coaching.The COVID-pandemic confronted us with the need of remote intervention and tele-guidance of families. It increased awareness on the importance of including family members as active and equal partners in the intervention process. Coaching of family members, with the aim of empowering the family to support their child’s development in the home environment, turned out to be an essential intervention strategy in Covid times and in countries with limited access to early intervention services due to lack of health professionals or professionals being only available at large geographical distance.

Nutritional labeling has been proposed to encourage healthier menu choices, but there is still no consensus on how it should be implemented. Calorie labeling is now mandatory in the USA for chain restaurants with  or more locations, and has stimulated interest in Europe, particularly among international caterers. A recent Swiss study at a campus gastronomy restaurant showed that calorie-labeling led to selection of menus with significantly lower energy contents. Indeed further research is needed. The present preliminary study aimed to test calorie-labeling in a university cafeteria. Lunch menus were labelled for three days using a traffic light system, with green, yellow or red corresponding to increasing energy contents. After menu selection, customers completed questionnaires and their reactions were also recorded. The experiment will be repeated and compared with a more complex labeling system recently developed at ZHAW.In the first testing, a total of  students, lecturers and researchers from the university participated. Answers showed % of customers took notice of, and % found the traffic-light system to be helpful. However, only % of customers considered the nutritional data in their menu selection, suggesting a low influence on customers. Further study is required to determine the reasons. Simple adjustments to the labeling system, such as additional nutritional information, might lead to higher influence on customers towards the targeted outcome, i.e. selection of lower calorie menus. Nonetheless, the traffic light system appears to be a good starting point. Further studies should include stricter control of experimental errors associated with food catering, e.g. data collection, menu preparation, portion size and others.","doc_id":23028,"prior":"obesity","SDG3":1},{"id":"87","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7548","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A novel microplate 3D bioprinting platform for the engineering of muscle and tendon tissues","authors":"Laternser, Sandra; Keller, Hansjoerg; Leupin, Olivier; Rausch, Martin; Graf-Hausner, Ursula; Rimann, Markus","subject":"3D bioprinting; 3D cell culture; Bioink; Drug development; Muscle tissue engineering;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"A novel microplate D bioprinting platform for the engineering of muscle and tendon tissues; D bioprinting; D cell culture; Bioink; Drug development; Muscle tissue engineering;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Two-dimensional (D) cell cultures do not reflect the in vivo situation, and thus it is important to develop predictive three-dimensional (D) in vitro models with enhanced reliability and robustness for drug screening applications.

In this study, we describe a novel drug screening platform with automated production of D musculoskeletal-tendon-like tissues. With D bioprinting, alternating layers of photo-polymerized gelatin-methacryloyl-based bioink and cell suspension tissue models were produced in a dumbbell shape onto novel postholder cell culture inserts in -well plates. Monocultures of human primary skeletal muscle cells and rat tenocytes were printed around and between the posts. The cells showed high viability in culture and good tissue differentiation, based on marker gene and protein expressions.

Berücksichtigt wurden öffentlich zugängliche Webtexte von Akteuren aus Politik, Medien, Industrie und Wissenschaft. Wiederkehrende Muster der Verständigung im öffentlichen Diskurs bilden die sprachliche Form des \"common sense\" zu einem Thema, der eine wichtige Bezugsgrösse für Kommunikations- und Sprachstrategien ist. Die Analyse erfolgte zunächst explorativ, um die \"kommunikative Infrastruktur\" des Diskursbereichs identifizieren zu können, wie sie sich seit  präsentiert. Im Zentrum der anschliessenden quantitativen und qualitativen Analyse stand ein Korpus mit . Mio. Texten bzw.  Mio. Wörtern von  Webquellen jener Organisationen, die für den StAR-Diskurs zusammen mit dem Auftraggeber als relevant eingestuft worden sind.Die Analyse zeichnet das Bild eines behördenspezifischen, vielschichtigen, aber schwach ausgeprägten Diskurses über Antibiotikaresistenzen, der als ein Spezialthema neben anderen Top-Themen unter den untersuchten Akteuren betrachtet werden kann (wie beispielsweise das allgemeine Thema \"Krankheiten/Behandlungen\"). Die journalistische Berichterstattung zu Antibiotika(resistenzen) ist deutlich bezogen auf Ereignisse und behördliche Informationsangebote.Einzelne Akteure werden im Diskurs sehr unterschiedlich genannt (zitiert, referenziert, erwähnt usw.) Zu den \"Stars\" zählen häufig genannte Akteure wie der Bundesrat, das BAG und weitere Bundesämter, die internationale World Health Organization (WHO), Swissmedic oder die Universität Zürich. Als \"Repräsentanten\" gelten Akteure, die häufig auf andere Akteure verweisen, wie bspw. die Basellandschaftliche Zeitung oder  Minuten. Santésuisse, SVP und die Unispitäler Basel und Zürich zählen als sogenannte \"Relais\" zu jenen Akteuren, die sowohl häufig genannt werden also auch andere Akteure häufig nennen. Der Diskurs erzählt zu vom BAG ausgewählten, wichtigen Such- und Schlüsselwörtern (wie „Antibiotika/-resistenzen“, „Forschung“, „Patienten“, „Wirkungen“ u. a.) differenzierte Geschichten, dies bspw. über die Bedeutung der Patientenverantwortung, über unterschiedliche Wirkungen und die Entwicklung (alternativer) Diagnose-, Behandlungs- und Therapieverfahren sowie die Relevanz, Forschende entsprechend zu fordern, vernetzen und motivieren.Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein deutlich fachsprachlich gekennzeichneter \"Spezialdiskurs\" über Antibiotika(resistenzen) stattfindet, der künftig stärker und gezielter in übergreifende thematische Felder (wie Krankheiten, Umwelt usw.) eingebettet werden sollte und könnte, um Kommunikationsziele von StAR zu erreichen. Dabei wäre auf die Entwicklung eines dafür geeigneten, bürgerfreundlichen Vokabulars zu achten. Während im Diskurs \"Kontroversen\" über Antibiotika/Antibiotikaresistenzen geführt werden, fehlt eine breite \"Diskurskoalition\", die sich auf ein allgemein verständliches Symbol für das Grundanliegen von StAR beziehen könnte. Der bisher dafür gewählte Begriff \"One Health\" hat sich nicht durchsetzen können. Die Ergebnisse der Diskursanalyse sind greifbar und nutzbar in interaktiven Visualisierungen (so genannten Diskurs-Maps). Auf deren Basis können Chancen und Risiken sowie konkrete Empfehlungen abgeleitet werden für verschiedene Handlungsfelder des strategischen Kommunikationsmanagements.","doc_id":23192,"prior":"Gesundheitspolitik","SDG3":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7201","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Multidisziplinäre Gesundheitspolitik und Gesundheitswissenschaft von morgen","authors":"Abel, Bettina; Schulte, Volker B.; Steinebach, Christoph","subject":"Altenpflege; Palliativmedizin; Palliativpflege; Palliativtherapie; Gesundheitspolitik; Multidisziplinarität; Interdisziplinärität;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"362, 616","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Multidisziplinäre Gesundheitspolitik und Gesundheitswissenschaft von morgen; Altenpflege; Palliativmedizin; Palliativpflege; Palliativtherapie; Gesundheitspolitik; Multidisziplinarität; Interdisziplinärität;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":23195,"prior":"Gesundheitspolitik","SDG3":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15310","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Phytotherapy against cancer : analysis down to the transcriptomic level","authors":"Wagschal, I.; Eggenschwiler, Jenny; Viviani, A.","subject":"Transcriptomic; Phytotherapy; Cancer;  Physiotherapie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"615.82, 616","year":"2007","for_data_analysis":"Phytotherapy against cancer : analysis down to the transcriptomic level; Transcriptomic; Phytotherapy; Cancer;  Physiotherapie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","doc_id":23241,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"91","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11518","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"“Placement Budgets” for supported employment : impact on quality of life in a multicenter randomized controlled trial","authors":"Rössler, Wulf; Kawohl, Wolfram; Nordt, Carlos; Haker, Helene; Rüsch, Nicolas; Hengartner, Michael Pascal","subject":" Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.89","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"“Placement Budgets” for supported employment : impact on quality of life in a multicenter randomized controlled trial;  Psychische Störungen, klinische Psychologie und Psychiatrie; Background: Employment is an important aspect of psychiatric rehabilitation.

In the current practice, management functionalities are provided as infrastructural or third party services. In both cases they are external to the application deployment. We claim that this approach has intrinsic limits, namely that separating management functionalities from the application prevents them from naturally scaling with the application and requires additional management code and human intervention. Moreover, using infrastructure provider services for management functionalities results in vendor lock-in effectively preventing cloud applications to adapt and run on the most effective cloud for the job. In this position paper we propose a novel architecture that enables scalable and resilient self-management of microservices applications on cloud.","doc_id":23285,"prior":"health","posterior":"human","SDG3":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19114","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Psychisch kranke Menschen zu Hause: was braucht es? : eine Beschreibung des Versorgungbedarfs von psychisch kranken Menschen durch die spitalexterne Pflege","authors":"Knüppel Lauener, Susanne; Imhof, Lorenz; Indermaur, Esther; Rieder, Evelyn; Wieber, Frank","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Psychisch kranke Menschen zu Hause: was braucht es? : eine Beschreibung des Versorgungbedarfs von psychisch kranken Menschen durch die spitalexterne Pflege; People with mental illness livening at home: What does it need? : a description of the health care needs of people with several mental health disorders in community health care;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Menschen mit schwerwiegenden psychischen Krankheiten haben einen erhöhten Bedarf an psychischer und physischer Gesundheitsversorgung als die Gesamtbevölkerung.

Little is known about the impact of common orthopaedic upper extremity procedures on the quality of life and costs in Switzerland. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the influence of surgery for trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (TMC OA) on the quality of life, direct medical costs and loss of productivity from the societal perspective.Materials and Methods: Patients with TMC OA indicated for surgery were included in a prospective study. Quality of life (EQ-D-L; [index: -]) and hand function (brief Michigan Hand Questionnaire [brief MHQ: -]) were assessed one year before (pre-OP) and up to one year after surgery (post-OP); their relationship was explored by regression analysis. Sixteen major Swiss insurance companies provided direct medical cost data including all health-related diagnoses to consider potential side effects of the surgery. Indirect costs were assessed using the work productivity and activity impairment questionnaire. The year pre-OP served as the control period. Mean total costs to gain one extra quality adjusted life-year (QALY) were estimated by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for all patients.Results: A total of  patients (mean age . years; % female) were included. Patients received a resection-suspension-interposition arthroplasty using either autologous tendons (%) or an allograft (%), a resection arthroplasty only (%), or an implant arthroplasty using a pyrocarbon implant (%). The mean EQ-D index improved from . (pre-OP) to . (post-OP; p < .) and was significantly associated with the brief MHQ (p < .), which improved from  (pre-OP) to  (post-OP; p < .). Annual mean total costs for the first  patients with complete cost data increased from , Swiss Francs (CHF) (pre-OP) to , CHF (post-OP). The ICER was , CHF per QALY gained (%CI: , to , CHF/QALY) one year post-OP compared to the pre-OP control period.Conclusion: TMC OA surgery results in a clinically relevant and statistically significant increase in function and quality of life one year after the intervention. The cost-utility ratio is clearly below the often suggested US$,/QALY threshold.","doc_id":23341,"prior":"health policy","SDG3":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21090","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Inadequate status and low awareness of folate in Switzerland : a call to strengthen public health measures to ensure sufficient intakes","authors":"Herter-Aeberli, Isabelle; Wehrli, Nina; Bärlocher, Kurt; Andersson, Maria; Sych, Janice Marie","subject":"Folate awareness; Folate status; Folic acid; Neural tube defect; Pregnancy; Women;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613.2, 614","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Inadequate status and low awareness of folate in Switzerland : a call to strengthen public health measures to ensure sufficient intakes; Folate awareness; Folate status; Folic acid; Neural tube defect; Pregnancy; Women;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; This publication is connected to the project Folic Acid Awareness in Switzerland.; Background: Folate plays an essential role in the prevention of neural tube defects, yet little is known about the folate status of women of reproductive age or to what degree the general population is aware of the importance of folate in early-life development. We aimed to determine folate status in women of reproductive age and pregnant women in Switzerland, and to assess folate awareness in the Swiss population. Methods: In a convenience sample of  women of reproductive age and  pregnant women throughout Switzerland, we measured red blood cell (RBC) folate concentration. In a second convenience sample (n = , men and women) we assessed folate knowledge with an online survey. Results: RBC folate concentration (median interquartile range) was  (, ) nmol/L in women of reproductive age and  (, ) nmol/L in pregnant women. Folate deficiency (RBC folate < nmol/L) was found in .% of women of reproductive age and .% of pregnant women, while .% of women of reproductive age and .% of pregnant women showed folate concentrations indicating an elevated risk of neural tube defects (RBC folate < nmol/L). The online survey showed that a high proportion (≥%) of participants were aware of folate’s role in neural tube defect (NTD) prevention and fetal development, yet knowledge about dietary sources and national recommendations of folate supplementation when planning pregnancy were limited. Conclusion: The high prevalence of folate inadequacy in Swiss women suggests an elevated risk of neural tube defects and calls for urgent measures to increase folate intakes.","doc_id":23398,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23855","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Media use in the infodemic – is it masked by political ideology?","authors":"Juvalta, Sibylle; Speranza, Camilla; Mehdiyeva, Ramila; Robin, Dominik; Dratva, Julia; Suggs, L.

Reaching young people is especially challenging. Previous research indicates that media information sources as well as political ideology might play an important role in the level of acceptance and adherence to such measures. We address the open question if there is a connection between political ideology, COVID- information behavior, and adherence with containment measures with data from the COVIDisc project. Methods: The COVIDisc project (SNF grant ), investigates how young people, aged - yrs., perceive the communication during the Coronavirus pandemic and what media they use to inform themselves. A random sample drawn by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) (N=,  from Thurgau and Zürich and  from Ticino) was invited to take part in an online survey in November/December . Political ideology was assessed with an -point scale, in which the center corresponded to a neutral position and the numbers left and right of the center corresponded to increasing left or right ideology.Results:  participants were included in the analysis. The mean age is . (sd .), % are from Zurich or Thurgau and % from Ticino, % are female and % were born and raised in Switzerland. .% of respondents placed themselves at the center of the -point political ideology scale and .% at the poles far left/far right (- points from the center). Participants using news sources and official sources placed themselves more to the left on the ideology scale, while persons not using any sources at all placed themselves more to the right. The majority of young people reported to follow the COVID- measures most of the time or always. First regression analyses indicate that the type of media sources used is not significantly associated with adherence to preventive measures, whereas this is the case for positioning far left/far right on the ideology scale when the interaction between far left/far right and trust in government is considered.Conclusions: Political ideology shapes young people's media use and therefore it is important to use diverse channels for COVID- communication. First analyses suggest that positioning far left/far right on the ideology scale is associated with less adherence to preventive measures.","doc_id":23405,"prior":"public health","SDG3":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13377","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Inclination-dependent changes of the critical shoulder angle significantly influence superior glenohumeral joint stability","authors":"Moor, B.K.; Kuster, Roman; Osterhoff, G.; Baumgartner, Daniel; Werner, C.M.L.; Zumstein, M.A.; Bouaicha, S.","subject":"Cadaver; Compressive strength; Humeral head; Joint instability; Anatomic models; Skeletal muscle; Rotator cuff; Shear strength; Shoulder joint; Shoulder pain;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Inclination-dependent changes of the critical shoulder angle significantly influence superior glenohumeral joint stability; Cadaver; Compressive strength; Humeral head; Joint instability; Anatomic models; Skeletal muscle; Rotator cuff; Shear strength; Shoulder joint; Shoulder pain;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Background: The critical shoulder angle combines the acromion index and glenoid inclination and has potential to discriminate between shoulders at risk for rotator cuff tear or osteoarthritis and those that are asymptomatic.

Rasch analysis is a modern psychometric approach that can be used to evaluate these characteristics.Objectives: To evaluate, using Rasch analysis, the psychometric properties of the Lee Fatigue Scale (LFS) in a sample of oncology patients.Methods: The sample comprised  patients (mean age . ± . years, % women) undergoing chemotherapy for breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, or lung cancer. Patients completed the -item LFS within  minutes of awakening (i.e., morning fatigue) and before going to bed (i.e., evening fatigue). Rasch analysis was used to assess validity and reliability.Results: In initial analyses of differential item function, eight of the  items functioned differently depending on whether the LFS was completed in the morning or in the evening. Subsequent analyses were conducted separately for the morning and evening fatigue assessments. Nine of the morning fatigue items and  of the evening fatigue items demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit to the Rasch model. Principal components analyses indicated that both morning and evening assessments demonstrated unidimensionality. Person-separation indices indicated that both morning and evening fatigue scales were able to distinguish four distinct strata of fatigue severity.Conclusion: Excluding four items from the morning fatigue scale and three items from the evening fatigue scale improved the psychometric properties of the LFS for assessing diurnal variations in fatigue severity in oncology patients.","doc_id":23438,"prior":"cancer","SDG3":1},{"id":"69","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22070","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Growth behavior of human adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells in single-use spinner flasks : numerical and experimental investigations","authors":"Jossen, Valentin; Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Kraume, Matthias; Eibl, Dieter","subject":" Biomedizin, Biomedizinische Technik;  Technische Chemie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"610.28, 660","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Growth behavior of human adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells in single-use spinner flasks : numerical and experimental investigations;  Biomedizin, Biomedizinische Technik;  Technische Chemie; Human adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (hASC) represent a valuable source of cells for clinical applications, especially in the field of regenerative medicine. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that interest in hASCs has increased greatly over the last decade. However, in order to use hASCs successfully in clinical applications, in vitro expansion is required. Single-use bioreactors in combination with microcarriers (MC) have been shown to be suitable systems for this task (-). However, hASCs are prone to higher shear sensitivity than conventional cell lines (e.g. CHO, BHK) that are normally expanded in these systems. Hence, the goal of this study was to investigate the influence of different shear stress levels on the growth of hASCs in small scale single-use spinner flasks. For this purpose, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations based on a Euler-Euler and Euler-Lagrange approach were performed to predict the hydrodynamic stresses (. – . Pa), the residence times (. – . s) and the circulation times (. - . s) of the MCs in various high shear zones. The numerical findings were combined with experimental data from cultivation studies (. – .∙ hASC/mL) in order to develop a segregated mathematical growth model for the prediction of MC-associated hASC growth in small scale single-use spinner flasks.","doc_id":23453,"prior":"medicine","posterior":"human","SDG3":1}]
