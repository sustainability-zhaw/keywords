However, evidence on the relationship between social preferences and environmental concerns is mixed, possibly because these constructs have commonly been measured by distinct methods that do not facilitate direct comparisons. We address this gap by introducing an incentivized preference-based measurement approach, extending a subject’s concerns for the well-being of others to a subject’s willingness to support environmental and humanitarian endeavors, based on a simple social preferences utility function. In this measurement approach, subjects make resource allocation choices with real consequences and the design ensures comparability of different revealed preferences (i.e., people’s willingness to make tradeoffs between themselves and others via donations to NGOs supporting different environmental and social causes).We then use this measurement method in an exploratory fashion to consistently assess preferences for environmental and humanitarian concerns in a laboratory experiment. We find that social and environmental value orientations are robustly interrelated, and further that people are generally more willing to pay to benefit people in need, compared to abstract environmental causes. We conclude that interventions to nudge people towards proenvironmental behavior will have a greater impact if human suffering resulting from global climate change is made more salient.","doc_id":65,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"93","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14026","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Bicar : sharing mobility for the last mile","authors":"Dennig, Hans-Jörg; Sauter-Servaes, Thomas; Hoppe, Merja; Burri, Adrian","subject":"Mobility; Sharing; Mobilität;  Kommunikation und Verkehr","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"380","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Bicar : sharing mobility for the last mile; Mobility; Sharing; Mobilität;  Kommunikation und Verkehr; Increasing urbanisation and the threat of climate change call for new strategies for more sustainable urban transportation systems. Bicar represents a unique, pioneering project, created under the leadership of the Centre for Product and Process Development of Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in cooperation with numerous partners and mobility experts. The Bicar mobility concept shows how urban mobility can be realised in an efficient and user-centred way – while also being ecologically friendly and energy efficient. In its functions, degree of comfort, and investment costs, the Bicar is positioned between the conventional universal vehicle, the car, and the good weather option, the (e-)bike. Protected from the weather, and electrically powered, it meets the requirements of typical urban transport, while saving space, and it has been designed from the start for use in a vehicle sharing environment. The ZHAW plans to build a test fleet with the capacity of at least - vehicles as well as the needed infrastructure. The test fleet is to be operated in a town or on a large private company estate in combination with other electric vehicles. Technology providers, researchers, vehicle sharing operators, town planners, investors and mobility enthusiasts are invited to give their support to the Bicar project.","doc_id":181,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5690","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Phenological patterns of flowering across biogeographical regions of Europe","authors":"Templ, Barbara; Templ, Matthias; Filzmoser, Peter; Lehoczky, Annamária; Bakšienè, Eugenija; Fleck, Stefan; Gregow, Hilppa; Hodzic, Sabina; Kalvane, Gunta; Kubin, Eero; Palm, Vello; Romanovskaja, Danuta; Vucˇetic´, Višnja; žust, Ana; Czúcz, Bálint","subject":"Beginning of flowering; Biogeographical regions; Climate change; Europe; Robust regression; Shifting trend; Europe; Flowers; Magnoliopsida; Temperature; Seasons;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Phenological patterns of flowering across biogeographical regions of Europe; Beginning of flowering; Biogeographical regions; Climate change; Europe; Robust regression; Shifting trend; Europe; Flowers; Magnoliopsida; Temperature; Seasons;  Ökologie; Long-term changes of plant phenological phases determined by complex interactions of environmental factors are in the focus of recent climate impact research. There is a lack of studies on the comparison of biogeographical regions in Europe in terms of plant responses to climate. We examined the flowering phenology of plant species to identify the spatio-temporal patterns in their responses to environmental variables over the period -. Data were collected from  countries along a -km-long, North-South transect from northern to eastern Central Europe.Biogeographical regions of Europe were covered from Finland to Macedonia. Robust statistical methods were used to determine the most influential factors driving the changes of the beginning of flowering dates. Significant species-specific advancements in plant flowering onsets within the Continental ( to . days), Alpine ( to . days) and by highest magnitude in the Boreal biogeographical regions (. to . days per decades) were found, while less pronounced responses were detected in the Pannonian and Mediterranean regions. While most of the other studies only use mean temperature in the models, we show that also the distribution of minimum and maximum temperatures are reasonable to consider as explanatory variable. Not just local (e.g. temperature) but large scale (e.g. North Atlantic Oscillation) climate factors, as well as altitude and latitude play significant role in the timing of flowering across biogeographical regions of Europe. Our analysis gave evidences that species show a delay in the timing of flowering with an increase in latitude (between the geographical coordinates of . and .), and an advance with changing climate. The woody species (black locust and small-leaved lime) showed stronger advancements in their timing of flowering than the herbaceous species (dandelion, lily of the valley). In later decades (-), more pronounced phenological change was detected than during the earlier years (-), which indicates the increased influence of human induced higher spring temperatures in the late twentieth century.","doc_id":244,"prior":"climate impact","SDG13":1},{"id":"87","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20517","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Synchrony matters more than species richness in plant community stability at a global scale","authors":"Valencia, Enrique; de Bello, Francesco; Galland, Thomas; Adler, Peter B.; Lepš, Jan; E-Vojtkó, Anna; van Klink, Roel; Carmona, Carlos P.; Danihelka, Jiří; Dengler, Jürgen; Eldridge, David J.; Estiarte, Marc; García-González, Ricardo; Garnier, Eric; Gómez‐García, Daniel; Harrison, Susan P.; Herben, Tomáš; Ibáñez, Ricardo; Jentsch, Anke; Juergens, Norbert; Kertész, Miklós; Klumpp, Katja; Louault, Frédérique; Marrs, Rob H.; Ogaya, Romà; Ónodi, Gábor; Pakeman, Robin J.; Pardo, Iker; Pärtel, Meelis; Peco, Begoña; Peñuelas, Josep; Pywell, Richard F.; Rueda, Marta; Schmidt, Wolfgang; Schmiedel, Ute; Schuetz, Martin; Skálová, Hana; Šmilauer, Petr; Šmilauerová, Marie; Smit, Christian; Song, MingHua; Stock, Martin; Val, James; Vandvik, Vigdis; Ward, David; Wesche, Karsten; Wiser, Susan K.; Woodcock, Ben A.; Young, Truman P.; Yu, Fei-Hai; Zobel, Martin; Götzenberger, Lars","subject":"Climate change driver; Evenness; Species richness; Stability; Synchrony;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Synchrony matters more than species richness in plant community stability at a global scale; Climate change driver; Evenness; Species richness; Stability; Synchrony;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie; The stability of ecological communities is critical for the stable provisioning of ecosystem services, such as food and forage production, carbon sequestration, and soil fertility.

Cr, Ni and Cu could be linked to weathering. This was not the case for Pb. Since organic matter (OM) influences the solid phase speciation of heavy metals, the total organic C and N content, the C and N content of different density fractions of OM and also of the labile (oxidised by HO) and stable (HO-resistant) fractions were determined. Soil OM stocks were high and soils on north-facing slopes had more OM than the south-facing sites to which they were paired. Density measurements and the HO fractionation indicated that the higher OM content on north-facing sites was due to an accumulation of weakly degraded organic material. Due to higher weathering intensity on north-facing sites, the abundance of the EDTA-extractable heavy metals was higher than on south-facing sites. All EDTA-extractable heavy metals showed a good correlation to the water-soluble phenolic concentrations which indicates that the metals were probably translocated as metal-organic complexes. Pb and Cu correlate not only to the light (density <  g/cm) and labile, organic fraction but also to the heavy (density >  g/cm) and stable fraction. High-mountain ecosystems like the Alps are sensitive to changing environmental conditions such as global warming. A warmer climate and the more favourable conditions it brings for biological activity, especially at cooler sites, will probably lead in the short- to mid-term to an increased loss of accumulated, weakly degraded OM. As the Pb and Cu content is significantly related to the labile organic matter pools, the risk exists that an increase in OM mineralisation could affect the storage capacity and mobility of these metals in soils.","doc_id":1027,"prior":"climate","posterior":"warming","SDG13":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9526","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Internationale Klimaschutzverhandlungen und sekundare Nutzen der Klimapolitik","authors":"Pittel, Karen; Rubbelke, Dirk T.G.","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2005","for_data_analysis":"Internationale Klimaschutzverhandlungen und sekundare Nutzen der Klimapolitik;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Analyzing the rationale for climate policy, one utility category is often neglected: secondary benefits.

Automated sharing and pooling options instead of private ownership are broadly discussed because of their possible contributions to climate change mitigation and sustainability. Despite the growing amount of literature on the adoption of these alternatives, little empirical evidence is available on the potential drivers of adoption, such as individuals’ socioeconomic background, mobility characteristics, attitudes, and values. To address this gap, we utilize the results of an online choice experiment involving  participants from Switzerland, which tested future mode choices considering automated cars, automated pooled-use taxis, and automated public transport shuttles, both for short- and long-term mobility decisions. Exploratory regression analysis explains the experiment outcome with a broad set of underlying data predicting willingness to use. Our findings illustrate that automated cars and automated public transport often appeal to the user groups of their traditional non-automated counterparts. However, this does not seem to be the case for automated pooled-use taxis, which we find to be associated with higher-income groups. Attributes on current mobility characteristics and values cannot be significantly associated with automated pooled-use taxis. We also demonstrate that short- and long-term mobility decisions are worth studying together in AV adoption studies.","doc_id":1587,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23427","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Changes in biodiversity and species composition of temperate beech forests in Switzerland over 26 years","authors":"Staubli, Eline; Dengler, Jürgen; Billeter, Regula; Wohlgemuth, Thomas","subject":"Beech forest; Switzerland; Biodiversity; Canopy closure; Climate change; Drought; Ecological indicator value; Resurvey; Permanent plot; Vegetation change;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 580","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Changes in biodiversity and species composition of temperate beech forests in Switzerland over  years; Beech forest; Switzerland; Biodiversity; Canopy closure; Climate change; Drought; Ecological indicator value; Resurvey; Permanent plot; Vegetation change;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Ongoing climate warming affects vegetation in multiple ways, although it is difficult to distinguish its influence from other drivers of vegetation change. We studied how forest vegetation in the Albiskette (canton of Zurich, Switzerland), mainly dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica), changed from  to , while the mean temperature rose by . °C. To investigate how species richness and vegetation composition had changed during these  years, we resampled  permanently marked nested-plot series ( m²,  m² and  m²). Using paired t-tests, we analysed changes in biodiversity metrics and mean ecological indicator values and related the quantified changes to poten-tial explanatory variables via linear regressions. Using the z-values from the power law species-area relationships, we analysed potential changes in beta diversity. Both species richness and herb layer cover significantly decreased from  to  across the three grain sizes. The z-values for the transi-tion from  m² to  m² were significantly higher in . The mean light value in the -m plots in  was also significantly lower than in . Species richness, Shannon diversity and Shannon evenness decreased with increasing tree layer cover. With increasing herb layer cover, species richness increased in the -m plots and the relative species loss decreased in the -m and -m plots. The relationship between species loss and increased canopy cover confirmed that light availability acts as an important driver for species richness. Whether the loss in both herb cover and species is also related to recent summer drought events such as  can only be clarified through further resurveys. Decreases in z-values indicate lower beta diversity and more homogenous vegetation in . The decrease in species richness was more pronounced in the -m plots than in the smaller plots. In some cases, explanatory variables had an effect on the change in species diversity only in the -m² and -m² plots, but not in the -m² plots, indicating that other drivers prevail. The change in species diversity and the influencing factors were clearly scale dependent. Further investigation is required to determine whether our findings are merely region-specific or also valid in other biogeographical regions. To ensure that further species loss does not go unnoticed, we recommend the continuation of coordinated resurvey studies and monitoring.","doc_id":1594,"prior":"climate","posterior":"warming","SDG13":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19579","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Konzept eines Agroforstsystems auf der Parzelle Schünenacher des Birchhofs","authors":"Fröhli, Marc; Fischbacher, Philipp","subject":"Agrarpolitik; Agroforst; Gemüse; Obst; Indirekter Pflanzenschutz; Agrarökologie; Biodiversität; Produktion; Bodenschutz; Nachhaltig;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Produktion","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333.7, 338","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Konzept eines Agroforstsystems auf der Parzelle Schünenacher des Birchhofs; Agrarpolitik; Agroforst; Gemüse; Obst; Indirekter Pflanzenschutz; Agrarökologie; Biodiversität; Produktion; Bodenschutz; Nachhaltig;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Produktion; Die vorliegende Arbeit hatte zum Ziel, den bereits bestehenden Entwurf für ein Agroforstsystem auf der Parzelle «Schünenacher» auf dem Birchhof in Oberwil-Lieli genauer zu untersuchen.

The basic requirements relate to not feeding food to livestock and treating animals respectfully, increasing the variety of plant crops, producing according to the principles of organic farming, and providing nature with more space. As a result, promotional pictures of agriculture become a reality. Soil-independent industrial animal husbandry disappears, all animals have access to pastures, and dual-use cattle breeds are only fed with fodder from meadows and pastures. Annual milk production drops from  to  kg per head but remains the main branch of agricultural activity, while beef becomes a by-product of dairy. Annual meat production decreases from  kg to  kg per head. A total of  kilocalories can still be generated per head and per day,  percent of which comes from plant-based foods. Since arable land is very scarce in Switzerland, with an average of . ares per head compared to . ares per head in the European Union or . ares in the U.S, any increase in agricultural production is the result of an intensification with considerable environmental costs. This finding contradicts the widespread belief that ‘our country is best’. The study concludes that food should be produced where the resources are. This result does not mean that more meat should be imported. Rather, the solution is to reduce meat consumption to an ecologically sustainable and arguably healthier level.","doc_id":1679,"prior":"Klimapolitik","SDG13":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19355","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Nachhaltige Strategieentwicklung und Entscheidungsfindung in nicht-profitorientierten Organisationen : am Beispiel von Aiducation International","authors":"Spälti, Alexandra","subject":" Gemeinnützige Organisationen (NPO);  Unternehmensentwicklung","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"361.763, 658.401","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Nachhaltige Strategieentwicklung und Entscheidungsfindung in nicht-profitorientierten Organisationen : am Beispiel von Aiducation International;  Gemeinnützige Organisationen (NPO);  Unternehmensentwicklung; Der öffentliche Druck auf privatwirtschaftliche Unternehmen nachhaltig zu operieren und sich der sozialen und der ökologischen Verantwortung zu stellen, nimmt in Zeiten des Klimawandels immer mehr zu.

Es wird insbesondere erwartet, dass sich Bäume nicht schnell genug anpassen oder migrieren können, um ohne menschliche Hilfe auf den erwarteten Klimawandel zu reagieren. Das Thema wird jedoch kontrovers diskutiert, da die Einführung fremder Arten in ein Ökosystem auch Nachteile mit sich bringen kann. Zum Beispiel die Verdrängung einheimischer Arten, welche insbesondere wenn eine Art invasiv wird auftritt. Die Hybridisierung zwischen fremden und einheimischen Pflanzenarten ist ein wichtiger Faktor bei der Bewertung invasiver Pflanzen und kann eine Bedrohung für die Biodiversität darstellen. Die Rotbuche (Fagus sylvatica) ist einer der wirtschaftlich bedeutendsten Laubbäume Europas und wird voraussichtlich durch den Klimawandel eine starke Veränderung ihres natürlichen Areals erfahren. Daher wurde die nahe verwandte Orientbuche (Fagus orientalis) als Alternative für die Zukunft vorgeschlagen. Dabei ist jedoch zu berücksichtigen, dass diese beiden Arten in ihrer Kontaktzone in Osteuropa bekanntlich hybridisieren.","doc_id":1990,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13980","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Simulations using the CCSM3 comprehensive AOGCM : mechanisms of abrupt climate change and natural variability during the last centuries","authors":"Renold, Manuel","subject":" Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Dissertation","bid":"551","year":"2007","for_data_analysis":"Simulations using the CCSM comprehensive AOGCM : mechanisms of abrupt climate change and natural variability during the last centuries;  Geologie und Hydrologie","doc_id":2214,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23915","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Towards climate neutrality through integrated energy planning : a cross country comparison and case study analysis of Positive Energy District concepts between Switzerland and Norway","authors":"Haase, Matthias; Baer, Daniela","subject":"Climate neutrality; Integrated energy planning; Certification; PED; Positive energy district;  Energie;  Facility Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"333.79, 658.2","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Towards climate neutrality through integrated energy planning : a cross country comparison and case study analysis of Positive Energy District concepts between Switzerland and Norway; Climate neutrality; Integrated energy planning; Certification; PED; Positive energy district;  Energie;  Facility Management; Reaching for the Global Sustainability Goals, cities play a prominent role as from a geographical view they are identified as the main area for global emissions.

I focus on creative cultural and digital initiatives that have emerged within the last - years in an autonomous region of the Russian Federation: the Republic of Tatarstan. These initiatives were launched by young grassroots activists and entrepreneurs who are Tatars – an ethnic group that predominantly resides in the Republic of Tatarstan. As a republic with a certain degree of autonomy under the Russian federal legislation, Tatarstan has been the centre of the Tatar classic cultural production (theatre, music, arts, and literature), as well as of the Tatar language education. Under the policies of centralization and cultural unification Russia has pursued under the presidency of Vladimir Putin ( onwards), most of the political autonomy arrangements that Tatarstan achieved in the s have been dismantled. The new restrictive ideological climate in Russia has repercussions for activism around ethnocultural questions, such as preservation of minority language and identity. At the same time, dissemination of transnational forms of cultural production and the advancement of digital technologies in Russia contribute to innovative cultural developments in the regions. Adapting these global formats and genres to the local cultural activities, the young members of the Tatar community develop new forms of ethnocultural activism. They produce alternative ways of representing and articulating ethnic identity, which depart sharply from the Soviet-born templates of representing ethnic culture. The urban activities these groups pursue allow for the depoliticization of ethnocultural activism in the conditions of an increasingly restrictive ideological and political climate in which minority activism is often equated with separatism.","doc_id":2612,"prior":"climate","posterior":"production","SDG13":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23072","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Transformative pathways : using integrated assessment models more effectively to open up plausible and desirable low-carbon futures","authors":"Braunreiter, Lukas; van Beek, Lisette; Hajer, Maarten; van Vuuren, Detlef","subject":"Integrated assessment modelling; Scenario; Transformation; Low-carbon future; Science-policy interface; Stakeholder engagement;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Transformative pathways : using integrated assessment models more effectively to open up plausible and desirable low-carbon futures; Integrated assessment modelling; Scenario; Transformation; Low-carbon future; Science-policy interface; Stakeholder engagement;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Integrated assessment models (IAM) and resulting scenarios have become increasingly institutionalised and relevant in the science-policy interface of climate policy. Despite their analytical strengths to conceive low-carbon futures, their co-evolution with the transnational science-policy interface of climate politics has also led to a focus on a specific set of techno-economic futures that are typically based on a relatively narrow set of assumptions. This deviates attention from alternatives that are hardly studied by IAMs, but might be more desirable from a societal perspective. We argue that research-based models and scenarios should support rather than narrow down deliberations on possible and desirable futures and provide an impetus to enact socially desirable change. Accordingly, we propose three future directions regarding the development and use of IAMs: ) incorporate a plurality of perspectives on plausibility and desirability through iterative participatory engagement and worldview-based scenario exploration, ) seek collaboration with the arts and humanities to expand the range of imagined futures beyond the status quo and ) make projected futures more tangible and experiential so that diverse societal actor groups can understand and genuinely engage with them. By deploying the indisputable analytical strengths of IAMs optimally within these suggestions, we believe they can facilitate broader societal debates about transformative pathways to low-carbon futures.","doc_id":2678,"prior":"climate policy","SDG13":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22380","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"The relationship between niche breadth and range size of beech (Fagus) species worldwide","authors":"Cai, Qiong; Welk, Erik; Ji, Chengjun; Fang, Wenjing; Sabatini, Francesco M.; Zhu, Jianxiao; Zhu, Jiangling; Tang, Zhiyao; Attorre, Fabio; Campos, Juan A.; Čarni, Andraž; Chytrý, Milan; Çoban, Süleyman; Dengler, Jürgen; Dolezal, Jiri; Field, Richard; Frink, József P.; Gholizadeh, Hamid; Indreica, Adrian; Jandt, Ute; Karger, Dirk N.; Lenoir, Jonathan; Peet, Robert K.; Pielech, Remigiusz; De Sanctis, Michele; Schrodt, Franziska; Svenning, Jens‐Christian; Tang, Cindy Q.; Tsiripidis, Ioannis; Willner, Wolfgang; Yasuhiro, Kubota; Fang, Jingyun; Bruelheide, Helge","subject":"Climatic niche; Co-occurrence data; Deciduous species; Fagus; Geographical range size; Vegetation-plot data; Niche breadth; Temperate forest flora; Niche evolution; Phylogenetic signal;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"580","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The relationship between niche breadth and range size of beech (Fagus) species worldwide; Climatic niche; Co-occurrence data; Deciduous species; Fagus; Geographical range size; Vegetation-plot data; Niche breadth; Temperate forest flora; Niche evolution; Phylogenetic signal;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Aim: This work explores whether the commonly observed positive range size–niche breadth relationship exists for Fagus, one of the most dominant and widespread broad-leaved deciduous tree genera in temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, we ask whether the  extant Fagus species’ niche breadths and climatic tolerances are under phylogenetic control.Location: Northern Hemisphere temperate forests.Taxon: Fagus L.Methods: Combining the global vegetation database sPlot with Chinese vegetation data, we extracted , relevés containing Fagus species. We estimated biotic and climatic niche breadths per species using plot-based co-occurrence data and a resource-based approach, respectively. We examined the relationships of these estimates with range size and tested for their phylogenetic signal, prior to which a Random Forest (RF) analysis was applied to test which climatic properties are most conserved across the Fagus species.Results: Neither biotic niche breadth nor climatic niche breadth was correlated with range size, and the two niche breadths were incongruent as well. Notably, the widespread North American F. grandifolia had a distinctly smaller biotic niche breadth than the Chinese Fagus species (F. engleriana, F. hayatae, F. longipetiolata and F. lucida) with restricted distributions in isolated mountains. The RF analysis revealed that cold tolerance did not differ among the  species, and thus may represent an ancestral, fixedtrait. In addition, neither biotic nor climatic niche breadths are under phylogenetic control.Main Conclusions: We interpret the lack of a general positive range size–niche breadth relationship within the genus Fagus a s a r esult of t he w idespread d istribution, high among-region variation in available niche space, landscape heterogeneity and Quaternary history. The results hold when estimating niche sizes either by fine-scale co-occurrence data or coarse-scale climate data, suggesting a mechanistic link between factors operating across spatial scales. Besides, there was no evidence for diverging ecological specialization within the genus Fagus.","doc_id":2737,"prior":"climate","posterior":"isolated","SDG13":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19840","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Stream biofilm response to an increasing number of non-flow periods","authors":"Etter, Ariane; Fischer, Selina","subject":"Intermittent waterways; Intermittency; Non-flow period; Artificial streams; Stream biofilm; Frequency; Duration; Impact; Recovery; Autotrophic and heterotrophic activities; Function; Biomass;  Biologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"570","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Stream biofilm response to an increasing number of non-flow periods; Intermittent waterways; Intermittency; Non-flow period; Artificial streams; Stream biofilm; Frequency; Duration; Impact; Recovery; Autotrophic and heterotrophic activities; Function; Biomass;  Biologie; Anthropogenic impacts and climate change are considerably altering freshwater systems. Most significant consequences of this are changes to flow regimes as well as the transformation of permanent into temporary waterways. This is problematic, as despite their role in supporting biodiversity and ecosystem processes, temporary waterways are undervalued and poorly understood. In fact, although the effects of non-flow periods are known, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how changes in frequency and duration of non-flow periods influence temporary waterways. Therefore, the goal of further research is to extend the current knowledge surrounding the effects of temporal components on the aquatic ecosystem. This bachelor thesis aims to identify how the frequency of non-flow periods affects autotrophic and heterotrophic stream biofilm. With this objective, an experiment at the Experimental Stream Facility of Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA) was performed. The treatments consisted of one drought duration ( days) and three frequencies ( period of ,  periods of ,  periods of  non-flow days). The development of the autotrophic and heterotrophic stream biofilm was measured during flow periods by means of yield of photochemistry, aerobic respiration, ecosystem metabolism and ash free dry mass. The hypotheses were that with increasing frequency, the effects on stream biofilm are less because the number of subsequent non-flow days is smaller and thus the biofilm is less stressed, and that autotrophs in the epipsammic biofilm recover more slowly than in the epilithic biofilm, because the amount of water retained in sand is higher. Both hypotheses were partially confirmed, as an increasing frequency only lessened the effect on epipsammic biofilm and only autotrophic function recovered more slowly in sand than on cobbles.

They play an important role in improving the microclimate through transpiration and shading. However, due to the extreme site factors in the street places, many native species can no longer meet our requirements for city trees. Thus, there is a growing need to increase knowledge about the response patterns of urban trees to drought stress as well as their influence on the urban microclimate. The resource availability of the original habitat of a species seems to influence its environmental tolerance. First studies show that foreign species react more sensitively to drought compared to Central European species and limit their transpiration with limited resources. In order to optimize tree sites and thus increase the vitality and ecosystem services of classical tree species, the concept of Sponge City is presented in the theoretical part of this thesis. The present work aims to measure the cooling performance and drought stress tolerance of three tree species at a street site in the city of Zurich, using sap flow measurements at stem level and temperature and humidity measurements at different stem heights. The tree species are Gleditsia triacanthos 'Skyline', Ulmus 'Rebona' and Salix alba 'Liempde'. A total of three trees of each species are examined. Thereby, the statistical analysis does not include measurement results of Ulmus `Rebona` due to vandalism at the study site. The results show that the water loss of the species is closely related to climatic factors. Sap flow increases with increasing temperature, while decreasing temperatures, higher humidity and precipitation reduce the rates. In this regard, Gleditsia triacanthos and Salix alba despite their affiliation to the riparian trees, exhibit species-specific responses to drought and heat. While Gleditsia triacanthos shows a high sensitivity to atmospheric drought and strongly regulates water consumption, Salix alba maintains its stomatal conductance even under drying conditions. Thus, despite a larger transpiring leaf area Gleditsia triacanthos has a lower sap flow rate than Salix alba. The results suggest that Gleditsia triacanthos as a ring-porous species, can be assigned to the stress-avoiding, isohydric strategy type and the willows as diffuse-porous species to the stress-stolant, anisohydric species. A direct cooling effect, which would be due to the transpiration amount, is not yet possible due to the young trees with reduced sap flow and small crowns. Nevertheless, the non-significant temperature differences can be attributed to initial shading effects of the trees as well as the lower surface temperature of the vegetative structures. The ability to limit its own water consumption protects Gleditsia triacanthos from loss of vitality, but results in lower cooling effects. Therefore, Gleditsia triacanthos can be recommended for strongly sun-exposed sites with less water availability. Salix alba will have a high cooling effect as it ages, which may increase the quality of life in dense urban areas. However, this species should be planted in locations with sufficient access to soil moisture, which in addition, are not fully sunlit all day.","doc_id":3070,"prior":"climate","posterior":"extreme","SDG13":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24105","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Stadtbäume für die Zukunft : Beurteilung der Eignung von einheimischen und fremdländischen Baumarten im urbanen Raum und Ermittlung ihrer Kühlleistung sowie ihrer Trockenstressverträglichkeit mithilfe baumphysiologischer Messungen","authors":"Schubert, Lea","subject":"Stadtbäume; Zukunftsfähige Baumarten; Schwammstadt; Kühlungseffekt; Grüne Infrastruktur; Saftfluss-messungen; Klimawandel; Wärmeinseleffekt; Ringporige Gehölze; Zerstreutporige Gehölze; Auen- und Ufergehölze; Lebensbereich; Trockenstressverträglichkeit; Baumphysiologie;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"580","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Stadtbäume für die Zukunft : Beurteilung der Eignung von einheimischen und fremdländischen Baumarten im urbanen Raum und Ermittlung ihrer Kühlleistung sowie ihrer Trockenstressverträglichkeit mithilfe baumphysiologischer Messungen; Stadtbäume; Zukunftsfähige Baumarten; Schwammstadt; Kühlungseffekt; Grüne Infrastruktur; Saftfluss-messungen; Klimawandel; Wärmeinseleffekt; Ringporige Gehölze; Zerstreutporige Gehölze; Auen- und Ufergehölze; Lebensbereich; Trockenstressverträglichkeit; Baumphysiologie;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Im Angesicht des Klimawandels und der globalen Verstädterung, werden Bäume zunehmend zum zentralen Element des Stadtgrüns, um Hitzebelastung zu reduzieren.

Während die Gleditschie eine hohe Sensitivität gegenüber atmosphärischer Trockenheit zeigt und den Wasserverbrauch stark reguliert, hält die Silberweide ihre stomatäre Leitfähigkeit auch unter trockenen Bedingungen aufrecht. So weist die Gleditschie trotz grösserer transpirierender Blattfläche eine geringere Saftflussrate als die Silberweide auf. Die Resultate lassen darauf schliessen, dass die Gleditschie als ringporige Art, dem isohydrischen Strategietyp und die Silberweide als Zerstreutporer den anisohydrischen Spezies zugeordnet werden kann. Ein Kühleffekt, der auf die Transpirationsmenge zurückzuführen wäre, ist aufgrund der jungen Bäume mit kleinen Kronen noch nicht möglich. Die nicht signifikanten Temperaturunterschiede können dennoch auf erste Beschattungseffekte der Bäume sowie geringeren Oberflächentemperatur der vegetativen Strukturen zurückgeführt werden. Die Eigenschaft, den eigenen Wasserverbrauch einschränken zu können, bewahrt die Gleditschie vor Vitalitätseinbussen, resultiert jedoch in geringeren Kühleffekten. Daher kann die Gleditschie für stark sonnenexponierte Standorte mit weniger Wasserverfügbarkeit empfohlen werden. Die Silberweide wird mit zunehmendem Alter einen hohen Kühleffekt aufweisen, was in verdichteten Stadtgebieten die Aufenthaltsqualität steigern kann. Sie sollte jedoch an Standorte mit genügend Zugang zur Bodenfeuchtigkeit gepflanzt werden, die darüber hinaus, nicht ganztägig voll besonnt sind.; In the face of climate change and global urbanization, trees becoming the central element of urban green spaces to reduce heating stress. They play an important role in improving the microclimate through transpiration and shading. However, due to the extreme site factors in the street places, many native species can no longer meet our requirements for city trees. Thus, there is a growing need to increase knowledge about the response patterns of urban trees to drought stress as well as their influence on the urban microclimate. The resource availability of the original habitat of a species seems to influence its environmental tolerance. First studies show that foreign species react more sensitively to drought compared to Central European species and limit their transpiration with limited resources. In order to optimize tree sites and thus increase the vitality and ecosystem services of classical tree species, the concept of Sponge City is presented in the theoretical part of this thesis. The present work aims to measure the cooling performance and drought stress tolerance of three tree species at a street site in the city of Zurich, using sap flow measurements at stem level and temperature and humidity measurements at different stem heights. The tree species are Gleditsia triacanthos 'Skyline', Ulmus 'Rebona' and Salix alba 'Liempde'. A total of three trees of each species are examined. Thereby, the statistical analysis does not include measurement results of Ulmus `Rebona` due to vandalism at the study site. The results show that the water loss of the species is closely related to climatic factors. Sap flow increases with increasing temperature, while decreasing temperatures, higher humidity and precipitation reduce the rates. In this regard, Gleditsia triacanthos and Salix alba despite their affiliation to the riparian trees, exhibit species-specific responses to drought and heat. While Gleditsia triacanthos shows a high sensitivity to atmospheric drought and strongly regulates water consumption, Salix alba maintains its stomatal conductance even under drying conditions. Thus, despite a larger transpiring leaf area Gleditsia triacanthos has a lower sap flow rate than Salix alba. The results suggest that Gleditsia triacanthos as a ring-porous species, can be assigned to the stress-avoiding, isohydric strategy type and the willows as diffuse-porous species to the stress-stolant, anisohydric species. A direct cooling effect, which would be due to the transpiration amount, is not yet possible due to the young trees with reduced sap flow and small crowns. Nevertheless, the non-significant temperature differences can be attributed to initial shading effects of the trees as well as the lower surface temperature of the vegetative structures. The ability to limit its own water consumption protects Gleditsia triacanthos from loss of vitality, but results in lower cooling effects. Therefore, Gleditsia triacanthos can be recommended for strongly sun-exposed sites with less water availability. Salix alba will have a high cooling effect as it ages, which may increase the quality of life in dense urban areas. However, this species should be planted in locations with sufficient access to soil moisture, which in addition, are not fully sunlit all day.","doc_id":3070,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"67","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23941","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"The coffee guide","authors":"Bozzola, Martina; Charles, Sarah; Ferretti, Tommaso; Gerakari, Eleni; Manson, Hernan; Rosser, Neil; von der Goltz, Philip","subject":"Coffee; Supply chain; Sustainability; Coffee market;  Produktion","type":"Buch","bid":"338","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The coffee guide; Coffee; Supply chain; Sustainability; Coffee market;  Produktion; The Coffee Guide is the world's most extensive, hands-on and neutral source of information on the international coffee trade.

In order to tackle those challenges, it is necessary to transform our cities into sustainable systems using a holistic approach. One element in achieving this transition is the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS). NBS can provide a range of ecosystem services beneficial for the urban biosphere such as regulation of micro-climates, flood prevention, water treatment, food provision and more. However, most NBS are implemented serving only one single purpose. Adopting the concept of circular economy by combining different types of services and returning resources to the city, would increase the benefits gained for urban areas. The COST Action Circular City aims to establish a network testing the hypothesis that: ‘A circular flow system that implements NBS for managing nutrients and resources within the urban biosphere will lead to a resilient, sustainable and healthy urban environment’. In this paper we introduce the COST Action Circular City by describing its main objectives and aims. The paper also serves as introduction to the review papers of the Action's five Working Groups in this Special Issue.","doc_id":3454,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14085","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Effects of salt compensation on the climate model response in simulations of large changes of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation","authors":"Stocker, Thomas; Timmermann, Axel; Renold, Manuel; Timm, Oliver","subject":" Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"551","year":"2007","for_data_analysis":"Effects of salt compensation on the climate model response in simulations of large changes of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation;  Geologie und Hydrologie; ©  American Meteorological Society (https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/ethical-guidelines-and-ams-policies/ams-copyright-policy/)","doc_id":3594,"prior":"climate model","SDG13":1},{"id":"89","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7545","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Local adaptation at range edgesv: comparing elevation and latitudinal gradients","authors":"Halbritter, A.

However, the factors that affect adaptation, including gene flow and local selection pressures, are likely to vary across different types of range edge. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to investigate local adaptation in populations of Plantago lanceolata and P. major from central locations in their European range and from their latitudinal and elevation range edges (in northern Scandinavia and Swiss Alps, respectively). We also characterized patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation in populations using molecular markers. Range-centre plants of P. major were adapted to conditions at the range centre, but performed similarly to range-edge plants when grown at the range edges. There was no evidence for local adaptation when comparing central and edge populations of P. lanceolata. However, plants of both species from high elevation were locally adapted when compared with plants from high latitude, although the reverse was not true. This asymmetry was associated with greater genetic diversity and less genetic differentiation over the elevation gradient than over the latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that adaptation in some range-edge populations could increase their performance following climate change. However, responses are likely to differ along elevation and latitudinal gradients, with adaptation more likely at high-elevation. Furthermore, based upon these results, we suggest that gene flow is unlikely to constrain adaptation in range-edge populations of these species.","doc_id":3634,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16910","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Pore condensation and freezing is responsible for ice formation below water saturation for porous particles","authors":"David, Robert O.; Marcolli, Claudia; Fahrni, Jonas; Qiu, Yuqing; Perez Sirkin, Yamila A.; Molinero, Valeria; Mahrt, Fabian; Brühwiler, Dominik; Lohmann, Ulrike; Kanji, Zamin A.","subject":"Cirrus; Cloud; Deposition nucleation; Ice nucleation; Pore condensation and freezing;  Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"551","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Pore condensation and freezing is responsible for ice formation below water saturation for porous particles; Cirrus; Cloud; Deposition nucleation; Ice nucleation; Pore condensation and freezing;  Geologie und Hydrologie; Ice nucleation in the atmosphere influences cloud properties, altering precipitation and the radiative balance, ultimately regulating Earth's climate.

These spe-cies-rich habitats are threatened by intensification or abandonment of agricultural use, eutrophication, climate change and landscape fragmentation. However, different studies in various regions of Central Europe are inconsistent in their findings about degree and direction of changes. We thus resurveyed the historical vegetation plots of the alliance Mesobromionin the Swiss Jura Mts. In , we re-sampled  quasi-permanent vegetation plots originally recorded in  to quantify potential vegetation change. Frequency of individual species, species diversity,  ecological indicator values and four functional traits, as well as the presence of diagnostic species of phytosociological alliances, were analysed. Further, a habitat classification and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were also performed. Species richness, indicator values for light availability and temperature, seed dispersal by animals and seed persistence had significantly decreased by . Conversely, ecological indicator values for nutrient availability and soil moisture as well as community-weighted means for seed mass and canopy height had significantly increased. There were significantly fewer ruderal species, stress-tolerators, therophytes and herbaceous chamaephytes in . In contrast, highly competitive species and hemicryptophytes had increased. Together, these findings indicate an increase in productivity over time. There were fewer specialized species in  than in , indicating a homogenization of the vegetation and a shift towards nutrient-rich pastures and meadows. The shift towards a later succession-al stage might indicate reduced grazing disturbance. Most of these sites are currently not included in an agri-environmental scheme. Partial differences of our findings from those reported elsewhere in Central Europe highlight the importance of regionally adapted conservation strategies in order to stop biodiver-sity loss in meso-xeric grasslands.","doc_id":3665,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"80","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22176","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Design principles for energy autonomous logistics cold chains","authors":"Scherrer, Maike; Rühlin, Viola","subject":"Supply chain design; Logistics; Cold chain;  Produktionssteuerung;  Material- und Versorgungsmanagement","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.5, 658.7","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Design principles for energy autonomous logistics cold chains; Supply chain design; Logistics; Cold chain;  Produktionssteuerung;  Material- und Versorgungsmanagement; The increasing demand for temperature-controlled products (pharmaceuticals / food) leads to increased energy demand in the logistics sector and to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

The investigated parameters include total carbon and nitrogen as well as the stable (resistant to HO oxidation) C and N fractions. Time trends were analysed and are reported on the basis of stocks and concentrations. The accumulation rates of C and N strongly decreased with increasing soil age. Differences in trends between the European Alps and the Wind River Range might be attributed to the factor climate. For the drier Wind River Range, an asymptotic value of about  kg C m−  was reached after about  ky while an asymptotic value of – kg C m−  was measured for the moister European Alps after about  ky. The difference in N stocks between the two regions was less obvious. For both areas, N was in the range of .– kg N m− . Using the exponential decay model, a steady state of C and N (stable and total) concentrations in the topsoil seemed to be reached after <  ky (Alps) and  ky (Wind River Range). The retardation effect observed for the Wind River Range could probably be due to aeolian influx. For both areas, the asymptotic value of the stable fraction of C and N was in the range of – kg C m−  and .–. kg N m− , respectively. The stable organic fraction often has an age close to the age of the soils and consequently can reach thousands of years. The relative proportion of N and amides was higher in the stable organic fraction compared to the bulk soil.The sequestration rates of org. C and N in soils of the European Alps and the Wind River Range can reach very high values in very young soils whereas in old soils sequestration rates are several orders of magnitude lower.

We used a case study in the Swiss Alps (hydropower company Kraftwerke Oberhasli AG) to develop an efficient and successful procedure for the ecological evaluation of such impacts, and to predict the effects of possible mitigation measures. We evaluated the following scenarios using  biotic and abiotic indicators: the pre-mitigation scenario (i.e. current state), the future scenario with increased turbine capacity but without mitigation measures, and future scenarios with increased turbine capacity and four alternative mitigation measures. The evaluation was based on representative hydrographs and quantitative or qualitative prediction of the indicators. Despite uncertainties in the ecological responses and the future operation mode of the hydropower plant, the procedure allowed the most appropriate mitigation measure to be identified. This measure combines a basin and a cavern at a total retention volume of ,m, allowing for substantial dampening in the flow falling and ramping rates and in turn considerable reduction in stranding risk for juvenile trout and in macroinvertebrate drift. In general, this retention volume had the greatest predicted ecological benefit and can also, to some extent, compensate for possible modifications in the hydropower operation regime in the future, e.g. due to climate change, changes in the energy market, and changes in river morphology. Furthermore, it also allows for more specific seasonal regulations of retention volume during ecologically sensitive periods (e.g. fish spawning seasons).

Dieser Ausbau bedingt zwar grosse Investitionen, er schafft aber auch inländische Wertschöpfung und Arbeitsplätze. In der vorliegenden Studie wurde berechnet, wie gross dieses Potential ist. Spezifisch wurde das inländische Wertschöpfungs- und Arbeitsplatzpotential, sowie die Wirtschaftlichkeit des Ausbaus der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz von  bis  in zwei Szenarien untersucht. Das Referenzszenario orientierte sich stark am Szenario ZERO Basis der Energieperspektiven +, während im Ausbauszenario ein zusätzlich beschleunigter Ausbau angenommen wurde, welcher nötig ist, um bis  die Treibhausgasemissionen auf netto null zu senken. Die untersuchten Massnahmen und Technologien beinhalten die Photovoltaik (PV), den Windstrom, die Solarthermie, energetische Gebäudesanierungen, der erneuerbare Heizungsersatz und die Energieeffizienz im Strombereich, wobei für letztere nur die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten berechnet wurden, da ihr inländisches Wertschöpfungs- und Arbeitsplatzpotential als gering eingestuft wurde.Der moderate Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz im Referenzszenario schafft bis  rund . Milliarden Franken inländische Wertschöpfung. Über die gesamte Lebensdauer der verschiedenen Anlagen gesehen, steigt dieser Wert auf . Milliarden Franken, da Technologien, wie PV, Windstrom-Anlagen oder Heizsysteme, auch während ihrem Betrieb Wertschöpfung generieren. Das Wertschöpfungspotential des beschleunigten Ausbaus der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz, hier berechnet im Ausbauszenario, ist um mehr als  Prozent höher. Bis  schaffen zusätzliche energetische Gebäudesanierungen, erneuerbare Heizsysteme und PV-, Windstrom- und solarthermische Anlagen rund . Milliarden Franken inländische Wertschöpfung. Über die gesamte Lebenszeit dieser Anlagen werden sogar . Milliarden Franken an inländischer Wertschöpfung generiert. Der grösste Anteil am Wertschöpfungspotential haben die energetische Gebäudesanierungen und der erneuerbare Heizungsersatz. Ein Grund liegt in der grossen Zahl an Altbauten, welche noch saniert und deren fossilen Heizsysteme ersetzt werden können. Ein weiterer wichtiger Grund besteht darin, dass bei Gebäudesanierungen und beim Ersatz von Heizsystemen viel Arbeit entsteht, welche lokale Wertschöpfung schafft. Schliesslich werden auch ein Grossteil der verwendeten Produkte, wie Dämmstoffe, Fenster und in kleinerer Zahl auch Wärmepumpen, in der Schweiz hergestellt. Bei der Installation von PV- und Windstrom-Anlagen ist der Anteil an ausführenden Arbeiten an den Investitionskosten geringer und die Produkte werden mehrheitlich importiert. Zusätzlich ist beim Windstrom wie auch bei der Solarthermie das Ausbaupotential klein.Das grosse inländische Wertschöpfungspotential des Ausbaus der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz schlägt sich auch in der Anzahl Arbeitsplätze nieder, die so geschaffen werden können. Die Resultate der Berechnungen zeigen, dass bei einem moderaten Aus-bau im Referenzszenario bis im Jahr  rund ' Arbeitsplätze entstehen können. Diese Zahl steigt um rund  Prozent im Ausbauszenario auf rund ' Arbeitsplätze. Auch hier entstehen die meisten Arbeitsplätze bei den energetischen Gebäudesanierungen und dem erneuerbaren Heizungsersatz aus den gleichen Gründen wie bei der inländischen Wertschöpfung. Die Aufteilung der Arbeits-plätze nach Arbeitsschritten zeigt, dass anteilsmässig die Montage der neuen Anlagen inklusive der Gebäudesanierungsarbeiten mit rund  Prozent die meisten Arbeitsplätze ausmachen. Aber auch die Herstellung von Materialien, wie Dämmstoffe, Fenster, Wärmepumpen und solarthermische Module, sowie die Planung solcher Anlagen generieren einen erheblichen Anteil an Arbeitsplätzen mit bis zu  Prozent, respektive  Prozent je nach Szenario. Der Betrieb und der Unterhalt schaffen schliesslich rund  Prozent der Arbeitsplätze. Diese sind jedoch wertvoll, da sie im Gegensatz zu den anderen nicht nur einmal bei der Installation, sondern jährlich auch über  hinaus anfallen. An dieser Stelle ist es wichtig zu erwähnen, dass es sich mit Ausnahme des erneuerbaren Heizungsersatzes um zusätzliche Arbeitsplätze handelt. Das heisst, dass beim Ausbau der PV-, Windstrom- und solarthermischen Kapazitäten sowie den energetischen Gebäudesanierungen keine Arbeitsplätze geschaffen werden, die anderweitig verloren gehen. Letzteres ist jedoch der Fall beim erneuerbaren Heizungsersatz, wo Wärme-pumpen und Holzpelletheizungen anstelle von Öl- und Gasheizungen eingesetzt werden und so Arbeitsplätze im Transport und Vertrieb der fossilen Energieträger und im Service und Unterhalt der Heizsysteme verloren gehen. Diese Verluste sind jedoch kleiner im Vergleich zu den zusätzlichen Arbeitsplätzen, die durch die Herstellung von Wärmepumpen, die Bohrung von Erdsonden und die zusätzliche Strom- und Holzpelletproduktion entstehen.Die Wirtschaftlichkeit der verschiedenen Massnahmen in den beiden Szenarien wurde als direkte volkswirtschaftliche Kosten pro produzierter oder eingesparter Energie im Jahr  berechnet. Die Resultate zeigen ein gemischtes Bild. Ein beschleunigter PV-Ausbau wie im Ausbauszenario modelliert lohnt sich doppelt, da mehr Kapazität zu tieferen volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten zugebaut werden. Die Gründe liegen in den PV-Stromgestehungskosten, welche einerseits im Jahr  tiefer sein werden als für den Schweizer Strommix und andererseits über die Zeit sinken werden, sodass sich der beschleunigte Ausbau mehr und mehr lohnt. Beim Windstrom zeigt sich, dass der moderate Ausbau im Referenzszenario volkswirtschaftlich ein bisschen günstiger ist als der beschleunigte Ausbau. Dies liegt mehrheitlich daran, dass die Windstromgestehungskosten im Jahr  über dem Preis für den Schweizer Strommix liegen werden. Die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten der Solarthermie sind einerseits erheblich höher als für PV. Der Grund liegt in der Annahme, dass solarthermische Anlagen durchschnittlich viel kleiner sind als PV-Anlagen und so nicht von Skaleneffekten profitieren. Der grosse Unterschied zwischen den Szenarien für den solarthermischen Ausbau kommt hauptsächlich daher, dass die Differenz des kleineren Ausbaus im Referenzszenario durch Heizwärme gedeckt werden muss, deren Kosten pro Megawattstunde produzierter Wärme unter denen der Solarthermie liegen. Der erneuerbare Heizungsersatz und die energetischen Gebäudesanierungen beeinflussen sich gegenseitig. Das heisst, dass der Ausbau der einen Massnahme auf die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten der anderen einwirkt. Der beschleunigte Ausbau der erneuerbaren Heizsysteme beim Ersatz ist teurer, wenn gleichzeitig die energetischen Gebäudesanierungen forciert werden. Der Grund liegt in den Kosten, welche sich auf eine kleinere Wärmeproduktion verteilen, da mehr sanierte Gebäude die durchschnittliche Nachfrage nach Raumwärme senken. Ist das nicht der Fall und die Nach-frage nach Raumwärme also in beiden Szenarien gleich hoch, ist der erneuerbare Heizungsersatz im Ausbauszenario volkswirtschaftlich kostengünstiger als im Referenzszenario. Auch der beschleunigte Ausbau der energetischen Gebäudesanierungen ist teurer, wenn gleichzeitig der erneuerbare Heizungsersatz forciert wird. Der Grund liegt in den tiefen Betriebskosten der Wärmepumpen, die bei grösserer Anzahl die durchschnittlichen Heizkosten senken. Wird jedoch auch im Ausbauszenario ein moderater Ausbau des erneuerbaren Heizungsersatzes und deshalb in beiden Szenarien gleich hohe Heizkosten angenommen, verursachen die energetischen Gebäudesanierungen in beiden Szenarien die gleichen volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten.Die Wirtschaftlichkeit von Massnahmen zur Energieeffizienz im Strombereich wurde als Differenz zwischen zwei Szenarien, welche den moderaten und den beschleunigten Ausbau der Stromeffizienz modellierten, berechnet. Die Resultate in der nachfolgenden Grafik zeigen also, wie hoch die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten pro zusätzlich eingesparter Megawattstunde Strom ausfallen. Im Bereich der Beleuchtung können mit einem konsequenten Einsatz von Leuchtdioden (LEDs) über  Franken für jede eingesparte Megawattstunde gespart werden. Kosteneinsparungen gibt es auch im Bereich der industriellen Antriebe, wo stromeffiziente Motoren aus volkswirtschaftlicher Sicht über  Franken pro ein-gesparter Megawattstunde Storm sparen können. Erhöhte Stromeffizienz im Bereich der Kochherde (Prozesswärme) und Haushaltsgrossgeräte (Antriebe) hingegen führt zu volkswirtschaftlichen Mehr-kosten von rund , beziehungsweise  Franken pro eingesparter Megawattstunde Strom. Hier ist jedoch herauszuheben, dass die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten der Kochherde immer noch unter dem angenommenen Strompreis des Schweizer Strommix von . Franken pro Megawattstunde liegen wird. Das heisst, dass eine durch effizientere Kochherde eingesparte Megawattstunde Strom immer noch billiger sein wird als eine zusätzlich produzierte Megawattstunde Strom.Die vorliegende Studie untersucht die inländische Wertschöpfung, die Arbeitsplätze und die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten, welche der beschleunigte Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz in der Schweiz schaffen. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass nur die direkten Effekte untersucht wurden. Indirekte Effekte, wie erhöhte Steuereinnahmen, zusätzliche Wertschöpfung und Arbeitsplätze in der Zulieferindustrie und durch Exporte und die Förderung der Innovation in der Schweizer Industrie wurden nicht berücksichtigt. Auch die gesellschaftlichen Vorteile eines beschleunigten Ausbaus der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz, wie die Senkung der Treibhausgasemissionen und die Förderung der Energiewende, wurden nicht untersucht. Diese sind aber wichtig in einer umfassen-den Beurteilung der einzelnen Massnahmen.Damit die Schweiz ihre Klimaziele erreicht, muss der Ausstoss von Treibhausgasen vollständig eliminiert werden. Der Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz hilft, dieses Ziel zu er-reichen. Die vorliegende Studie zeigt, dass dieser Ausbau gleichzeitig Wertschöpfung und wertvolle Arbeitsplätze im Inland schafft. Ohne die richtigen politischen Rahmenbedingungen werden jedoch keine zusätzlichen Anstrengungen im Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien und der Energieeffizienz passieren. Es liegt also an den politischen Entscheidungsträgern, die Weichen so zu stellen, dass nicht nur das Klima, sondern auch die Schweizer Wirtschaft von der Energiewende profitieren kann.","doc_id":5018,"prior":"Klima","posterior":"Rahmenbedingungen","SDG13":1},{"id":"81","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5720","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"CONSUS : ein neues Tool für die Agrarplanung","authors":"Jaisli, Isabel; Stauffacher, Sabine","subject":"Food Value Chain; Tool; Beschaffung; Nachhaltigkeit;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Geografie und Reisen","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"333, 910","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"CONSUS : ein neues Tool für die Agrarplanung; Food Value Chain; Tool; Beschaffung; Nachhaltigkeit;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Geografie und Reisen; Globalisierung, Klimawandel, Ressourcenknappheit und neue Ernährungsgewohnheiten zwingen Produzenten und Unternehmen im Agrarmarkt zu neuen Strategien.

Der nachfolgende Beitrag fasst die Ergebnisse einer Studie zum Bergtourismus zusammen, die  zunächst von der Universität für Bodenkultur Wien für den österreichischen Alpenraum begonnen wurde und dann durch Zusammenarbeit mit der Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften und dem Schweizer Alpenclub auch auf die Schweiz ausgedehnt werden konnte.Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, dass ein hoher Prozentsatz der Bergbesucher (mehr als die Hälfte der Befragten) im Hinblick auf alpine Gefahren sehr unsicher ist. Eine Zunahme deutlich erkennbarer alpiner Gefahren führen bei dieser erholungsorientierten Zielgruppe sehr rasch zu Abwanderungen. Dies ist umso mehr zu beachten, als es sich überwiegend um regelmäßige Besucher der Bergwelt handelt und viele davon zur regionalen Wertschöpfung durch Übernachtung beitragen.","doc_id":5176,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"44","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22383","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"The influence of ozone feedbacks on surface climate following spring arctic ozone depletion","authors":"Friedel, Marina; Chiodo, Gabriel; Stenke, Andrea; Domeisen, Daniela; Muthers, Stefan; Anet, Julien; Peter, Thomas","subject":" Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"551","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The influence of ozone feedbacks on surface climate following spring arctic ozone depletion;  Geologie und Hydrologie; Links between springtime Arctic stratospheric ozone anomalies and anomalous surface weather in the Northern Hemisphere have been found recently. Stratospheric ozone thus provides valuable information which may help to improve seasonal predictability. However, the extent and causality of the ozone-surface climate coupling remain unclear and many state-of-the-art forecast models lack any representation of ozone feedbacks on planetary circulation.We investigate the importance of the ozone-surface climate coupling with two Chemistry Climate Models, contrasting simulations with fully interactive ozone against prescribed zonally averaged climatological ozone under fixed present-day boundary conditions. We focus on springtime Arctic ozone minima and compare subsequent surface patterns in runs with and without interactive ozone, thus rendering a detailed and physically-based quantification of the stratospheric ozone impact on surface climate possible.  All model simulations show a connection between Arctic ozone minima and a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in the month after the depletion in spring. Runs with interactive ozone chemistry show an amplified surface response and a % stronger Arctic Oscillation index after ozone depletion. This amplified Arctic Oscillation goes along with enhanced positive surface temperature anomalies over Eurasia. Moreover, composite surface patterns after spring ozone minima in model simulations with interactive ozone show a better agreement with composites in reanalysis data compared to runs with prescribed ozone.Mechanisms whereby stratospheric ozone affects both the stratospheric and tropospheric circulation are explored. These include the reduction of short-wave heating over the pole due to ozone loss, thus amplifying stratospheric temperature anomalies and allowing for an intensification of the polar vortex with subsequent impacts on wave propagation and the stratospheric meridional circulation. This suggests that ozone is not only passively responding to stratospheric dynamics, but actively feeds back into the circulation. Following these results, stratospheric ozone anomalies actively contribute to anomalous surface weather in spring, emphasizing the potential importance of interactive ozone chemistry for seasonal predictions.","doc_id":5291,"prior":"climate","posterior":"ozone","SDG13":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19211","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Sind Eichen Klimawandel gerecht?","authors":"Bachmann, Oliver Andrea","subject":"Eichen; Klimawandel; Urban Forestry; Baumpflege; Baumpflanzung; Vitalitätsbeurteilung; Jungbäume;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"580","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Sind Eichen Klimawandel gerecht?; Eichen; Klimawandel; Urban Forestry; Baumpflege; Baumpflanzung; Vitalitätsbeurteilung; Jungbäume;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit der Eignung von Eichen als Stadtbäume im Kontext des Klimawandels. Dies soll anhand eines Praxisbeispiels einer Eichenpflanzung auf dem Campus Liebefeld in Bern bestätigt oder validiert werden. Zusätzlich sollen unter Berücksichtigung genotypischer Merkmale Ökotypen klassifiziert werden, welche sich besonders für den Gebrauch im städtischen Umfeld eignen. Mittels Literaturrecherche wurde der aktuelle Forschungsstand von klimawandeltauglichen Stadtbäumen aufgearbeitet und kritische Faktoren identifiziert, welche sich positiv oder negativ auf eine Baumpflanzung auswirken können. Dabei wurde erkannt, dass sich die in Bern gepflanzten Eichen, Quercus robur, Quercus rubra, Quercus cerris, Quercus frainetto und Quercus palustris, alle als zukünftige Stadt- und Strassenbäume eignen, obwohl dies für Quercus palustris nur unter Einschränkungen gilt. Speziell Quercus cerris wird in allen Studien als eine der an den besten geeigneten Baumarten für den Einsatz im urbanen Kontext beschrieben. Die Plastizität von Eichen wird in der Literatur bestätigt. Die grosse Anpassungsfähigkeit von Populationen an lokale Klimabedingungen lassen auf einen variablen Genpool schliessen, welcher sich in Kontext des Klimawandels als vielversprechend erweisen könnte. Wie diese Variabilität in die Stadtbaumproduktion übernommen werden kann, bedarf weiterer Untersuchungen.  Eichen wurden mittels einer Vitalitätsbeurteilung auf ihren allgemeinen Zustand, ihren Umgang mit dem vorhergehenden Hitzesommer und ihre Regenerationsfähigkeit geprüft. Dabei bestätigte sich die Resultate aus der Literaturrecherche, dass alle Eichen sich gut von Dürreperioden erholen können.

Ausgehend von der Annahme, dass sich die Klimabewegung (auch) als Appell an die Forschung/Wissenschaft lesen lässt, einen Beitrag zu sozialem Wandel zu leisten, wird im Aufsatz die partizipative Forschung diskutiert, der wir die Möglichkeit zuschreiben, eine Neupositionierung des Menschen im Prozess der nachhaltigen Entwicklung zu begünstigen. Denn als treibende Kräfte partizipativer Forschung gelten Forderungen wie Umweltgerechtigkeit. Entlang von zwei Fallstudien wird exemplarisch skizziert, wie in angewandten partizipativen Forschungsprojekten zum Klimawandel Fragen der Umweltgerechtigkeit und damit zusammenhängend der Einkommenssicherung im Kontext der Globalisierung angegangen werden können und welche Herausforderungen sich dabei für Forschende stellen. Anschließend wird argumentiert, dass es gilt, spezifisches Wissen im Curriculum der Hochschulen zu verankern, damit (angehende) Forschende einen Beitrag zum ethischen gemeinwohlorientierten Ziel der (globalen) Klimagerechtigkeit leisten können.","doc_id":5548,"prior":"Klimagerechtigkeit","SDG13":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9855","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Swiss television reporting on climate change","authors":"Schanne, Michael; Hüsser, Angelica","subject":" Nachrichtenmedien, Journalismus und Verlagswesen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"070","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Swiss television reporting on climate change;  Nachrichtenmedien, Journalismus und Verlagswesen","doc_id":5632,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22319","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Redefining ecological engineering in the context of circular economy and sustainable development","authors":"Schönborn, Andreas; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Ecological engineering; Redefinition; Engineering design; Circular economy; Principles;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338.927, 620","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Redefining ecological engineering in the context of circular economy and sustainable development; Ecological engineering; Redefinition; Engineering design; Circular economy; Principles;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Ingenieurwesen; In the past decades, the search for a more sustainable way of global development has increased in importance in international politics and economy. A driving force is the continuing degradation of the environment in many areas of the world, often caused or accelerated by population growth and climate change. Sustainable development is seen as key approach to mitigate these processes. It has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” But how can this ambitious goal be achieved in the light of numerous global challenges? Engineering is a very influential human practice and must be addressed in this context. Engineers are crucially involved in design and construction of our built environment and thus in shaping almost its entire development. However, when designing a solution for a given problem, effects caused outside of the system borders are often not considered. If this is combined with a narrowly confined linear problem-solving approach, it is inherently prone to create new environmental challenges. We postulate that the development of a new design paradigm for engineering must be part of the progress towards sustainable development. We think that this new paradigm needs to integrate a sound understanding of ecological principles, processes, and interdependencies as well as thorough system thinking. We call this ecology-inspired approach to engineering “ecological engineering” and redefine it as follows: Ecological Engineering integrates ecological principles, processes, and organisms with existing engineering practice to a holistic approach for problem-solving. In this paper, we explore the historical development of earlier definitions of Ecological Engineering in the light of their underlying value systems. Based on this analysis, we propose a new conceptual approach for Ecological Engineering and define seven principles that point the way towards a future label that can be conferred to Good Ecological Engineering Practice.","doc_id":5910,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8907","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Impact of solar versus volcanic activity variations on tropospheric temperatures and precipitation during the Dalton Minimum","authors":"Anet, J.

Separate variations in the (i) solar irradiance in the UV-C with wavelengths λ <  nm, (ii) irradiance at wavelengths λ >  nm, (iii) in energetic particle spectrum, and (iv) volcanic aerosol forcing were analyzed separately, and (v) in combination, by means of small ensemble calculations using a coupled atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate model. Global and hemispheric mean surface temperatures show a significant dependence on solar irradiance at λ >  nm. Also, powerful volcanic eruptions in , ,  and  significantly decreased global mean temperature by up to . K for - years after the eruption. However, while the volcanic effect is clearly discernible in the Southern Hemispheric mean temperature, it is less significant in the Northern Hemisphere, partly because the two largest volcanic eruptions occurred in the SH tropics and during seasons when the aerosols were mainly transported southward, partly because of the higher northern internal variability. In the simulation including all forcings, temperatures are in reasonable agreement with the tree ring-based temperature anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere. Interestingly, the model suggests that solar irradiance changes at λ <  nm and in energetic particle spectra have only an insignificant impact on the climate during the Dalton Minimum. This downscales the importance of top–down processes (stemming from changes at λ <  nm) relative to bottom–up processes (from λ >  nm). Reduction of irradiance at λ >  nm leads to a significant (up to %) decrease in the ocean heat content (OHC) between  and  m in depth, whereas the changes in irradiance at λ <  nm or in energetic particles have virtually no effect. Also, volcanic aerosol yields a very strong response, reducing the OHC of the upper ocean by up to .%. In the simulation with all forcings, the OHC of the uppermost levels recovers after - years after volcanic eruption, while the solar signal and the different volcanic eruptions dominate the OHC changes in the deeper ocean and prevent its recovery during the DM. Finally, the simulations suggest that the volcanic eruptions during the DM had a significant impact on the precipitation patterns caused by a widening of the Hadley cell and a shift in the intertropical convergence zone.","doc_id":6063,"prior":"climate","posterior":"atmosphere-ocean","SDG13":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18105","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts","authors":"Stucki, Matthias; Wettstein, Sarah; Amrein, Simon; Mathis, Alex","subject":"LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts; LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Goal: Peat extraction leads to environmental damage in terms of climate and biodiversity.

As mental disorders are often recognized delayed or not at all, mental health promotion and the early detection of mental illness in childhood are relevant public health tasks. Pediatric practices are a particularly suitable setting for such efforts are as they do have regular and direct contact with most children. This project therefore aimed to develop materials to raise parents' awareness of children's mental health and provide specific suggestions for mental health promotion and screening for mental health problems.Methods: A systematic literature review in the field of mental health promotion, clinical psychology and positive psychology on life skills and resilience revealed several effective concepts. In a participatory process with psychiatrists and pediatricians, ten concepts were selected: self-esteem, self-efficacy, problem solving skills, optimism, emotion regulation, recreation, family climate, nature, offline-activities, and peer support. In a preliminary evaluation of parents' perspective on a parent-brochure,  parents of --year-old kids filled in two online-questionnaires on the perceived relevance and usefulness of the ten concepts and the respective behavioral suggestions; one right after learning about the recommendations and one four weeks later.Results: First analysis show that parents perceive the recommendations as highly relevant and useful at both measurement time points and that they integrated many of them in their everyday family life.Conclusions: Resource-oriented suggestions on the promotion of mental health in children seem to offer a non-stigmatizing way to address mental health topics in the pediatric practice. In a next step, we plan to field-test the evaluation and uptake of the accompanying information brochure by pediatricians.","doc_id":6288,"prior":"climate","posterior":"awareness","SDG13":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1233","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Förderung der erneuerbaren inländischen Stromproduktion : eine ökonomische Analyse","authors":"Schleiniger, Reto","subject":"Strommarkt; Erneuerbare Energien; Finanzielle Förderung;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Förderung der erneuerbaren inländischen Stromproduktion : eine ökonomische Analyse; Strommarkt; Erneuerbare Energien; Finanzielle Förderung;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Da die Schweiz die bestehenden Atomkraftwerke nach Ablauf ihrer Betriebsdauer nicht ersetzen wird, stellt sich die Frage, ob in diesem politischen Umfeld eine spezielle Förderung der einheimischen erneuerbaren Stromproduktion sinnvoll ist und wie eine solche Förderung aussehen soll.Ökonomisch lässt sich eine Förderung dadurch begründen, dass ohne vermehrte inländische Produktion die Auslandsabhängigkeit zunimmt und zugleich die Gefahr besteht, dass Strom vermehrt in ausländischen Kernkraftwerken produziert wird. Beide Effekte sind mit Externalitäten verbunden und führen zu Marktversagen, das durch staatliche Eingriffe korrigiert werden kann.Die Förderung einheimischer erneuerbarer Stromproduktion hat dagegen keinen Einfluss auf die CO-Emissionen, weil diese direkt über bereits bestehende Instrumente der Klimapolitik in der Schweiz und in der Europäischen Union so reguliert werden, dass die Emissionsmengen von der Art der Stromproduktion nicht beeinflusst werden.Von den verschiedenen finanziellen Förderinstrumenten löst die flexible Einspeiseprämie, bei welchem die Prämie als Differenz zwischen einem Vergütungspreis und einem über die Zeit gemittelten Marktpreis berechnet wird, das Dilemma zwischen Investitionssicherheit und Marktnähe am besten.","doc_id":6621,"prior":"Klimapolitik","SDG13":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2382","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Swiss energy policy in translation","authors":"Bale, Richard James; Ehrensberger-Dow, Maureen; Pescia De Lellis, Lorenza","subject":"Energiediskurse Publikation; Websites; Switzerland; Multilingualism;  Energie;  Translationswissenschaft","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"333.79, 418.02","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Swiss energy policy in translation; Energiediskurse Publikation; Websites; Switzerland; Multilingualism;  Energie;  Translationswissenschaft; With an increased societal focus on issues such as climate change, the way governments communicate with their citizens about energy policy has grown in importance.

We find that geomagnetic field minima ~ ka, in combination with Grand Solar Minima, caused substantial changes in atmospheric ozone concentration and circulation, driving synchronous global climate shifts that caused major environmental changes, extinction events, and transformations in the archaeological record.","doc_id":6952,"prior":"climate","posterior":"atmospheric","SDG13":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20032","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Public acceptance of technologies to tackle climate change","authors":"Jobin, Marilou","subject":" Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Dissertation","bid":"338.927","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Public acceptance of technologies to tackle climate change;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","doc_id":7044,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"3","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22449","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Plant functional and taxonomic diversity in European grasslands along climatic gradients","authors":"Boonman, Coline C.F.; Santini, Luca; Robroek, Bjorn J.M.; Hoeks, Selwyn; Kelderman, Steven; Dengler, Jürgen; Bergamini, Ariel; Biurrun, Idoia; Carranza, Maria Laura; Cerabolini, Bruno E.L.; Chytrý, Milan; Jandt, Ute; Lysenko, Tatiana; Stanisci, Angela; Tatarenko, Irina; Rūsiņa, Solvita; Huijbregts, Mark A.J.","subject":"Environmental filtering; Favourability hypothesis; Functional richness; Grassland diversity; Limiting similarity; Null model; Plant trait diversity; Precipitation gradient; Seasonality; Taxonomic richness; Temperature gradient; Trait-environment relationship;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 580","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Plant functional and taxonomic diversity in European grasslands along climatic gradients; Environmental filtering; Favourability hypothesis; Functional richness; Grassland diversity; Limiting similarity; Null model; Plant trait diversity; Precipitation gradient; Seasonality; Taxonomic richness; Temperature gradient; Trait-environment relationship;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik); AimEuropean grassland communities are highly diverse, but patterns and drivers of their continental‐scale diversity remain elusive. This study analyses taxonomic and functional richness in European grasslands along continental‐scale temperature and precipitation gradients.LocationEurope.MethodsWe quantified functional and taxonomic richness of , vegetation plots. Six plant traits, related to resource acquisition and conservation, were analysed to describe plant community functional composition. Using a null‐model approach we derived functional richness effect sizes that indicate higher or lower diversity than expected given the taxonomic richness. We assessed the variation in absolute functional and taxonomic richness and in functional richness effect sizes along gradients of minimum temperature, temperature range, annual precipitation, and precipitation seasonality using a multiple general additive modelling approach.ResultsFunctional and taxonomic richness was high at intermediate minimum temperatures and wide temperature ranges. Functional and taxonomic richness was low in correspondence with low minimum temperatures or narrow temperature ranges. Functional richness increased and taxonomic richness decreased at higher minimum temperatures and wide annual temperature ranges. Both functional and taxonomic richness decreased with increasing precipitation seasonality and showed a small increase at intermediate annual precipitation. Overall, effect sizes of functional richness were small. However, effect sizes indicated trait divergence at extremely low minimum temperatures and at low annual precipitation with extreme precipitation seasonality.ConclusionsFunctional and taxonomic richness of European grassland communities vary considerably over temperature and precipitation gradients. Overall, they follow similar patterns over the climate gradients, except at high minimum temperatures and wide temperature ranges, where functional richness increases and taxonomic richness decreases. This contrasting pattern may trigger new ideas for studies that target specific hypotheses focused on community assembly processes. And though effect sizes were small, they indicate that it may be important to consider climate seasonality in plant diversity studies.","doc_id":7048,"prior":"climate","posterior":"extreme","SDG13":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23726","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Climbing ropes : environmental hotspots in their life cycle and potentials for optimization","authors":"Bradford, Sebastian; Rupf, Reto; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Climbing rope; Polyamide; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Product development; Outdoor activities; Mountaineering; User behaviour; Greenhouse gas emissions;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"338.927","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Climbing ropes : environmental hotspots in their life cycle and potentials for optimization; Climbing rope; Polyamide; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Product development; Outdoor activities; Mountaineering; User behaviour; Greenhouse gas emissions;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Mountain sports are affected by climate change in a way which few other sports are.

It is therefore important to understand and forecast future reservoir sedimentation processes with regard to climate change. In the present project, particle size distribution (PSD) and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were measured in three reservoirs in the Swiss Alps whose catchment areas are covered by glaciers by at least %. The threefold combination of water sample analysis, laser in-situ scattering and transmissometry (LISST) and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was applied and the results compared to each other. The combination of the three measuring techniques was proven suitable for assessing PSD and SSC in periglacial reservoirs. Water sample analysis and LISST records showed that most of the suspended sediments in the reservoir are in the range of clay and silt. SSC was relatively low in the order of  mg/l. An increase of both PSD (e.g. median diameter d) and SSC with increasing reservoir depth could be observed in deep reservoirs. Flow velocities and Signal-to-Noise ratios (SNR) were measured with ADCP. SNR values allowed to study the mixing of inflowing river water and the evolution and decay of turbidity currents. There is evidence of dominant homopycnal flows, i.e. stratified flow was restricted to the regions close to the inflow. Flocculation, influence of mica, and organic content could be neglected. This paper presents detailed information about PSD and SSC gained with water sample analysis and LISST measurements. Furthermore, flow field measurements and tracking of mixing by means of ADCP will be illustrated. Finally, application experiences and limitations will be discussed.","doc_id":7213,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21943","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Schweizer Futtermittelimporte : Entwicklung, Hintergründe, Folgen","authors":"Baur, Priska; Krayer, Patricia","subject":"Futtermittelimporte; Futtermittelbilanz; Raufutter; Kraftfutter; Mischfutter; Tierproduktion; Tierbestände; Wiederkäuer; Monogastrier; Rindvieh; Geflügelmast; Pouletproduktion; Soja; Soja nach Tierarten; Eiweissfutter; Protein; Globale Sojaproduktion; Globale Sojaverwendung; Brasilien; Amazonas; Cerrado; Lieferkette Fleisch; Marktkonzentration; Coop; Migros; Fenaco; Proviande; Fleischwerbung; Soja Netzwerk Schweiz; Treibhausgas-Emissionen; Stickstoffbilanz; Ökosystemgrenzen; Ackerland pro Kopf; Selbstversorgungsgrad; Ernährungssicherheit; Versorgungssicherheit; Schweizer Tierhaltung; BTS; RAUS; ÖLN; Schweizer Landwirtschaft; Bundesamt für Landwirtschaft; Agrarpolitik; Imported feedstuff; Domestic food; Roughage; Concentrated feed; Livestock; Ruminants; Cattle; Poultry; Soy; Soymeal; Animal protein feedstuff; Supply chain; Market concentration; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrogen surplus; Ecosystem boundaries; Food security; Switzerland; Swiss agriculture; Swiss agricultural policy;  Produktion;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"338, 630","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Schweizer Futtermittelimporte : Entwicklung, Hintergründe, Folgen; Futtermittelimporte; Futtermittelbilanz; Raufutter; Kraftfutter; Mischfutter; Tierproduktion; Tierbestände; Wiederkäuer; Monogastrier; Rindvieh; Geflügelmast; Pouletproduktion; Soja; Soja nach Tierarten; Eiweissfutter; Protein; Globale Sojaproduktion; Globale Sojaverwendung; Brasilien; Amazonas; Cerrado; Lieferkette Fleisch; Marktkonzentration; Coop; Migros; Fenaco; Proviande; Fleischwerbung; Soja Netzwerk Schweiz; Treibhausgas-Emissionen; Stickstoffbilanz; Ökosystemgrenzen; Ackerland pro Kopf; Selbstversorgungsgrad; Ernährungssicherheit; Versorgungssicherheit; Schweizer Tierhaltung; BTS; RAUS; ÖLN; Schweizer Landwirtschaft; Bundesamt für Landwirtschaft; Agrarpolitik; Imported feedstuff; Domestic food; Roughage; Concentrated feed; Livestock; Ruminants; Cattle; Poultry; Soy; Soymeal; Animal protein feedstuff; Supply chain; Market concentration; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrogen surplus; Ecosystem boundaries; Food security; Switzerland; Swiss agriculture; Swiss agricultural policy;  Produktion;  Landwirtschaft; Supplementary material:Tierfutter von einheimischen Wiesen und Feldern - Recherchebericht Nr.  zum Forschungsprojekt «Schweizer Futtermittelimporte» https://doi.org/./zenodo.Tierfutter aus anderen Ländern (Importe) - Recherchebericht Nr.  zum Forschungsprojekt «Schweizer Futtermittelimporte» https://doi.org/./zenodo.Soja – das global wichtigste Eiweissfutter für die Tierproduktion - Recherchebericht Nr.  zum Forschungsprojekt «Schweizer Futtermittelimporte» https://doi.org/./zenodo.Brasilien – Sojaproduzent im Rampenlicht - Recherchebericht Nr.  zum Forschungsprojekt «Schweizer Futtermittelimporte» https://doi.org/./zenodo.Kalorienverluste durch die Tierproduktion - Recherchebericht Nr.  zum Forschungsprojekt «Schweizer Futtermittelimporte» https://doi.org/./zenodo.; The aim of this research project is to demonstrate the many dimensions of importing feedstuff, to clarify the significance of imported feedstuff for animal production in Switzerland, as well as to assess the negative environmental impacts of such importation both within Switzerland and in the countries of origin. In particular, the importance of soy as an element in feedstuff is examined in depth.The analysis is centred around the misleading statement that % of the feedstuff in Switzerland comes from ‘native meadows and fields’. This percentage is based on the combination of roughage and concentrated feed, two categories of feedstuff that must not be added because they have limited substitutability and are therefore not directly comparable. Roughage is eaten mainly by ruminants. Meat, however, comes primarily from pigs and poultry which are both dependent on concentrated feed. Roughage is almost % domestically sourced, while more than % of concentrated feed comes from abroad. Protein is particularly scarce: around % of the protein in concentrated feed comes from imports (mainly soy).Therefore, if today’s feedstuff were not imported, livestock populations would decline significantly, particularly those that are dependent on concentrated feed. According to model calculations, it would be possible to keep % of sheep and goats, % of cattle, % of pigs and % of poultry on the basis of domestic feed alone. At  kg per capita per year, meat production would be halved in comparison to the present day. Pork would remain the most important type of meat, although it would be over % less compared to today. Poultry meat would virtually disappear. However, around  kg of milk could still be produced per capita annually.Swiss agriculture specialises in the production of livestock. About % of agricultural land is used for animal feed, in addition to the at least , hectares of arable areas abroad which are used for the cultivation of animal feedstuff for the Swiss market. Soybeans, wheat, corn, etc. grow on these areas.Since the mid-s, the importing of feedstuff has increased sharply, most of which is imported from Europe. The most important protein feed which is imported is soy, which, due to public criticism, now tends to increasingly come from Europe. Most of the imported feedstuffs are in direct competition with human foods. This is because they come from crops that we humans can eat directly, including not only all cereals such as wheat, corn, rice, oats and barley, but also soybeans.In intensive livestock farming, the calorie content present in plant-based foods that we humans are able eat directly is converted into a lot less in animal food products. In this process, the production of meat ‘destroys’ significantly more plant-derived calories than that of milk. This is because milk still contains a lot of grass that only cows and other ruminants can digest.Soy is the world's most important animal protein feedstuff. Originally, soybeans were cultivated in Asia for human consumption. Today, about % of global production is used to feed livestock, more than half of which is used for chicken fattening. While poultry consume by far the most soy protein feed on a global scale, in Switzerland it is cattle which rank first in this regard. This is the result of the central importance of milk production and the breeding of performance breeds that depend on protein-rich concentrated feed.Global soy production has grown steadily in recent years, and in Brazil even exponentially. Approximately half of all soy is used for feeding or consumption purposes in growing countries, while the other half is traded internationally. The main producing and exporting countries are the U.S. and Brazil while the main importing countries are China and the EU.Brazil is still the most important source region for Swiss soybean imports. The country grows soybeans for the global market: around % of production is exported. Only % of Brazil's farms cultivate soybeans and only % of soybean farms are family-owned. In the past  years production has expanded, especially in the ecologically valuable Cerrado and Amazon biomes. There, the average soybean acreage is  ha (Amazonas) and  ha (Cerrado).The supply chains for soy imported into Switzerland are not transparent. The description ‘responsibly produced’ glosses over soy production in Brazil and the soy trade. According to research, Swiss soy imports from Brazil come from specialised, large-scale farms with intensive soy cultivation, monotonous crop rotations and high pesticide use. Most of these farms are located in the state of Mato Grosso, i.e. in the Cerrado or Amazon biome, where most land has been cleared in recent decades.ProTerra-certified soy also comes from original rainforest (Amazon) or savanna (Cerrado) areas. ‘Zero deforestation’ refers only to the last decade.Animal food products constitutes a billion-dollar business in Switzerland. The supply chains show a high market concentration in inputs (feedstuff), in processing (meat, dairy milk) and in wholesale and retail trade. A few companies, especially the conglomerates Coop, Migros and fenaco, dominate the markets. The industrialisation of production in efficient international supply chains is most advanced in the production of eggs and chicken. Here, too, the supply chains are not very transparent.According to model calculations, more than % of the total greenhouse gas emissions due to Swiss agriculture are directly attributable to livestock farming, % to the rest of agriculture and about % occur in the countries where animal feedstuff is grown. If feedstuff were not imported, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by %. The nitrogen surpluses in Swiss agriculture are also largely a result of livestock farming. More than % of the surpluses occur in Switzerland. Without feedstuff imports, the nitrogen surpluses in Switzerland would be reduced by %.The results of the research and model calculations thus lead to five conclusions:I.\tThe industry's advertising images and messages are misleading and gloss over livestock farming in Switzerland and its dependence on imports.

In particular, the importance of soy as an element in feedstuff is examined in depth.The analysis is centred around the misleading statement that % of the feedstuff in Switzerland comes from ‘native meadows and fields’. This percentage is based on the combination of roughage and concentrated feed, two categories of feedstuff that must not be added because they have limited substitutability and are therefore not directly comparable. Roughage is eaten mainly by ruminants. Meat, however, comes primarily from pigs and poultry which are both dependent on concentrated feed. Roughage is almost % domestically sourced, while more than % of concentrated feed comes from abroad. Protein is particularly scarce: around % of the protein in concentrated feed comes from imports (mainly soy).Therefore, if today’s feedstuff were not imported, livestock populations would decline significantly, particularly those that are dependent on concentrated feed. According to model calculations, it would be possible to keep % of sheep and goats, % of cattle, % of pigs and % of poultry on the basis of domestic feed alone. At  kg per capita per year, meat production would be halved in comparison to the present day. Pork would remain the most important type of meat, although it would be over % less compared to today. Poultry meat would virtually disappear. However, around  kg of milk could still be produced per capita annually.Swiss agriculture specialises in the production of livestock. About % of agricultural land is used for animal feed, in addition to the at least , hectares of arable areas abroad which are used for the cultivation of animal feedstuff for the Swiss market. Soybeans, wheat, corn, etc. grow on these areas.Since the mid-s, the importing of feedstuff has increased sharply, most of which is imported from Europe. The most important protein feed which is imported is soy, which, due to public criticism, now tends to increasingly come from Europe. Most of the imported feedstuffs are in direct competition with human foods. This is because they come from crops that we humans can eat directly, including not only all cereals such as wheat, corn, rice, oats and barley, but also soybeans.In intensive livestock farming, the calorie content present in plant-based foods that we humans are able eat directly is converted into a lot less in animal food products. In this process, the production of meat ‘destroys’ significantly more plant-derived calories than that of milk. This is because milk still contains a lot of grass that only cows and other ruminants can digest.Soy is the world's most important animal protein feedstuff. Originally, soybeans were cultivated in Asia for human consumption. Today, about % of global production is used to feed livestock, more than half of which is used for chicken fattening. While poultry consume by far the most soy protein feed on a global scale, in Switzerland it is cattle which rank first in this regard. This is the result of the central importance of milk production and the breeding of performance breeds that depend on protein-rich concentrated feed.Global soy production has grown steadily in recent years, and in Brazil even exponentially. Approximately half of all soy is used for feeding or consumption purposes in growing countries, while the other half is traded internationally. The main producing and exporting countries are the U.S. and Brazil while the main importing countries are China and the EU.Brazil is still the most important source region for Swiss soybean imports. The country grows soybeans for the global market: around % of production is exported. Only % of Brazil's farms cultivate soybeans and only % of soybean farms are family-owned. In the past  years production has expanded, especially in the ecologically valuable Cerrado and Amazon biomes. There, the average soybean acreage is  ha (Amazonas) and  ha (Cerrado).The supply chains for soy imported into Switzerland are not transparent.

In particular, the importance of soy as an element in feedstuff is examined in depth.The analysis is centred around the misleading statement that % of the feedstuff in Switzerland comes from ‘native meadows and fields’. This percentage is based on the combination of roughage and concentrated feed, two categories of feedstuff that must not be added because they have limited substitutability and are therefore not directly comparable. Roughage is eaten mainly by ruminants. Meat, however, comes primarily from pigs and poultry which are both dependent on concentrated feed. Roughage is almost % domestically sourced, while more than % of concentrated feed comes from abroad. Protein is particularly scarce: around % of the protein in concentrated feed comes from imports (mainly soy).Therefore, if today’s feedstuff were not imported, livestock populations would decline significantly, particularly those that are dependent on concentrated feed. According to model calculations, it would be possible to keep % of sheep and goats, % of cattle, % of pigs and % of poultry on the basis of domestic feed alone. At  kg per capita per year, meat production would be halved in comparison to the present day. Pork would remain the most important type of meat, although it would be over % less compared to today. Poultry meat would virtually disappear. However, around  kg of milk could still be produced per capita annually.Swiss agriculture specialises in the production of livestock. About % of agricultural land is used for animal feed, in addition to the at least , hectares of arable areas abroad which are used for the cultivation of animal feedstuff for the Swiss market. Soybeans, wheat, corn, etc. grow on these areas.Since the mid-s, the importing of feedstuff has increased sharply, most of which is imported from Europe. The most important protein feed which is imported is soy, which, due to public criticism, now tends to increasingly come from Europe. Most of the imported feedstuffs are in direct competition with human foods. This is because they come from crops that we humans can eat directly, including not only all cereals such as wheat, corn, rice, oats and barley, but also soybeans.In intensive livestock farming, the calorie content present in plant-based foods that we humans are able eat directly is converted into a lot less in animal food products. In this process, the production of meat ‘destroys’ significantly more plant-derived calories than that of milk. This is because milk still contains a lot of grass that only cows and other ruminants can digest.Soy is the world's most important animal protein feedstuff. Originally, soybeans were cultivated in Asia for human consumption. Today, about % of global production is used to feed livestock, more than half of which is used for chicken fattening. While poultry consume by far the most soy protein feed on a global scale, in Switzerland it is cattle which rank first in this regard. This is the result of the central importance of milk production and the breeding of performance breeds that depend on protein-rich concentrated feed.Global soy production has grown steadily in recent years, and in Brazil even exponentially. Approximately half of all soy is used for feeding or consumption purposes in growing countries, while the other half is traded internationally. The main producing and exporting countries are the U.S. and Brazil while the main importing countries are China and the EU.Brazil is still the most important source region for Swiss soybean imports. The country grows soybeans for the global market: around % of production is exported. Only % of Brazil's farms cultivate soybeans and only % of soybean farms are family-owned. In the past  years production has expanded, especially in the ecologically valuable Cerrado and Amazon biomes. There, the average soybean acreage is  ha (Amazonas) and  ha (Cerrado).The supply chains for soy imported into Switzerland are not transparent. The description ‘responsibly produced’ glosses over soy production in Brazil and the soy trade. According to research, Swiss soy imports from Brazil come from specialised, large-scale farms with intensive soy cultivation, monotonous crop rotations and high pesticide use. Most of these farms are located in the state of Mato Grosso, i.e. in the Cerrado or Amazon biome, where most land has been cleared in recent decades.ProTerra-certified soy also comes from original rainforest (Amazon) or savanna (Cerrado) areas. ‘Zero deforestation’ refers only to the last decade.Animal food products constitutes a billion-dollar business in Switzerland. The supply chains show a high market concentration in inputs (feedstuff), in processing (meat, dairy milk) and in wholesale and retail trade. A few companies, especially the conglomerates Coop, Migros and fenaco, dominate the markets. The industrialisation of production in efficient international supply chains is most advanced in the production of eggs and chicken. Here, too, the supply chains are not very transparent.According to model calculations, more than % of the total greenhouse gas emissions due to Swiss agriculture are directly attributable to livestock farming, % to the rest of agriculture and about % occur in the countries where animal feedstuff is grown. If feedstuff were not imported, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by %. The nitrogen surpluses in Swiss agriculture are also largely a result of livestock farming. More than % of the surpluses occur in Switzerland. Without feedstuff imports, the nitrogen surpluses in Switzerland would be reduced by %.The results of the research and model calculations thus lead to five conclusions:I.\tThe industry's advertising images and messages are misleading and gloss over livestock farming in Switzerland and its dependence on imports. They shape the perceptions of the population and increase the demand for animal food products \"from Switzerland\".II.\tGovernmental agencies do little to educate the population about Swiss livestock farming. They support the misleading images and messages through official terminology and reporting. Political interests favour production and sales interests over the many other societal concerns (e.g. health, environment, animal welfare, transparency, economic costs, reliability of supply).III.\tIt is not Swiss agriculture that benefits most from fedstuff imports. This is because agriculture does not depend solely on production for its income; it receives income-securing direct payments. Rather, imports are in the interest of upstream and downstream industries. They are the ones who mainly benefit from a high rate of livestock farming at discounted prices.IV.\tSwiss chicken production is a clear example: the doubling of production in the last  years has benefited a few upstream and downstream companies, a handful of global breeding companies and only a very small proportion of farms. The expansion of chicken fattening is a questionable development in Swiss livestock farming. It is further encouraged by the current debate concerning the environment and the climate as chicken is considered resource-efficient and ‘climate friendly’.V.\tAs a guiding principle for the future, it is proposed that Swiss livestock farming be adapted to the local ecosystem boundaries in Switzerland, and that the consumption by the Swiss population be adapted to global ecosystem boundaries. This would mean being able to halve meat consumption at the very least.","doc_id":7260,"prior":"climate","posterior":"greenhouse","SDG13":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21566","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Extending the lifetime of mobile devices to reduce their environmental impact : a glimpse on the project LIFESAVING","authors":"Jobin, Marilou; Külling, Céline; Jattke, Marleen; Blumer, Yann","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"363","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Extending the lifetime of mobile devices to reduce their environmental impact : a glimpse on the project LIFESAVING;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Mobile Internet-enabled devices (MIEDs) such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets have become a crucial part of our lives.

One important task of models is to identify the causes of the observed (total and spectral)irradiance variations. Another major aim is to reconstruct irradiance over time scales longer than sampled by direct measurements in order to consider if and to what extent solar irradiance variations may be responsible for global climate change. Here, we describe recent efforts to model solar irradiance over the current and the previous two solar cycles. These irradiance models are remarkably successful in reproducing the observed total and spectral irradiance, although further improvements are still possible.","doc_id":7984,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"21","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19049","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Simulation of contamination by exhaust emissions from docked marine vessels","authors":"Zubiaga, Asier; Khawaja, H.

Einerseits wurden technische Massnahmen und andererseits auch Suffizienz-Massnahmen untersucht. Neben dem Potential zur Reduktion der COeq-Emissionen wurde für die technischen Massnahmen auch die zu erwartenden volkswirtschaftlichen Einsparungen oder Kosten analysiert. Bei der Auswahl der Massnahmen lag der Fokus auf etablierten und kostengünstigen Technologien oder Verfahren, welche ab heute eingesetzt werden könnten. Die in der vorliegenden Studie verwendete Methodik ist grundsätzlich dieselbe, welche McKinsey im Jahr  verwendete, um eine Analyse zu den COeq-Reduktionskosten verschiedener Massnahmen zur Reduktion der Treibhausgase in der Schweiz durchzuführen (McKinsey, b). McKinsey hatte die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten der verschiedenen Massnahmen untersucht. Steuern, Subventionen oder indirekte Kosten, wie zum Beispiel externe Kosten, die als Folge des Klimawandels entstehen, wurden nicht berücksichtigt. Seit der Veröffentlichung der Studie von McKinsey hat die technologische Entwicklung grosse Fortschritte gemacht und die Kosten vieler emissionsarmer Technologien, wie Photovoltaik und Elektroautos, sind erheblich gesunken. Die vorliegende Studie berücksichtigt diese Entwicklungen und analysiert die Reduktionskosten basierend auf aktuellen Daten. Das Reduktionspotential der Massnahmen wurde ermittelt, indem die Emissionen, die bei der Umsetzung der Massnahmen entstehen, mit den Emissionen im Referenzfall ohne Massnahmen verglichen wurden. Analog wurden die Kosten der technischen Massnahmen mit den Kosten des Referenzfalls verglichen. Für die Referenzfälle wurde basierend auf den Prognosen der Energieperspektiven  des Bundes (Prognos, ) und anderen Studien (Infras, ; TEP Energy & Ecoplan, ) evaluiert, wie viele Emissionen im Jahr  ohne Umsetzung der untersuchten Massnahmen entstehen.Nicht alle technischen Massnahmen verursachen Mehrkosten gegenüber dem Referenzfall. Bei einigen Massnahmen führen geringere Energie- und/oder Unterhaltskosten insgesamt zu Kosteneinsparungen. Um die Kosteneffizienz der verschiedenen technischen Massnahmen bezüglich COeq-Reduktion zu vergleichen, wurden die jährlichen Kosten ins Verhältnis zum jährlichen Reduktionspotential gesetzt und so die spezifischen Reduktionskosten pro vermiedene Tonne COeq-Emissionen berechnet. Die Ergebnisse zu den technischen Massnahmen sind in einer COeq-Reduktionskostenkurve dargestellt und zeigen das COeq-Reduktionspotential auf der horizontalen Achse und die COeq-Reduktionskosten auf der senkrechten Achse (Abbildung ). Sowohl das Potential wie auch die Kosten wurden für das Jahr  berechnet. Gemäss dem schweizerischen Treibhausgasinventar, welches Emissionen nach dem Territorialprinzip berücksichtigt, betrug im Jahr  der COeq-Ausstoss der Schweiz . Mio. tCOeq (BAFU, b). Durch Steigerung der Energieeffizienz und teilweise Umstellung auf fossilfreie Technologien kann im Referenzszenario der COeq-Austoss der gesamten Schweiz bis  auf . Mio. tCOeq reduziert werden (Schweizerischer Bundesrat, ). Die in Abbildung  gezeigten technischen Massnahmen gehen bei der Umstellung auf fossilfreie Technologien viel weiter als das Referenzszenario und mit ihrer Umsetzung könnten zusätzlich . Mio. tCOeq eingespart werden, sodass der COeq-Austoss der Schweiz im Jahr  auf .

Here, we present the first multisite biodiversity × drought manipulation experiment to examine drought resistance and recovery at five temperate and Mediterranean grassland sites. Aboveground biomass production declined by % due to experimental drought (standardised local extremity by rainfall exclusion for - consecutive days). Species richness did not affect resistance but promoted recovery. Recovery was only positively affected by species richness in low-productive communities, with most diverse communities even showing overcompensation.

Wenn wir eine übermässige Erwärmung unseres Planeten vermeiden wollen, müssen wir schnellst-möglich «Netto» keine Treibhausgase (THG) mehr in die Atmosphäre emittieren. Da etwa ¾ der durch Schweizer verursachten THG-Emissionen auf den Energiesektor fallen sind weitgehende Änderungen in diesem Bereich notwendig. Durch die Dekarbonisierung der Mobilität und des Gebäudesektors wird es mehr nachhaltigen Strom benötigen, dabei hat in der Schweiz vor allem die Photovoltaik-Technologie das Potenzial die Energiewende herbeizuführen. Diese Arbeit beschreibt den Entwicklungsprozess eines Geschäftsmodelles, welches eine digitalisierte Photovoltaik-Crowdfunding Applikation anbieten soll. Dabei sollte eine deutliche Weiterentwicklung der Grundidee einer Solargenossenschaft entstehen. Verbesserungen werden in der schnellen, benutzerfreundlichen Kundenakquise und einer möglichst geringen Mindestinvestition angestrebt. Das Ziel ist, dadurch eine breitere, unter anderem auch jüngere, Zielgruppe zu erreichen. Motivatoren waren unter anderen die immer schneller werdende Adaption von digitalen Dienstleistungen, neue technische Möglichkeiten der Stückelung von Wertanlagen und ein Mangel an sicheren Rendite-Anlagen.Climate change is arguably one of, if not the biggest, problem of our generation. If we want to avoid excessive warming of our planet, we have to rapidly stop emitting more greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere than carbon sinks can store. Since about ¾ of the GHG emissions caused by the Swiss fall on the energy sector, far-reaching changes are necessary in this area. Due to the decarbonization of the mobility and the building sector, more sustainable electricity will be needed. In Switzerland photovoltaic technology has the potential to be the main driver of the energy transition. This thesis describes the development process of a business model, which should offer a digitalized photovoltaic crowdfunding application. Thereby, a significant enhancement of the basic idea of a solar cooperative should emerge. Improvements are aimed at fast, user-friendly customer acquisition and the lowest possible minimal investment. The goal is to reach a broader, also younger, target group. Motivators were, among others, the ever faster adaptation of digital services, new technical possibilities for the atomization of investment assets and a lack of safe yield investments.","doc_id":8827,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7386","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Einfluss von Klimawandel und Nutzungsaufgabe auf Vegetation und Landschaft im Oberengadin (Schweizer Alpen) in den kommenden 100 Jahren","authors":"Krüsi, Bertil O.","subject":"Succession; Upper Engadine; Climate change; Deglaciation;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"333.7, 363","year":"2007","for_data_analysis":"Einfluss von Klimawandel und Nutzungsaufgabe auf Vegetation und Landschaft im Oberengadin (Schweizer Alpen) in den kommenden  Jahren; Succession; Upper Engadine; Climate change; Deglaciation;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Impacts of global warming and land abandonment on vegetation and landscape in the Upper Engadine valley (Swiss Alps) during the coming  years• During the coming  years, two main driving forces will change the Alpine landscape, viz.

Regression analyses of HI_MET versus altitude lead to predicted HI’s which match more closely the expected HI_MET incases of big differences of HI_MET and HI_GRD. Level of confidence of HI_MET versus altitude was higher than the one of HI_GRD. The results suggest investigating the interpolation of HIs in comparison to His calculated on interpolated temperatures.","doc_id":9062,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"80","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15194","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The perception and knowledge of climate change and values of ETH members : project report of the ETH-wide online survey about Climate Change within the framework of the CCES project ClimPol","authors":"El Benni, Nadja; Tikir, Aysel","subject":"Theory of planned behavior; Cultural theory; Risk perception; Climate change;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"363","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"The perception and knowledge of climate change and values of ETH members : project report of the ETH-wide online survey about Climate Change within the framework of the CCES project ClimPol; Theory of planned behavior; Cultural theory; Risk perception; Climate change;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; The aim of the current study is to analyse the perception of Climate Change as well as to explain the intentions to behave climate-friendly.

We focus on the Visp region in the Upper Valais, Switzerland, and ask how the process of stakeholder involvement in research practice can contribute to a better understanding of the specific challenges and future development of mountainous regions under global change. Based on a coupled human-environment system (HES) perspective, we carried out a formative scenario analysis to develop a set of scenarios for the future directions of the Visp region. In addition, we linked these regional scenarios to context scenarios developed at the global and Swiss levels via an external consistency analysis. This method allows the coupling of both the scenario building process and the scenarios as such. We used a functional-dynamic approach to theory-practice cooperation, i.e., the involvement of key stakeholders from, for example, tourism, forestry, and administration, differed in type and intensity during the steps of the research process. In our study, we experienced strong problem awareness among the stakeholders concerning the impacts of global change and local challenges. The guiding research question was commonly defined and problem ownership was more or less balanced. We arrived at six multiscale scenarios that open up future trajectories for the Visp region, and present generic strategies to cope with global and local challenges. The results show that local identity, spatial planning, community budget, and demographic development are important steering elements in the region’s future development. We suggest that method-guided transdisciplinary processes result in a richer picture and a more systemic understanding, which enable a discussion of critical and surprising issues.","doc_id":9406,"prior":"climate","posterior":"awareness","SDG13":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21339","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"'Necessity has made us allies' : the role of coalitions in the climate change negotiations","authors":"Weiler, Florian; Castro Pareja, Paula Mónica","subject":" Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Energie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"333.7, 333.79","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"\"Necessity has made us allies\" : the role of coalitions in the climate change negotiations;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Energie","doc_id":9422,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5745","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Environmental gradients and succession patterns of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in an alpine glacier retreat zone","authors":"Schlegel, Jürg; Riesen, Matthias","subject":"Primary succession; Invertebrate fauna; Swiss alps; Climate change;  Ökologie;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577, 590","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Environmental gradients and succession patterns of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in an alpine glacier retreat zone; Primary succession; Invertebrate fauna; Swiss alps; Climate change;  Ökologie;  Tiere (Zoologie); Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch); Accelerated by global warming, retreating glaciers leave behind spatially ordered moraines with underlying primary succession and disturbance.

Da es sich bei dieser Angelegenheit um eine Thematik mit globaler Reichweite handelt, wird die Debatte von internationalen Organisationen geführt, in erster Linie von den United Nations. Dabei werden Massnahmen und Ziele definiert, die von den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten ratifiziert und anschliessend lokal umgesetzt werden sollen. Die Schweiz hat diesbezüglich spezielle Umsetzungsstrategien für den Finanzmarkt erlassen, der aufgrund seiner Grösse und Finanzstärke eine besondere Rolle einnimmt. Das gilt insbesondere für die Versicherungsindustrie, die mit ihrem umfangreichen Investitionsvolumen die Möglichkeit hat, bestimmte Industrien und Technologien zu fördern und andere durch Desinvestitionen, Einflussnahme per Aktionärsstimmrecht und weitere Optionen zu einer Änderung hin zu einem nachhaltigeren Wirtschaften zu bewegen. Versicherungen haben durch ihr Geschäftsmodell der Risikoübernahme ein besonderes Interesse daran, dass die dem Klimawandel zugesprochenen extremen Wetterereignisse und die daraus resultierenden Schäden möglichst gering ausfallen. Das gelingt nur, wenn die Ursachen gestoppt oder zumindest reduziert werden können. Entsprechend setzt sich die Versicherungsbranche Ziele, die einen Ausstieg aus der Versicherung bzw. Finanzierung von bestimmten CO-intensiven Projekten vorsehen. Im Bereich der Schadenversicherungstätigkeit selbst besteht zurzeit noch ein Mangel an Nachhaltigkeit bzw. an der Förderung nachhaltig ausgerichteter Produkte. Einerseits ist es nicht einfach, dieses Kriterium messbar in Produkte zu integrieren, andererseits spüren die Versicherungsgesellschaften noch keine grosse Nachfrage seitens der Versicherungsnehmenden nach solchen Produkten. Dass sich die Branche jedoch intensiver mit der Thematik beschäftigen und Lösungen finden muss, scheint sicher aufgrund des politischen und gesellschaftlichen Drucks, der bei diesem Thema herrscht und der sich noch erhöhen wird, spätestens dann, wenn sich die Situation nach der Covid--Pandemie wieder normalisiert hat.","doc_id":9757,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"10","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21306","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Call for a definition and paradigm shift in energy performance gap research","authors":"Janser, Marcel; Hubbuch, Markus; Windlinger Inversini, Lukas","subject":"Energy performance gap; Climate performance gap; Practice theory;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"690","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Call for a definition and paradigm shift in energy performance gap research; Energy performance gap; Climate performance gap; Practice theory;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk; There is a growing interest in research dealing with energy performance gaps of buildings.

The authors therefore call for a definition and paradigm shift in energy performance gap research, suggesting two broader definitions of the research subject (called life cycle energy performance gaps and climate performance gaps) and a promising alternative scientific paradigm (practice theory).","doc_id":9972,"prior":"climate action","SDG13":1},{"id":"5","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2518","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The multifunctional aquaponic system at ZHAW used as research and training lab","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Antenen, Nadine; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Education; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"630","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"The multifunctional aquaponic system at ZHAW used as research and training lab; Aquaponics; Education; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft; Aquaponics plays a part in promoting sustainable development on different levels in society, and its use is becoming ever more widespread. However, there are not enough trained specialists yet to build and operate such systems. The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of institutions of higher education – like ZHAW – can play to mitigate this deficit. ZHAW has the ability to execute applied research, teaching on BSc and MSc level, and is aiming to increase societal added value concerning education and health. Each of these levels has different demands on the aquaponic system concerning a multitude of factors, such as access, size, construction, climate control, diversity of production methods, recycling and closed loop systems, provision of energy from renewable sources and rainwater harvesting, treatment and use. To evaluate how these objectives are reached, the requirements on the system originating from each level are defined. These are used to evaluate the aquaponic system that was built and operated at ZHAW. Other aquaponic systems in use are compared to the ZHAW system, using the same evaluation criteria. The results show that the ZHAW Aquaponics Lab can reach all target levels, if the aquaponic farm of its spin-off company UrbanFarmers is viewed as an extension of it.","doc_id":10061,"prior":"climate","posterior":"production","SDG13":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8800","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Evaluation Wirkungsverstärkung Umweltunterricht : 2.

To accelerate this transition, many governments have implemented renewable energy auctions that bank on rapidly falling renewable energy prices. Recently, auction designs have become increasingly “technology-neutral”, meaning that projects based on different technologies, such as solar photovoltaics and wind, compete for the same auction award. Yet, innovation literature suggests that technology-neutral designs may undermine technology diversity—an important element to ensure the security of supply. In a first step, this paper analyses how renewable energy auction design features influence auction outcomes based on a comprehensive and systematic literature review. In a second step, this paper focuses on technology diversity as one important auction outcome. More specifically, it uses a simple levelized cost of electricity model to quantitatively analyse the influence of three selected design features on the cost competitiveness of two technologies, solar photovoltaics and onshore wind. This study shows that the influence of design features on auction outcomes takes various shapes. The findings also suggest that technology-neutral auction designs may affect the cost competitiveness of different technologies in different ways and thus indeed undermine technology diversity. Thus, policymakers need to be aware of potential trade-offs between policy outcomes when designing renewable energy auctions.","doc_id":10610,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"21","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22098","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Hydroponic technologies","authors":"Maucieri, Carmelo; Nicoletto, Carlo; van Os, Erik; Anseeouw, Dieter; Van Havermaet, Robin; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Hydroponics; Soilless culture; Nutrients; Grow medium; Aeroponics; Aquaponics; Nutrient solution;  Aquakultur","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"639.8","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Hydroponic technologies; Hydroponics; Soilless culture; Nutrients; Grow medium; Aeroponics; Aquaponics; Nutrient solution;  Aquakultur; This open access book, written by world experts in aquaponics and related technologies, provides the authoritative and comprehensive overview of the key aquaculture and hydroponic and other integrated systems, socio-economic and environmental aspects.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of temperature extremes on various phenological events of grapevine varieties in Southwest Switzerland (Leytron, Canton of Valais). We aimed to capture the occurrence of extreme events in specific years in various grapevine varieties and at different phenological phases to rank the varieties based on their sensitivity to temperature extremes and thus quantify their robustness. Phenological observations (–) of six Vitis vinifera varieties (Arvine, Chardonnay, Chasselas, Gamay, Pinot noir and Syrah) were subjected to event coincidence analysis. Extreme events were defined as values in the uppermost or lowermost percentiles of the timing of the phenophases and daily temperatures within a -day window before the phenophase event occurred. Significantly more extreme temperature and phenological events occurred in Leytron between  and  than in the earlier years, with the years , ,  and  being remarkable in terms of the number of extreme coincidence events. Moreover, bud development and flowering experienced significantly more extreme coincidence events than other phenophases; however, the occurrence rate of extreme coincidence events was independent of the phenophase. Based on the total number of extreme events, the varieties did not differ in their responses to temperature extremes. Therefore, event coincidence analysis is an appropriate tool to quantify the occurrence of extreme events.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of temperature extremes on various phenological events of grapevine varieties in Southwest Switzerland (Leytron, Canton of Valais). We aimed to capture the occurrence of extreme events in specific years in various grapevine varieties and at different phenological phases to rank the varieties based on their sensitivity to temperature extremes and thus quantify their robustness. Phenological observations (–) of six Vitis vinifera varieties (Arvine, Chardonnay, Chasselas, Gamay, Pinot noir and Syrah) were subjected to event coincidence analysis. Extreme events were defined as values in the uppermost or lowermost percentiles of the timing of the phenophases and daily temperatures within a -day window before the phenophase event occurred. Significantly more extreme temperature and phenological events occurred in Leytron between  and  than in the earlier years, with the years , ,  and  being remarkable in terms of the number of extreme coincidence events. Moreover, bud development and flowering experienced significantly more extreme coincidence events than other phenophases; however, the occurrence rate of extreme coincidence events was independent of the phenophase. Based on the total number of extreme events, the varieties did not differ in their responses to temperature extremes. Therefore, event coincidence analysis is an appropriate tool to quantify the occurrence of extreme events. The occurrence of extreme temperature events clearly affected the advancement of the timings of phenological events in various grapevines. However, there were no varietal differences in terms of response to extreme temperatures; thus, additional research is warranted to outline the best adaptation measures.","doc_id":11465,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15779","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Much ado about nothing?

It has been repeatedly emphasized that SDMs should be evaluated based not only on their goodness of fit to the data, but also on the realism of the modelled ecological responses. However, possibilities for the latter are hampered by limited knowledge on the true responses as well as a lack of quantitative evaluation methods. Here we compared modelled niche optima obtained from European-scale SDMs of , terrestrial vascular plant species with empirical ecological indicator values indicating the preferences of plant species for key environmental conditions. For each plant species we first fitted an ensemble SDM including three modeling techniques (GLM, GAM and BRT) and extracted niche optima for climate, soil, land use and nitrogen deposition variables with a large explanatory power for the occurrence of that species. We then compared these SDM-derived niche optima with the ecological indicator values by means of bivariate correlation analysis. We found weak to moderate correlations in the expected direction between the SDM-derived niche optima and ecological indicator values. The strongest correlation occurred between the modelled optima for growing degree days and the ecological indicator values for temperature. Correlations were weaker for SDM-derived niche optima with a more distal relationship to ecological indicator values (notably precipitation and soil moisture). Further, correlations were consistently highest for BRT, followed by GLM and GAM. Our method gives insight into the ecological realism of modelled niche optima and projected core habitats and can be used to improve SDMs by making a more informed selection of environmental variables and modeling techniques.","doc_id":11500,"prior":"climate","posterior":"land use","SDG13":1},{"id":"59","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19317","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Buffering volatility : storage investments and technology-specific renewable energy support","authors":"Abrell, Jan; Rausch, Sebastian; Streitberger, Clemens","subject":"Energy policy; Technology-specific regulation; Volatility; Renewable energy;  Energie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.79","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Buffering volatility : storage investments and technology-specific renewable energy support; Energy policy; Technology-specific regulation; Volatility; Renewable energy;  Energie; Mitigating climate change will require integrating large amounts of highly intermittent renewable energy (RE) sources in future electricity markets.

These most speciesrich habitats are threatened due to intensification of agriculture, eutrophication, dereliction, climate change and landscape fragmentation. As a result, the vegetation of semi‐dry grasslands is changing and shows a trend towards homogenization. Specialized species are particularly endangered because their growth conditions are no longer met due to eutrophication and fragmentation. However, only a few studies have so far found that nutrient enrichment also leads to a decline in the species richness. Especially in the calcareous region of the Swiss Jura, the state of knowledge regarding the impact of eutrophication on semi‐dry grasslands is still poor. By performing a resurvey, it has been investigated whether the vegetation change in this region is in line with the general trend in Western Europe. Abundance, species diversity,  different ecological indicator, four functional traits, diagnostic species were analyzed. A habitat classification and decentered correspondence analysis were also performed. Species diversity, light availability, temperature, seed dispersal by animals and seed persistence are all ecological indicator values that have significantly decreased in . Conversely, nutrient availability, soil moisture, seed mass, specific leaf area and canopy height have increased. There are significantly fewer ruderal species, stress‐tolerant species, therophytes and herbaceous chamaephytes in . Highly competitive species and hemicryptophytes, on the contrary, have increased. The general observation shows an increase in productivity and is due to eutrophication of the sites. There are fewer specialized species than in , indicating a homogenization of the vegetation composition, which is shifting towards nutrient‐rich pasture and meadows. A slight increase of the vegetation of the mesophilous herbaceous shrub was also observed. This shift towards their natural successional stage and the eutrophication shows that agricultural management is not optimally carried out. Most of these sites are still not supported by any conservation program. The fact that the results slightly differ from the general trend in Western Europe is also an indication of the importance of promoting regionally targeted conservation strategy in order to stop biodiversity loss in semi‐dry grasslands.","doc_id":13639,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9489","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Transitions in the negotiations on climate change : from prisoner’s dilemma to chicken and beyond","authors":"Pittel, Karen; Rübbelke, Dirk T.

Located at an elevation of about  m a.s.l. on the steep south-facing slopes above the Rhone valley, one of the most continental inneralpine dry valleys, it has a pronounced dry climate ( mm annual precipitation) and hot summers. This situation led to the development of rather extensive steppic grasslands with their often rare and sometimes even endemic flora and fauna. These grasslands are embedded into a matrix of other elements of xerothermic vegetation complexes, which makes the slopes of this village overall very species rich and creates a beautiful landscape.The special physical geographical situation is complemented by a long cultural history. First mentioned in , the village was reachable via mule track only for a long time. Only in the early th century it got a railway station at the newly built Lötschberg line and even later a road to Visp in the Rhone valley.

Data from the German Income and Expenditure Survey (EVS) is applied to the EEG surcharge to show its effect on different household types. We show that those groups with the largest consumption of electricity often face the smallest relative burden due to the EEG surcharge, as they can compensate with their relatively large income. Groups with little discretionary income, such as low-income households, the unemployed and single parents face the highest relative burden, although the amounts they consume are not large in absolute terms. In light of our findings, we review the provisions relating to energy expenditures in the German social security system. We then go on to examine the main energy efficiency policies that are implemented and planned in Germany relating to buildings and electricity consumption/appliances. Results indicate that those policies do have the potential to reduce the burden imposed by the EEG surcharge. Furthermore, the combined effect of the EEG surcharge and those policies turns out to be nearly proportional. On the one hand, this shows that energy efficiency measures are not only relevant climate and energy policy instruments, but can also serve distributional goals. On the other hand, we highlight that the result regarding their positive distributional effects only holds if indeed these measures are taken up also by low-income households.

In the Palaearctic biogeographic realm, natural and secondary grasslands (% and % of all grasslands, respectively) cover about . million km, i.e., % of its territory, which constitute % of global grasslands—more than any other biogeographic realm. In “The encyclopedia of the world’s biomes,” the Palaearctic grasslands are placed in the section “Grasslands and shrublands,” where we defined  regions, which are treated in individual chapters: Western Europe,Northern Europe and Baltic States, Eastern Europe, Mediterranean Region, Middle East and Caucasus, Russia, Kazakhstan and Middle Asia, Mongolia, China, and Japan. These regions cover the huge majority of the realm and about % of its grasslands. Each chapter describes the extent, physiogeography, origin, biodiversity and typology of the grasslands in the region, the threats for grassland diversity and extent, as well as grassland management and conservation. Grasslands are important habitats for many groups of taxa. Dry calcareous grasslands and steppes constitute habitat of most of Europe’s butterfly and Orthoptera species, and they host significant number of European endemic plants. In small spatial scales (i.e., below  m) Palaearctic grasslands, especially meso-xeric ones, can hold even higher species diversity of plants than tropical rainforests. However, Palaearctic grasslands are also among the most intensively and negatively human-impacted habitats. Changes in grassland management, like overgrazing or other types of intensification as well as abandonment were assessed as the most important recent and future threats. Other important reasons of decline in grassland diversity are habitat loss and altered site conditions. The negative impact of climate change and invasive species is predicted to be stronger in the future. In the last years, various conservation efforts to monitor, maintain and promote grassland extent and diversity were made. However, to counteract the negative trends, these efforts urgently need to be intensified and their efficiency needs to be improved.","doc_id":14638,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23863","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Vermarktung von nachhaltigen Technologien","authors":"Weber, Matthias","subject":" Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"338.927, 658.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Vermarktung von nachhaltigen Technologien;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Marketingmanagement; Die Nachfrage nach nachhaltigen Technologien wächst stetig.

Bayesian statistics is a consistent framework for parameter inference where knowledge about model parameters is expressed through probability distributions and updated using measured data. However, Bayesian inference with non-trivial stochastic models can become computationally extremely expensive and it is therefore hardly ever applied. In recent years, sophisticated and scalable algorithms have emerged, which have the potential of making Bayesian inference for complex stochastic models feasible, even for very large data sets. We present here the power of both Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms through a case study in solar physics. Time-series of cosmogenic radionuclides in wood and polar ice cores are a proxy for solar activity on multi-millennial time-scales and exhibit a number of interesting and mostly not-yet-understood features such as stable cycles, Grand Minima and intermittency. Solar physicists have put a lot of effort into the development of stochastic solar dynamo models, which need to be calibrated to the observations. Parameter inference for stochastic dynamo models on long time-series of radionuclides is an open and highly topical question in solar physics.

Transitioning to electricity systems that are considered acceptable by the public requires that the public's preferences be taken into account. In this study, we investigate the type of energy technology portfolio that people prefer for Switzerland, and why they prefer it, when they are faced with two realistic constraints: (i) the limited domestic potential for the expansion of power plants and (ii) the requirement to not dismantle existing infrastructure. We find that the affect evoked by particular energy technologies is consistently the most important driver of the proportion of those technologies included in an energy portfolio. The regression models for the investigated technologies explain between % and % of the variance, providing strong support for the affect heuristic. We further find that concerns regarding environmental impacts, costs or climate change play an additional role for portfolio preferences. This is reflected in four different clusters we identified for the German-speaking Swiss population who potentially hold opposing views as to what they consider the best electricity mix. For policymakers, our findings suggest that positive affective reactions towards energy technologies are necessary, although concerns must also be considered if the implementation is to be widely accepted.","doc_id":15645,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24364","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Direct Air Capture Technologien – sind sie die Zukunft?","authors":"Becker, Kai","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"363, 620","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Direct Air Capture Technologien – sind sie die Zukunft?;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Ingenieurwesen; Dass der Klimawandel ein ernstes Problem darstellt und die CO-Konzentration in der Luft verringert werden muss, darüber ist sich die Wissenschaft einig. Während in der vorindustriellen Zeit die CO-Konzentration in der Luft bei  ppm lag, stieg sie bis  auf  ppm an. Daher wurden Beschlüsse wie das Kyoto Protokoll oder das Pariser Klimaabkommen getroffen. In Letzterem hat man sich nun geeinigt hat, den Temperaturanstieg bis Ende des Jahrhunderts auf deutlich unter °C zu beschränken. Wie man dieses Ziel jedoch erreicht, ist immer noch mit sehr vielen Unklarheiten verbunden. Es gibt unzählige Möglichkeiten und Technologien und für jede Lösung Befürworter und Gegner. Eine dieser Möglichkeiten ist Direct Air Capture, auch DAC genannt. Diese noch junge Technologie wurde erstmals  erwähnt, gewann jedoch erst ab  so richtig an Bedeutung. Nun stellen sich Wissenschaftler und Politiker die Frage, ob und wie DAC eine Rolle spielen wird. Diese Arbeit untersucht, welche Faktoren die Zukunft von DAC massgeblich beeinflussen und welche Bedingungen in naher bis mittlerer Zukunft bestehen müssen, damit DAC einen relevanten Beitrag zur Bekämpfung des Klimawandels leisten kann. Nach einer ausgiebigen Literaturrecherche, bei welcher  Studien analysiert wurden, konnten  Faktoren identifiziert und mittels Experteninterviews validiert werden. Aufgrund der quantitativen Analyse der Daten konnte bestimmt werden, dass der Strommix, die variablen Kosten, die Fixkosten, technologische Verbesserungen durch R&D sowie die Anzahl an gebauten DAC-Anlagen die Faktoren sind, welchen die Wissenschaft zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt die stärksten Auswirkungen zuschreibt und welche am häufigsten genannt werden. Mithilfe eines Backcasting-Ansatzes konnte daraufhin synthetisiert werden, dass die Politik, die Wirtschaft mit Abnehmermärkten für gefangenes CO sowie private Investoren, wie z.B. Apple, Microsoft oder Tesla, die wichtigsten Treiber sind. Diese werden mit ihren Aktionen in naher Zukunft massgeblich entscheiden, ob und wie sich DAC als eine Lösung, um den Klimawandel zu stoppen, durchsetzen wird. Final konnten die Faktoren und Treiber mittels Experteninterviews validiert werden. Dabei konnte festgestellt werden, dass die Politik und die privaten Investoren mit Abstand die wichtigsten Bedingungen darstellen, während die Wirtschaft der DAC-Technologie zwar einen ökonomischen Anreiz verschafft, diese aber wahrscheinlich kein wegweisender Treiber sein wird. Des Weiteren konnte bestimmt werden, dass DAC am besten nicht als eine alleinige Lösung für die Reduktion der CO-Konzentration in der Luft eingesetzt wird, sondern vielmehr in einem breiten Mix aus Technologien und Strategien angewendet wird. Aufgrund dieser Ergebnisse wird es als wichtig angesehen, dass in Zukunft untersucht wird, wie die Politik ein globales Handelssystem für negativ Emissionen aufbauen kann und wie die Rahmenbedingungen dafür aussehen sollten. Zudem sollten mehr Integrated-Assessment-Models, welche DAC als Lösung beinhalten, durchgeführt werden, um besser verstehen zu können, wie DAC am besten eingesetzt und welche Auswirkungen es haben wird.","doc_id":15934,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22661","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Swiss mobility transformation to sustainability : recommendations on niche developments","authors":"Hoerler, Raphael; Tomic, Uros; Del Duce, Andrea","subject":"Transformation; Sustainable mobility; Lifestyles; Electric vehicle; Carsharing; MaaS; Autonomous driving; Multi-level perspective;  Verkehr","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"380","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Swiss mobility transformation to sustainability : recommendations on niche developments; Transformation; Sustainable mobility; Lifestyles; Electric vehicle; Carsharing; MaaS; Autonomous driving; Multi-level perspective;  Verkehr; One of the biggest challenges for mankind is the imminent climate crisis, if global warming exceeds two degrees by the end of this century.

Diese Strategie beinhaltet hauptsächlich den Ersatz des Stroms aus stillgelegten Kernkraftwerken. Nicht berücksichtigt wurde dabei die bis spätestens  notwendige Dekarbonisierung des Energiesystems, um die Ziele des Abkommens von Paris einhalten zu können. Der dazu erforderliche Ersatz fossiler Brennstoffe wird zu einer starken Zunahme des Strombedarfes führen. In diesem Bericht wird deshalb der Bedarf an Stromimporten gemäss der Energiestrategie  aufgezeigt und darauf aufbauend die zusätzlichen Folgen für den Stromimport und die Versorgungssicherheit bei einer Dekarbonisierung des Energiesystems bis  diskutiert.Die Schweiz importiert in den Wintermonaten aktuell etwa  bis  TWh Strom. Durch die Abschaltung von Atomkraftwerken, den zunehmenden Einsatz von Wärmepumpensystemen zur Heizung von Gebäuden und den Übergang zur Elektromobilität wird sich dieser Importbedarf in den nächsten  Jahren trotz Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien gemäss den Zielsetzungen der Energiestrategie noch stark erhöhen. Ohne Berücksichtigung von Flugtreibstoffen wird der Strombedarf der Schweiz um etwa % und das Produktionsdefizit im Winter in der Folge von heute . TWh auf schätzungsweise  TWh pro Jahr ansteigen. Der geplante Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien wird aber auch im Sommerhalb-jahr nicht mehr zur Deckung des Strombedarfes reichen.Die meisten umliegenden Länder erwarten nach Abschaltung der Kohle- und Atomkraftwerke ebenfalls einen Importbedarf von Strom im Winter. Es ist somit unklar, ob auch in Zukunft im Winter genug Strom importiert werden kann. Für die Versorgungssicherheit und die Wertschöpfung wäre es deshalb für die Schweiz wünschenswert, einen möglichst grossen Anteil ihres Strombedarfs selbst produzieren zu können.Das mit Abstand grösste Potential der erneuerbaren Energien weist in der Schweiz die Photovoltaik auf. Mit den gesetzten Ausbauzielen wird dieses Potential bei weitem nicht ausgeschöpft. Gemäss den bisherigen Standpunkten sollen Photovoltaik-Anlagen ausschliesslich auf Gebäuden und evtl. auf weiteren bestehenden Infrastrukturen gebaut werden. Die intermittierende Produktion kann mit Gebäude-integrierten Batteriespeichern, Nutzung von Batterien in Elektromobilen und insbesondere den Pumpspeicherkraftwerken auf Tages- und Wochenbasis gut dem effektiven Bedarf angepasst werden.Mit Power-to-Gas ist eine Technologie zur Umwandlung von nicht zeitgleich nutzbarem Strom in Was-serstoff oder Methan verfügbar. Das Gas steht danach zur sofortigen Verwendung, zum Beispiel in der Industrie oder Mobilität, oder zur saisonalen Speicherung zur Verfügung. Die Rückverstromung dieses Gases ist zwar technisch ebenfalls möglich, aber energetisch ineffizient und sehr teuer. Studien zeigen, dass die saisonale Speicherung mit Power-to-Gas erst bei einem Anteil von Wind- und PV-Strom von mehr als % des Strombedarfes sinnvoll ist. Beim geplanten Ausbautempo von Wind- und Photovol-taik in der Schweiz wird kein Strom für eine saisonale Speicherung mit Power-to-Gas zur Verfügung stehen.Um ihre Verpflichtungen zur Begrenzung des Klimawandels wahrnehmen zu können, muss die Schweiz rasch handeln. Der mit Abstand grösste Handlungsbedarf besteht derzeit in der Schweiz bei der effizienten Nutzung von Energie und beim verstärkten Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energieproduktion. Aus wirtschaftlicher Sicht lohnt sich insbesondere die weitere Verfolgung von Technologien, wie z.B. Windenergie oder Photovoltaik in den Alpen, welche überwiegend im Winter Strom produzieren und keine saisonale Speicherung benötigen.","doc_id":16876,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6036","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Favouring behavioural change of household’s energy consumption through social media and cooperative play","authors":"Castri, Roberta; De Luca, Vanessa; Lobsiger-Kägi, Evelyn; Moser, Corinne; Carabias, Vicente","subject":" Energie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"333.79","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Favouring behavioural change of household’s energy consumption through social media and cooperative play;  Energie; A change in how individuals consume energy is a key step in fighting climate change since it represents a crucial contribution to a more collective and sustainable lifestyle adoption.

A large amount of detailed information is available on the use and differences of rating and certification systems. For stakeholders in the energy market sector, however, it is important to have the necessary information available on energy monitoring data and GHG (greenhouse gas) emission reporting for value creation. One promising concept is the -Watt-Area. A -Watt-Area (WA) is a new form of settlement. It has achieved a reputation for energy efficiency, renewable energies and climate friendliness and reflects the values of a responsible society. In this work we try to find answers to the following questions:· Which evaluation criteria are the basis for the WA?· How much can these urban areas lower their GHG emissions?· What role do the instruments of energy efficiency and renewable energies play in this?· What is the relationship between these and what statements can be made with regard to mobility?· How can the Facility Manager help to transform successfully into WA?The paper is based on literature research and three interviews with stakeholders in the Swiss construction sector (a district representative, an energy consultant, a technology provider). The findings qualify the concept of WA and put it into a wider international context of certification and benchmarking systems. It was found that  WA are in operation, implementation and transition in Switzerland. From the experience gained from these districts it can be seen that the WA concept is trying to include important aspects of a sustainable transition of districts. While many districts were new developments (), only  were districts in transformation. The number of districts in transformation need to increase considerably if the GHG emission reduction goals in Switzerland are to be met. Facility managers can play an important role in this transition. But they need to enhance their skills and responsibilities in order to fulfil their roles as transition managers. Evaluating the WA can be a key to this and has the potential to enhance the reduction of GHG emissions in districts and cities.","doc_id":17367,"prior":"climate","posterior":"emissions","SDG13":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22890","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Ökologische Aufwertung im urbanen Raum","authors":"Morell, Andri","subject":"Animal Aided Design; Living Architecture; Ecological Design; Ökologische Vernetzung; Sustainable Construction;  Ökologie;  Architektur","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"577, 720","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Ökologische Aufwertung im urbanen Raum; Animal Aided Design; Living Architecture; Ecological Design; Ökologische Vernetzung; Sustainable Construction;  Ökologie;  Architektur; Die Infrastrukturflächen, auf denen Gebäude oder Strassen stehen, wachsen täglich.

It has been generally recognized that inadequate consideration of reservoir sedimentation has caused the worldwide decline of net storage. Numerical models are useful tools to simulate sedimentation processes and can be used to derive efficient counter-measures and sediment management strategies. They can be applied to both existing and potential future reservoirs to predict long-term sedimentation. In this study, an application of a simple, robust, and stable numerical D model to Gebidem reservoir in Switzerland accompanied by field measurements is presented. It focusses on seasonal and large-scale reservoir sedimentation processes that occur continuously throughout the whole deposition season, while episodic events like turbidity currents are not taken into account. The model simulates both the delta formation of coarse sediments and the lake-wide sedimentation from homopycnal flows. The model is used to assess the effects and significance of varying boundary conditions like inflow, suspended sediment concentration, particle size distribution (PSD), or reservoir operation. It will be demonstrated that future reservoir operation and PSD are as important as future runoff evolution. Based on these findings, implications on future reservoir operation, also considering climate change, are discussed.

This is due to the fact that impact investing offers an opportunity for investors to generate a positive, social and environmental impact while still reaching their financial goals. A lot of research and literature is available on measuring and managing impact.

The goal of this master thesis is to develop recommendations for impact investors on how to evaluate the impact of agro-food start-ups, in order to select suitable and impact-full investees. A qualitative study was conducted on how impact investors and experts in the field carry out impact evaluations in the agro-food sector and for start-ups. From this research,  hypotheses and  recommendations were deduced, and they were used to develop a framework for the impact evaluation of agro-food start-ups. The framework proposes the following four-phased evaluation method. Prior to the impact evaluations, investors are asked to identify their own impact missions.

Während Start-ups die nötige Innovationskraft mitbringen, um eine Systemveränderung auszulösen, fehlt ihnen häufig das dafür notwendige Kapital. Impact Investing hat das Potenzial diese Finanzierungslücke zu schliessen. Denn Impact Investing bietet eine Möglichkeit für Investor*innen einen positiven, sozialen und ökologischen Impact für die Gesellschaft zu generieren und gleichzeitig einen finanziellen Ertrag zu erzielen. Es ist bereits viel Forschung und Literatur vorhanden zur Messung und zum Management von Impact. Die Forschung und vorhandenen standardisierten Frameworks sind jedoch nur für die Bewertung von etablierten Unternehmen intendiert. Für die Bewertung des Impacts von Start-ups sind diese allerdings aufgrund der fehlenden Unternehmensdaten und entwicklungsbedingten Unsicherheiten nicht anwendbar. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es eine Empfehlung für die Impact Beurteilung von Agrofood Start-ups für Impact Investor*innen abzugeben, damit sie passende und Impact-volle Start-ups für ein Investment auswählen können. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde zuerst untersucht, wie Impact Investor*innen und Expert*innen Impact Beurteilungen in der Agrofood Branche und bei Start-ups durchführen. Daraus konnten  Hypothesen und  Empfehlungen herausgearbeitet werden, welche die Basis für die Entwicklung eines Frameworks für die Impact Beurteilung von Agrofood Start-ups legten. Das Framework schlägt eine vier-phasige Impact Beurteilungsmethode vor. Vorgängig zur Impact Beurteilung sollten Investor*innen allerdings ihre eigene Impact Mission identifizieren. Die Impact Beurteilungsmethode beginnt mit einem Initial Screen (Phase ), in welchem der Impact Mission Fit überprüft wird, gewisse ESG-Risiken ausgeschlossen werden und die Skalierbarkeit und Innovationskraft des Start-ups eingeschätzt wird. Nach dieser ersten Auswahlphase, folgt eine detaillierte Impact Prüfung (Due Diligence, Phase ), aufbauend auf den fünf Dimensionen des Impact Management Project (IMP, ), um die Theory of Change des Investees zu erarbeiten. Für die Due Diligence werden Agrofood- und Start-up-spezifische, primär qualitative und deskriptive Indikatoren vorgeschlagen. Diese wurden auf Basis der sechs Impact Themen des CISL (), den IRIS+ Metrics (GIIN, b) und den SAFA Guidelines (FAO, ) erarbeitet, mit dem Ziel alle relevanten Impact Aspekte in der Agrofood Branche abzudecken. Im Anschluss zum Investment Proposal (Phase ) werden Impact Investor*innen angehalten ein quantitatives Impact Monitoring gemeinsam mit dem Investee aufzusetzen und die Zielerreichung regelmässig zu überprüfen (Phase ). Das Framework soll Impact Investor*innen mit Interesse in Agrofood Start-ups bei Impact Beurteilung unterstützen. Es ist darauf ausgelegt die persönlichen Bedürfnisse und Interessen der Investor*innen zu berücksichtigen und gleichzeitig das Auftreten von negativen Nebeneffekten zu minimieren. Gleichzeitig soll die Impact Beurteilung keinen unnützen Mehraufwand für Start-ups darstellen, sondern ihre Entwicklung bezüglich Impact unterstützen und eine Zusammenarbeit mit ihren Investor*innen begünstigen. Investor*innen werden dazu angehalten, das Framework kritisch zu hinterfragen und gemäss ihren Zielen und Bedürfnissen anzupassen. Das Framework hat nicht den Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit und wurde im Rahmen dieser Masterarbeit nicht in der Praxis geprüft.; The agro-food sector is being confronted with many major global challenges, such as malnutrition, growing world population and a changing climate.

This is unfortunate, as the potential for a broader societal impact through claims is significant.There are several best practices for transforming organizations to deliver more value along corporate responsibility criteria, and insurance companies need to make treasure of this experience.

Diese Arbeit befasst sich mit der Entwicklung des Stadtbaumdeckungsgrades in Schweizer Städten. Sie erfasst die aktuelle Situation, zeigt den Nutzen von Stadtbäumen auf und diskutiert die Entwicklung. Die Resultate zeigen, dass generell ein Rückgang des Baumdeckungsgrades stattfindet. Zeitgleich nimmt die versiegelte Fläche zu. Beschleunigt durch den Klimawandel werden die Folgen des Rückganges spürbarer. Die Städte werden vermehrt zu Hitzeinseln, in denen die Lebensqualität und die Vitalität der Stadtökosysteme zumindest gebietsweise abnimmt. Ein Rückgang heisst zugleich ein Verlust an Ökosystemdienstleistungen, welche Stadtbäume für die Bewohner und Bewohnerinnen sowie die Flora und Fauna der Stadt generieren. Es besteht daher ein dringender Handlungsbedarf und die Stadtplanung ist gezwungen, Massnahmen zu ergreifen. Zum einen um die Lebensqualität für Mensch und Natur zu gewährleisten und zum andern, um die Folgen des Klimawandels zu mindern. Basiert auf den Resultaten kann die Massnahme der Gesetzgebung zum Schutz des Baumbestandes, als erfolgreich nachgewiesen werden.

Until you will find one, you may have to walk a long way through the \"grey deserts\" in the future. This thesis deals with the development of urban tree cover in Swiss cities. It records the current situation of development, shows the benefits of urban trees and discusses the problems. The results show that there is a general decline in the degree of tree cover. At the same time the sealed surface is increasing. Accelerated by the global warming, the consequences of the decline are becoming more noticeable. Cities are becoming more an more heat islands, where the quality of life and the vitality of urban eco-systems is slowly declining. A decline also means a loss of ecosystem services that urban trees generate for the inhabitants and the flora and fauna of the city. There is a need for action and cities are forced to take measures. On the one hand, to ensure the quality of life for people and nature and, on the other, to detract global warming. Based on the resultes the measure to define a law to protect the tree cover can be proven to be successful. A comparison with a current American study also makes it possible to classify the extent of the development in Switzerland. The literature of this thesis should emphasize the importance of our urban trees and promote their appreciation in public and private residential areas. Only in this way is it possible to achieve success for the entire urban system.","doc_id":17878,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16539","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Combining price and quantity controls under partitioned environmental regulation","authors":"Abrell, Jan; Rausch, Sebastian","subject":"Emission Trading; Emission uncertainty; Hybrid regulation; Partitioned environmental regulation;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Combining price and quantity controls under partitioned environmental regulation; Emission Trading; Emission uncertainty; Hybrid regulation; Partitioned environmental regulation;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; This paper analyzes hybrid emissions trading systems (ETSs) under partitioned environmental regulation when firms' abatement costs and future emissions are uncertain.

Community phylogenetic structure reflects the relationship of historical processes, regional environments, and interactions between species, and studying it is imperative to understand the formation and maintenance mechanisms of community composition and biodiversity. We studied the phylogenetic structure of the shrub communities in arid and semiarid areas of the Mongolian Plateau. First, the phylogenetic signals of four plant traits (height, canopy, leaf length, and leaf width) of shrubs and subshrubs were measured to determine the phylogenetic conservation of these traits. Then, the net relatedness index (NRI) of shrub communities was calculated to characterize their phylogenetic structure. Finally, the relationship between the NRI and current climate and paleoclimate (since the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM) factors was analyzed to understand the formation and maintenance mechanisms of these plant communities. We found that desert shrub communities showed a trend toward phylogenetic overdispersion; that is, limiting similarity was predominant in arid and semiarid areas of the Mongolian Plateau despite the phylogenetic structure and formation mechanisms differing across habitats. The typical desert and sandy shrub communities showed a significant phylogenetic overdispersion, while the steppified desert shrub communities showed a weak phylogenetic clustering. It was found that mean winter temperature (i.e., in the driest quarter) was the major factor limiting steppified desert shrub phylogeny distribution. Both cold and drought (despite having opposite consequences) differentiated the typical desert to steppified desert shrub communities. The increase in temperature since the LGM is conducive to the invasion of shrub plants into steppe grassland, and this process may be intensified by global warming.","doc_id":18088,"prior":"climate","posterior":"warming","SDG13":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7059","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Besiedlungsdynamik in Primärsukzessionsflächen : Wirbellosen-Fauna im Gletschervorfeld Morteratsch","authors":"Schlegel, Jürg","subject":" Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"590","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Besiedlungsdynamik in Primärsukzessionsflächen : Wirbellosen-Fauna im Gletschervorfeld Morteratsch;  Tiere (Zoologie); Gletschervorfelder sind eisfreie Flächen, die durch den Rückzug der Gletscher seit Mitte des .

The magnitude of the solar irradiance variability strongly depends on the wavelength, making difficult its representation in climate models. Due to some deficiencies in the applied radiation codes, several models fail to show a clear response in middle stratospheric heating rates to solar spectral irradiance variability; therefore, it is important to evaluate model performance in this respect before doing multiple runs. In this work we evaluate the performance of three generations of ECHAM (,  and ) solar radiation schemes by a comparison with the reference high-resolution libRadtran code. We found that all original ECHAM radiation codes miss almost all solar signals in the heating rates in the mesosphere.

In situ respiration (R) was measured and ETSA/R ratios calculated to examine differences in exploitation intensity of the overall respiratory capacity among floodplain habitats and seasons. ETSA and R provided potential and actual estimates, respectively, of organic matter mineralization in the different floodplain habitats.

Comment expliquer que parmi les sympathisants de tels courants doctrinaires, certains jeunes prennent part à des attaques violentes? Ces deux questions constituent le fil conducteur de l’étude de Thomas Gabriel, de l’Université de Zurich, consacrée à l’influence du milieu familial et de l’éducation sur l’assimilation de théories d’extrême droite (Familienerziehung und Rechtsextremismus). L’enquête, menée dans le cadre du Programme national de recherche + «Extrémisme de droite – causes et contre-mesures», s’est conclue au printemps dernier. Elle nous livre à présent ses résultats.L’auteur s’est penché sur l’influence de la famille (parents, mais aussi grands-parents) et de personnes de référence significatives de l’environnement social des jeunes sur l’assimilation de discours d’extrême droite et, notamment, sur le développement d’attitudes et de comportements racistes. Il s’agissait en particulier de mettre en lumière des «itinéraires de développement» dans le parcours des jeunes concernés. Un autre axe important des travaux était l’étude des mécanismes de transmission des idéologies xénophobes entre les générations.Au total,  jeunes (six jeunes femmes et  jeunes hommes d’une moyenne d’âge de  ans sympathisant avec des idées politiques d’extrême droite et susceptibles de participer à des actes violents) ont été interrogés sur le climat émotionnel et affectif au sein de la famille, la manière de gérer les conflits, le style d’éducation et la qualité des relations interfamiliales. L’examen de ces divers éléments a permis à l’équipe de chercheurs de reconstituer les processus biographiques de ces jeunes adultes et d’analyser des «charnières» déterminantes dans leur trajet individuel, celles-là mêmes qui les ont conduits à assimiler ce type d’idéologies. A cet égard, il convient de noter que ces «charnières» n’ont pas été seulement mises en évidence par les chercheurs: les jeunes interviewés ont eux aussi qualifié des événements biographiques particuliers comme décisifs dans le développement d’attitudes et de comportements racistes. Près de la moitié des jeunes interrogés étaient membres d’une organisation d’extrême droite (Partei National Orientierter Schweiz [PNOS], Schweizer Nationalisten, Helvetische Jugend, Démocrates Suisses [DS], Blood & Honour, Hammerskins) et environ deux tiers d’entre eux faisaient état de leur appartenance à un groupuscule du type hooligans, skinheads et skingirls. Les auteurs se sont en outre entretenus avec sept couples de parents, des grands-parents et d’autres adultes de référence de l’environnement social et familial des jeunes. Présentation succincte des principaux résultats. On peut affirmer d’emblée que ni les jeunes sondés ni leur famille ne peuvent être considérés comme des «laissés-pour-compte du progrès», («Modernisierungsverlierer») des victimes de l’évolution sociale et économique. Les  cas étudiés  se caractérisent par une grande «normalité» dans les modes et les projets de vie mis en oeuvre. Tant les jeunes que leur famille peuvent être qualifiés de bien intégrés.En revanche, la violence domestique, conjuguée aux conséquences des conflits opposant les parents, joue un rôle majeur dans l’adhésion à des schémas idéologiques d’extrême droite. Les chercheurs ont été surpris de constater qu’un grand nombre de ces jeunes adultes bénéficiaient de mesures d’assistance à la jeunesse. Ainsi, la famille et l’environnement social, de même que la culture et l’histoire individuelles sont autant de facteurs capitaux dans le développement d’attitudes et de comportements racistes. Bien que la prise de contact avec les milieux d’extrême droite soit plutôt le fruit du hasard, l’importance que revêtent ces rencontres pour les jeunes concernés n’a rien d’une coïncidence: elle est en effet déterminée par leur histoire personnelle. Les processus biographiques décrits dans l’étude fournissent de précieux renseignements sur les motifs qui incitent un jeune à faire siennes des idéologies xénophobes ou à participer à des attaques violentes à caractère raciste. Ils permettent également de mieux comprendre pour quelles raisons d’autres jeunes, vivant dans des conditions sociales semblables, ne sont guère sensibles à ce genre de discours. Sur la base des nombreuses données recueillies, les chercheurs distinguent trois types de modèles familiaux et de processus biographiques de nature à favoriser, d’une part, le développement de sympathies pour les milieux d’extrême droite et, d’autre part, la participation à des actes de violence. Les trois schémas directeurs se caractérisent comme suit:– Démarcation via une «suradaptation» – radicalisation des normes et des valeurs transmises par le milieu d’origine– Expression de la violence et du mépris dans la quête de reconnaissance– Absence de considération, recherche d’expériences et d’assurance, volonté d’afficher sa différence.","doc_id":19493,"prior":"climat","posterior":"cadre","SDG13":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22891","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Erfolgskontrolle : Ausstiegshilfen für Amphibien aus Entwässerungsschächten","authors":"Morgenthaler, Lara","subject":"Ausstieghilfen; Amphibien; Schutzmassnahmen; Entwässerungssystem; Bufo bufo; Rana temporaria; Ichthyosaura alpestris; Erfolgskontrolle;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333, 590","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Erfolgskontrolle : Ausstiegshilfen für Amphibien aus Entwässerungsschächten; Ausstieghilfen; Amphibien; Schutzmassnahmen; Entwässerungssystem; Bufo bufo; Rana temporaria; Ichthyosaura alpestris; Erfolgskontrolle;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie); Die Amphibienbestände in der Schweiz stehen immer mehr unter Druck. So sind  der  einheimischen Arten stark gefährdet. Viele Amphibienarten sind durch ihren natürlichen Jahreszyklus gezwungen, mehrmals pro Jahr weite Wanderungen auf sich zu nehmen. Dabei sehen sich die Tiere verschiedenen Gefahren ausgesetzt. Da Randsteine nicht überklettert werden können, übernehmen sie eine Leitfunktion und führen Tiere direkt zu Entwässerungsschächten. Durch das dunkle und feuchte Klima haben die Schächte eine grosse Fallenwirkung.Um dem Bestandsrückgang der einheimischen Amphibien entgegenzuwirken soll im Bereich der Siedlungsentwässerung der Amphibienschutz Massnahmen wie die Installation von Ausstiegshilfen in bereits vorhanden Abwasserschächten umsetzen. Es bestehen verschiedene Systeme, die sich gezielt für die Installation in Entwässerungs-schächten eignen (z.B. Terramatte, Amphibienleiter, Ausstiegsrohr).Im Rahmen eines Pilotprojekts vom Naturschutzverein Illnau-Effretikon wurden mehre Abwasserschächte mit Ausstiegshilfen ausgestattet. Dazu wurden aus den über  Entwässerungsschächten der Gemeinde  Schächte an Problemstellen ausgewählt.Ziel der Arbeit ist es, festzustellen, wie hoch die Akzeptanz der Ausstiegshilfen der Tiere ist und ob ein Unterschied zwischen den Arten erkennbar ist. Im Weiteren soll eruiert werden, wo allenfalls Verbesserungspotential besteht.Die Feldarbeit wurde vom . Februar bis . Juni durchgeführt. Dabei wurden die Ausstiegshilfen, auf ihre Wirkung geprüft. Als Erfolg gilt das selbständige Entkommen eines Tieres aus einem Entwässerungsschacht. Kontrolliert wurden Erfolg mittels regelmässiger Kontrollgänge, bei welchen die Schächte nach Tieren abgesucht wurden.Insgesamt wurden während der Erfolgskontrolle  Tiere in den Abwasserschächten gefunden. Erfasst wurden  Grasfrösche,  Erdkröten und  Bergmolche. Der limitierte Datensatz schmälert die Aussagekraft der Erfolgskontrolle. Ein Faktor, der das Aufkommen von Amphibien in der Region geschmälert haben könnte, ist eine natürliche Populationsschwankung oder ein eher früher Start der Amphibienwanderung durch die wärmeren Temperaturen im Februar . Bei  Tieren des Gesamttotals wird davon ausgegangen, dass sie dank den Ausstiegshilfen selbständig aus den Schächten entkommen konnten, die wahrscheinliche Erfolgsquote liegt also bei %. Knapp der Hälfte der Tiere ist das selbständige Entkommen aus dem Schacht bereits nach  Stunden gelungen.Wichtig ist es, die getroffenen Massnahmen auf ihre Wirkung hin zu kontrollieren. Werden Massnahmen ergriffen, dürfen diese durch mangelnde Akzeptanz nicht zu Barrieren werden. Es muss sichergestellt sein, dass das System von den Tieren akzeptiert und genutzt wird.","doc_id":19692,"prior":"Klima","posterior":"Gefahren","SDG13":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24832","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Global maps of soil temperature","authors":"Lembrechts, Jonas J;

Infections by Xanthomonas spp. cause a wide variety of non-specific symptoms, making their identification difficult. The coexistence of phylogenetically close strains, but drastically different in their phenotype, poses an added challenge to diagnosis. Data on future climate change scenarios predict an increase in the severity of epidemics and a geographical expansion of pathogens, increasing pressure on plant health services. In this context, the effectiveness of integrated disease management strategies strongly depends on the availability of rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic methods. The accumulation of genomic information in recent years has facilitated the identification of new DNA markers, a cornerstone for the development of more sensitive and specific methods. Nevertheless, the challenges that the taxonomic complexity of this genus represents in terms of diagnosis together with the fact that within the same bacterial species, groups of strains may interact with distinct host species demonstrate that there is still a long way to go. In this review, we describe and discuss the current molecular-based methods for the diagnosis and detection of regulated Xanthomonas, taxonomic and diversity studies in Xanthomonas and genomic approaches for molecular diagnosis.","doc_id":20287,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"50","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24705","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Interventionen zur Förderung einer klimabewussten Ernährung : ein Feldexperiment in städtischen Verpflegungsbetrieben","authors":"Berger, Verena; Müller, Claudia; Egeler, Gian-Andrea; Bradford, Sebastian; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Ernährung; Klima; Nachhaltigkeitskommunikation; Verhaltensänderung;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"338.927, 640","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Interventionen zur Förderung einer klimabewussten Ernährung : ein Feldexperiment in städtischen Verpflegungsbetrieben; Ernährung; Klima; Nachhaltigkeitskommunikation; Verhaltensänderung;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben; Hintergrund: In der Schweiz werden fast % der Umweltbelastungen durch die Ernährung verursacht. Entsprechend groß ist das Interesse an wirksamen Maßnahmen zur Reduktion der ernährungsbedingten Umweltwirkungen. Neben Veränderungen Im Bereich Produktion oder Foodwaste, sind Ansätze im Bereich Konsum nötig, um Ernährungsgewohnheiten zu brechen und eine umweltfreundliche Ernährung zu fördern. Welche Interventionen in stadtzürcher Personalrestaurants (PR) und Alterszentren (AZ) einfach umsetzbar sind und die umweltfreundliche Wahl fördern, wurde in einem Feldexperiment mit  Betrieben ( Kontrollbetriebe) untersucht.Methoden: Die Interventionen wurden auf Basis der Literatur entwickelt und, wie auch das Menüangebot, mit den Betrieben auf die örtlichen Gegebenheiten und Möglichkeiten angepasst. Vor und nach der -wöchigen Interventionszeit wurden Befragungen in PR und AZ durchgeführt, um u.a. weitere Informationen zu den Gästen, deren Einstellungen, Essverhalten und Preisbereitschaften (bei den PR) zu erhalten. Zusätzlich wurden Verkaufszahlen erhoben. Ergebnisse: Die Intervention „Menüwechsel”, bei der Fleisch und Vegi-Menüs auf den Menülinien zufällig wechselten, hatte in PR und AZ den größten Effekt. Wenn auch andere Maßnahmen, wie z.B. eine farbliche Kennzeichnung oder ein Wettbewerb, zu keinen starken Veränderungen in der Menüwahl führten, zeigten die Befragungen, dass sie von den Gästen und auch von den Bewohner*innen positiv bewertet wurden. Schlussfolgerung: Mit einfach umsetzbaren Maßnahmen wie der zufälligen Umplatzierung von Menüs im Menüplan, können ernährungsbedingte Umweltauswirkungen sowohl in PR als auch in AZ reduziert werden. Weitere, im Projekt getestete Interventionen könnten mit kleinen Anpassungen erfolgversprechend angewendet werden. Darüber hinaus kann ein Angebot mit ausgewogenen und schmackhaften vegetarischen Menüs einen zusätzlichen Beitrag leisten, um die Wahl umweltfreundlicher Menüs zusätzlich zu fördern.","doc_id":20596,"prior":"Klima","posterior":"Produktion","SDG13":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18671","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Schlussevaluation Wirkungsverstärkung Umweltunterricht","authors":"Müller, Urs; Meier, Rahel","subject":"Wirkungsevaluation; Umweltbildung;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Bildung und Erziehung","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333.7, 370","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Schlussevaluation Wirkungsverstärkung Umweltunterricht; Wirkungsevaluation; Umweltbildung;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Bildung und Erziehung; Praktischer Umweltschutz Schweiz Pusch bietet an den Volksschulen der Deutschschweiz Umweltunterricht zu den drei Themenbereichen Abfall und Konsum, Energie und Klima sowie Wasser an.

Als Modellorganismus wurden kleine Holzbohrer Xyleborus saxesenii gewählt. Der Fokus liegt aber nicht auf der Biologie, sondern auf den physikalischen Grundlagen und der Technik zur bioakustischen Beobachtung von holzbewohnenden Insekten. Die physikalischen Grundlagen über Schall im Holz und der elektronischen Hilfsmittel sind in einem theoretischen Teil zusammengefasst und werden in einem Experiment umgesetzt. Ein wichtiger Anspruch hierbei war, dass die verwendeten Hard- und Softwares Open Source lizenziert sind. Der Kern der praktischen Arbeit ist die Entwicklung eines Vorverstärkers, mit dem ein piezoelektrischer Wandler als Körperschallmikrofon mit einem AudioMoth Rekorder verwendet werden kann. Die Datenauswertung wird in dieser Arbeit nur qualitativ gemacht, weitere Automatisierungen werden theoretisch diskutiert.; Bioacoustics is a promising method to better understand changes in ecosystems, to decide on appropriate measures and to evaluate their effectiveness.

The focus of this work is not on biology, but on physical principles and technology for bioacoustics observation of wood-inhabiting Insects. The physical basics about sound propagation in wood and the electronic instruments are summarized in a theoretical part and implemented in an experiment. An important requirement here was to use open source licensed hardware and software. The core of the practical work is the development of a preamplifier, with which a piezoelectric transducer can be used as a structure-borne sound microphone with an AudioMoth recorder.

There are several interventions reported in the literature (e.g., staff planning and teamwork development) that have the potential to reduce and limit rationed and missed nursing care, as well as positively influence the performance of selected nursing care activities. Yet, the number of studies and the level of evidence is low. There are currently no studies dealing with interventions focused on safety climate, ethical climate, or nurse education and experience, all of which might offer a potential benefit as they have shown to predict rationed and missed nursing care. Moreover, there is a lack of studies on the use of technology (e.g., telehealth, robotics) to support nurses, e.g., in the process of decision-making and priority setting. Implementation science could provide guidance on the development, implementation, and evaluation of effective interventions to reduce and limit rationed and missed nursing care and help tackle some of the methodological challenges to generate the needed evidence to understand, when, why, and how such interventions work. The aim of this chapter is to provide a synthesis of the literature and give some future perspectives on interventions that may reduce or limit rationed and missed nursing care.","doc_id":21252,"prior":"climate","posterior":"decision-making","SDG13":1},{"id":"78","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23769","date":"2021","language":"de; fr","title":"Schweizer Spitäler auf dem Weg zur Nachhaltigkeit : 50% der Spitäler könnten ihren Umwelt-Fussabdruck halbieren","authors":"Rippstein, Julia; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Ökobilanzierung; Nachhaltigkeit; Fussabdruck; Klimawandel; Gesundheitswesen; LCA; Spitäler;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338.927, 362.11","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Schweizer Spitäler auf dem Weg zur Nachhaltigkeit : % der Spitäler könnten ihren Umwelt-Fussabdruck halbieren; Ökobilanzierung; Nachhaltigkeit; Fussabdruck; Klimawandel; Gesundheitswesen; LCA; Spitäler;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","doc_id":21291,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"45","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8917","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Implications of potential future grand solar minimum for ozone layer and climate","authors":"Arsenovic, Pavle; Rozanov, Eugene; Anet, Julien; Stenke, Andrea; Schmutz, Werner; Peter, Thomas","subject":" Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"551","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Implications of potential future grand solar minimum for ozone layer and climate;  Geologie und Hydrologie; Continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are expected to cause further global warming throughout the st century.

In contrast, small to moderate volcanic eruptions, such as that of Nabro in , may easily double the stratospheric aerosol loading.","doc_id":21681,"prior":"climate","posterior":"emissions","SDG13":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8908","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The coupled atmosphere–chemistry–ocean model SOCOL-MPIOM","authors":"Muthers, S.; Anet, J.

Of these / are natural grasslands, mainly in arctic-alpine and coastal areas, while / are secondary grasslands created via millennia of human land management, such as grazing, mowing and burning. As long as technological constraints limited the intensity of use, grasslands accumulated a lot of biodiversity, making them now the most species-rich habitat for many taxa. The direct economic value of agricultural products from grasslands (mainly dairy and meat) is  billion EUR per year (.% of the Gross Domestic Product of the region), while other ecosystem services like water and nitrogen retention, erosion control, biodiversity conservation and touristic use of traditional cultural landscapes together have a significantly higher value. After World War II, the situation of grasslands changed dramatically due to the excessive use of artificial fertilizer, much increased livestock numbers and the large-scale homogenization of site conditions towards mesic nutrient-rich situations. On the other hand, less productive and more remote sites were not profitable for agricultural use anymore and thus were abandoned (and subject to secondary succession). Both intensification and abandonment have strong negative impacts on grassland biodiversity. Many grassland habitats and their species are now highly threatened. Further important threat factors for grasslands in the region are airborne eutrophication and conversion to other land uses (croplands, forests, built-up areas), while we consider climate change, biotic invasions and direct human impacts to be less relevant than often thought. While grasslands are underrepresented among the nationally protected areas of the region, the Habitats Directive of the European Union put many of the more threatened grassland types into the conservation focus, so that they are now reasonably covered in the Natura  network (spatially at least). Maintenance or restoration of semi-natural grasslands of High Nature Value (HNV) requires that they are managed in a way that mimics traditional agricultural use with hay-making and low-intensity grazing, but can also involve new approaches, such as controlled burning, “semi-open pasture landscapes” or “extensive green roofs”, which sometimes might be more feasible in the current socioeconomic situation. Semi-natural grasslands are a unique feature of the cultural landscapes of Europe. We conclude that conserving them and their biodiversity for the future requires a drastic further “greening” of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU and of similar instruments in the non-EU countries of the region, while at the same conservationists should be more open-minded towards conservation approaches that go beyond designation of protected areas and mimicking traditional grassland management.","doc_id":21722,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"42","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1053","date":"2016","language":"de","title":"Umsetzung der Energiestrategie 2050: Herausforderungen und Chancen für Staat und Wirtschaft","authors":"Abegg, Andreas; Benz, Astrid; Bergmann, Andreas; Braunreiter, Lukas; Brüesch, Caroline; Carabias-Hütter, Vicente; Cometta, Claudio; Conrad, Nicole; Eschenauer, Ursula; Fuchs, Sandro; Fürer, Seraina; Fuhrimann, Sandra; Gut, Madeleine; Haelg, Stephanie; Kobe, Carmen; Lobsiger-Kägi, Evelyn; Müller, Adrian W.; Nagel, Gabriela; Qvist-Sorensen, Peter; Schleiniger, Reto; Schmitt, Anna; Schuler, Christoph; Streiff, Gheorghita; Stücheli-Herlach, Peter; Trinkler, Gabriel; Weiss Sampietro, Theresia; Wiederkehr, René; Cometta, Claudio; Kobe, Carmen; Benz, Astrid","subject":"Forschungsbedarf; Handlungsfelder; Barrieren; Treiber; Akteure; Transformation; Smart City; Wirtschaftliche Zumutbarkeit; Netzzugang; «take-or-pay»-Klausel; Konfliktlösung; Gasmarktliberalisierung; Rohrleitungsgesetz; Implizite CO2-Preise; Internalisierung; Externe Kosten; Schweizerische Energie- und Klimapolitik; Wirtschaftlichkeit; Akzeptanz; Interessenabwägung; Standortkriterien; Standortwahl; Transparenz; Rechnungslegung; Konsolidierung; Energieversorgungsunternehmen; Beteiligung; Situative Diskursanalyse; Organisationskommunikation; Strategisches Management; Stakeholder-Management; Public Management; Subventionen von erneuerbaren und fossilen Energien; Schweizer Energiestrategie; Herausforderungen Energiestrategie 2050; Schweizer Energie-Benchmark; Öffentliche Organisationen; Energiewende;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Energietechnik","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333, 621.04","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Umsetzung der Energiestrategie : Herausforderungen und Chancen für Staat und Wirtschaft; Forschungsbedarf; Handlungsfelder; Barrieren; Treiber; Akteure; Transformation; Smart City; Wirtschaftliche Zumutbarkeit; Netzzugang; «take-or-pay»-Klausel; Konfliktlösung; Gasmarktliberalisierung; Rohrleitungsgesetz; Implizite CO-Preise; Internalisierung; Externe Kosten; Schweizerische Energie- und Klimapolitik; Wirtschaftlichkeit; Akzeptanz; Interessenabwägung; Standortkriterien; Standortwahl; Transparenz; Rechnungslegung; Konsolidierung; Energieversorgungsunternehmen; Beteiligung; Situative Diskursanalyse; Organisationskommunikation; Strategisches Management; Stakeholder-Management; Public Management; Subventionen von erneuerbaren und fossilen Energien; Schweizer Energiestrategie; Herausforderungen Energiestrategie ; Schweizer Energie-Benchmark; Öffentliche Organisationen; Energiewende;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Energietechnik; Sammelband der Reihe \"Energy Governance Working Paper\" Nr.  bis ; Die Energiestrategie  des Bundes definiert anspruchsvolle Ziele.

On the one hand, food value chains may provide benefits for society, such as employment opportunities or the provision of safe and sound food. On the other hand, these employment opportunities are not necessarily safe and in compliance with human dignity. Furthermore, food production contributes to environmental problems, such as global warming and degradation of natural habitats. However, in modern global food value chains, production-specific impacts are often shifted to net-exporting countries of agricultural commodities, such as Brazil. In order to prevent or minimize negative impacts and to increase positive impacts of food value chains, a thorough knowledge about implications is necessary. Therefore, the aim of this work was to support the development of sustainable food value chains by assessing ecological and socio-economic impacts of the Brazilian-Swiss chicken value chain. This value chain was selected as a case study of global food value chains, representing the most traded meat worldwide.; Lebensmittel-Wertschöpfungsketten (LWK) sind in eine natürliche und gesellschaftliche Umgebung eingebunden und haben daher vielfältige Auswirkungen. Einerseits können LWK zum Wohlstand der Gesellschaft beitragen, beispielsweise durch die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen oder die Bereitstellung gesunder Nahrungsmittel. Andererseits sind die geschaffenen Arbeitsplätze nicht zwingend sicher und menschenwürdig. Zudem ist die Produktion von Lebensmitteln mit vielfachen Umweltauswirkungen, wie dem Klimawandel und der Zerstörung natürlicher Habitate, verknüpft. In modernen globalen LWK werden die Auswirkungen, die durch die Produktion von Lebensmitteln entstehen, jedoch oftmals auf Netto-Exporteure von Landwirtschaftsprodukten, wie  beispielsweise Brasilien, abgewälzt.

Aufbauend auf drei Jahrzehnten Katastrophenrisikomodellierung, Risikopreisgestaltung, Forschung und Underwriting bietet die Versicherungsbranche ein einzigartiges Fachwissen, um Regierungen und andere Interessengruppen dabei zu unterstützen, finanzielle Widerstandsfähigkeit gegenüber den physischen Risiken des Klimawandels aufzubauen und die Lücke beim Schutz vor Naturkatastrophen zu schliessen. Jedoch bringt der Klimawandel nicht bloss physische Risiken für Versicherer mit sich. Neben Sachschäden verursacht durch Naturkatastrophen lassen sich Unmengen finanzieller Auswirkungen für Versicherungen, die aus Transitions- und Haftungsrisiken resultieren, ableiten. In Anbetracht dieser Tatsachen ist das Ziel dieser Bachelorarbeit die Evaluation der Auswirkungen, welche ‹Climate Disclosures› auf Versicherer haben, und die Beantwortung der Frage, ob das Verständnis im Umgang mit klimabedingten Risiken mittels deren Einsatz erhöht werden kann, wobei die Governance, die Strategie, das Risikomanagement sowie Messgrössen und Ziele analysiert werden. Dabei sollen im Ausblick Optionen hinsichtlich Anpassungen des Versicherungsgeschäftsmodells und künftige potenzielle Wettbewerbsvorteile von Versicherern diskutiert werden. Die empirische Forschung wird in einem ersten Schritt hauptsächlich mittels Internet- und Literaturrecherche erarbeitet. In einem zweiten Schritt wird für die Untersuchung der Erkenntnisse aus der Sekundäranalyse das qualitative Interview angewendet, bei dem Expertinnen- und Expertenmeinungen eingeholt und verglichen werden. Ferner werden die vorgeschlagenen Optionen mithilfe eines von Ernst and Young entwickelten und auf  Versicherungsgesellschaften angewandten ‹Climate Risk Disclosure Barometers› auf Abdeckung und Qualität der relevanten Kernelemente überprüft und bewertet. Durch die gewonnene Erkenntnis in dieser Bachelorarbeit können vier Handlungsempfehlungen abgegeben werden. Die erste Handlungsempfehlung liegt in der frühzeitigen Handhabung klimabedingter Risiken und die Definition einer Strategie, um diesen positiv II entgegenzuwirken. Zur zweiten Handlungsempfehlung gehört die Integration klimabedingter Risiken in die traditionellen Risikoklassen, den Underwriting- und Anlageprozess. Die dritte Handlungsempfehlung enthält die Analyse und Auswertungen klimabedingter Risiken durch Klimaberichterstattungen von Kunden und anderen relevanten Stakeholdern und die Anwendung des TCFD-Rahmenwerkes für die Offenlegung eigener Klimaberichterstattungen. Die vierte und letzte Handlungsempfehlung liegt im Verbreiten des erhöhten Bewusstseins über klimabedingte Risiken und den Klimawandel generell, denn dadurch können Versicherer über ihre breite Reichweite einen grossen Beitrag in der Adaption an den Klimawandel leisten und die Politik und Regulatoren mit wertvollen klimabedingten Informationen unterstützen. Generell gilt folgende Empfehlung: Versicherer, welche den Umgang mit klimabedingten Risiken besser verstehen und dadurch Handlungsoptionen für ihr künftiges Geschäftsmodell ableiten wollen, sollten bei der Klimaberichterstattung Kriterien wie Governance, Strategie, Riskmanagement sowie Messgrössen und Ziele berücksichtigen.","doc_id":22334,"prior":"Klimawandel","SDG13":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11745","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Environmental impacts and hotspots of food losses : value chain analysis of Swiss food consumption","authors":"Beretta, Claudio; Stucki, Matthias; Hellweg, Stefanie","subject":"Life Cycle Assessment; Ökobilanz; Food Waste;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Produktion","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333, 338","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Environmental impacts and hotspots of food losses : value chain analysis of Swiss food consumption; Life Cycle Assessment; Ökobilanz; Food Waste;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Produktion; Reducing food losses and waste is crucial to making our food system more efficient and sustainable.

Environmental impacts are expressed in terms of climate change and biodiversity impacts due to water and land use. Climate change impacts of food waste are highest for fresh vegetables, due to the large amounts wasted, while the specific impact per kg is largest for beef.

It has been argued that they have increasingly threatened to destabilise the economy while interfering with the fiscal goals of stability, full employment, sustainable growth and development for shared prosperity and welfare.Governments, institutions and the private sector now acknowledge the importance and urgency for coordinated action toward inclusive and sustainable outcomes and government actions. However, tweaking existing policies by adding discretionary programs within the “one size fits it all” paradigm could not address these issues effectively. It has been argued that pro-equity policies can reduce inequality and pro-green policies can strengthen climate change resilience and thus achieve sustainable outcomes under an integrated fiscal policy.This study reviews the existing literature in this field by employing a structured qualitative methodology to scope, contextualise and map the literature in this field. The paper focuses on inclusive and sustainable fiscal policy, which, through coordination and integration, achieves economic stability, inclusive growth, and sustainable development outcomes concurrently, i.e. the challenge of internalising economic activity’s social costs to render a net social surplus and neutralise environmental impact.This study evaluates the extent of the existing programs and policies by adopting a mixed-method qualitative analysis methodology that incorporates a scoping review and document analysis. It performs a structured analysis to uncover the effective policy variables, drivers and impediments. The document analysis method complements the scoping review to extract the thematic meaning, article design and metadata of the analysed documents in the context of the declared sustainability goals.

With the recent upsurge in petroleum prices coupled with intrinsic volatility of international oil markets, it is fast turning into a politico-socio-economic dilemma for countries like India to sustain future subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and compare the environmental performance of various cooking fuel options, namely LPG (NG), LPG (CO), kerosene, coal, electricity, firewood, crop residue, dung cake, charcoal, and biogas, in the Indian context. The purpose of this study is to find environmentally suitable alternatives to LPG and kerosene for rural and urban areas of the country.Methods: The study assessed the cooking fuel performance on  ReCiPe environmental impact categories using the life cycle assessment methodology. The study modeled the system boundary for each fuel based on the Indian scenario and prepared a detailed life cycle inventory for each cooking fuel taking  GJ of heat energy transferred to cooking pot as the functional unit.Results and discussion: The cooking fuels with the lowest life cycle environmental impacts are biogas followed by LPG, kerosene, and charcoal. The environmental impacts of using LPG are about  to  % lower than kerosene for most environmental impact categories. LPG derived from natural gas has about  to  % lower environmental impact than LPG derived from crude oil. Coal and dung cake have the highest environmental impacts because of significant contributions to climate change and particulate formation, respectively. Charcoal produced from renewable wood supply performs better than kerosene on most impact categories except photochemical oxidation, where its contribution is  times higher than kerosene.Conclusions: Biogas and charcoal can be viewed as potentially sustainable cooking fuel options in the Indian context because of their environmental benefits and other associated co-benefits such as land farming, local employment opportunities, and skill development. The study concluded that kerosene, biogas, and charcoal for rural areas and LPG, kerosene, and biogas for urban areas have the lower environmental footprint among the chosen household cooking fuels in the study.","doc_id":23212,"prior":"climate change","SDG13":1},{"id":"44","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23565","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Opportunities for passive cooling to mitigate the impact of climate change in Switzerland","authors":"Silva, Ricardo; Eggimann, Sven; Fierz, Léonie; Fiorentini, Massimo; Orehounig, Kristina; Baldini, Luca","subject":"Night ventilation; Window shading; Space cooling demand; Climate adaptation; Building; Decarbonisation;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"620","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Opportunities for passive cooling to mitigate the impact of climate change in Switzerland; Night ventilation; Window shading; Space cooling demand; Climate adaptation; Building; Decarbonisation;  Ingenieurwesen; Energy systems need to decarbonize rapidly whilst satisfying heating and cooling needs.

Für die Ökosystemdienstleistungen, die klimatischen Bedingungen und für die Ästhetik sind Stadtbäume als grüne Infrastruktur einer Stadt wichtige Vegetationsformen. Nach rund  Standjahren oder einem Brusthöhenumfang von cm erreichen Stadtbäume ihre volle ökologische Leistungsfähigkeit. Dies ist insofern problematisch, da viele Stadtbäume nach - () Standjahren ersetzt werden. Um die für die Stadt wichtigen Leistungen erbringen zu können, muss die Standzeit und Lebensdauer der Bäume erheblich erhöht werden.Diese Thematik gewann in jüngerer Vergangenheit an Interesse und Dynamik in der Praxis und Forschung. Insbesondere die Sortimentsentwicklung, Management-Modelle und Standortverbesserungen mit strukturstabilen Substraten sind zentrale Aspekte der Forschung. In dieser Masterarbeit wird anhand von Literaturrecherchen und Fachgesprächen die Thematik aufgearbeitet und der Stand der Praxis und Forschung (State of the Art) dargestellt. Anhand der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse wird in einem Praxisversuch ein strukturstabiles Stadtbaumsubstrat entwickelt und getestet.Die Substrate von urbanen Pflanzungen, insbesondere von Strassenbäumen sind schon heute und werden auch in Zukunft massiven Belastungen und Wechselwirkungen ausgesetzt sein. Die Belastungen werden in innerstädtischen Gebieten unter anderem aufgrund städtebaulicher Nachverdichtung weiter zunehmen. Das Substrat soll urbane Grünräume in ihrer Vitalität und Wüchsigkeit unterstützen, gleichzeitig aber auch als Tragschicht im Strassenbau eingesetzt werden können. Während physikalische Parameter weitestgehend genormt sind, sind bei den chemischen Daten noch keine umfassenden Kenntnisse vorhanden.Das Substrat mit dem Zusatz von Pflanzenkohle entspricht den Bedingungen des Tiefbaus und kann strukturstabil, schichtweise eingebaut werden. Aktuelle Forschungsergebnisse zeigen, dass die sehr sorptionsfähige Pflanzenkohle den organischen Kohlenstoff und die Nährstoffe langfristig stabilisiert. Doch die Nährstoffgehalte sind im Vergleich zu marktfähigen Substraten relativ gering. Dennoch haben die Testbäume in der Anwuchsphase keine Mangelerscheinungen gezeigt.Im Best Practice Beispiel, dem Wädenswiler Stadtbaum-Modell, wird der optimale Einbau des Substrates, um eine Wurzelausbreitung und Kommunikation zu ermöglichen, sowie die optimale Jungbaumpflege behandelt.

As the green infrastructure of a metropolitan area, those trees are an important type of vegetation for ecosystem services, climatic conditions and aesthetics. After approximately  years of cultivation or with a circumference at breast height of  cm, city trees reach their full ecological potential. This is problematic to the extent that many city trees are replaced - () years after planting. In order to perform the services that are important for the city, the years of cultivation and lifespan of the trees must be increased considerably. This subject matter has attracted interest and gained momentum in practice and research in the recent past. Key aspects of research are: using different or new type of trees, management models and habital improvement with structural soils.This master thesis processes the aforementioned subject matter based on literature and expert discussions and will present the current state of the art. On the basis of the findings, a structural soil substrate is developed and tested in a practical trial.The substrates of urban plantings, particularly those of trees along streets, have to contend with severe burdens and are exposed to interactions and interdependencies that are currently adversely affecting them and will continue to do so in the future. These problems will further increase in urban areas due to densification of urban buildings, climate change, among others. The substrate is supposed to not only support urban green spaces in their vitality and growing but also to be used as base course in road construction.
