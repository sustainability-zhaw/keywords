Research questions about this discrepancy have not been fully answered. This study applies artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to explore the complex network of factors and the cause-effect relationships affecting the place of death, with the ultimate aim of developing policies favouring home-based end-of-life care.Methods: A data mining algorithm and a causal probabilistic model for data analysis were developed with information derived from expert knowledge that was merged with data from  deceased cancer patients in southern Switzerland. This data set was obtained via a retrospective clinical chart review.Results: Dependencies of disease and treatment-related decisions demonstrate an influence on the place of death of %. Anticancer treatment in advanced disease prevents or delays communication about the end of life between oncologists, patients and families. Unknown preferences for the place of death represent a great barrier to a home death. A further barrier is the limited availability of family caregivers for terminal home care. The family’s preference for the last place of care has a high impact on the place of death of %, while the influence of the patient’s preference is low, at %. Approximately one-third of family systems can be empowered by health care professionals to provide home care through open end-of-life communication and good symptom management. Such intervention has an influence on the place of death of %. If families express a convincing preference for home care, the involvement of a specialist palliative home care service can increase the probability of home deaths by %.Conclusion:Concerning death at home, open communication about death and dying is essential. Furthermore, for the patient preference for home care to be respected, the family’s decision for the last place of care seems to be key. The early initiation of family-centred palliative care and the provision of specialist palliative home care for patients who wish to die at home are suggested.","doc_id":63,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"87","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18842","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Harvesting energy from trees in order to power LPWAN IoT nodes","authors":"Meli, Marcel; Hegetschweiler, Lukas","subject":"LoRaWAN; LPWAN; LoRa; Wireless; Low power; Energy harvesting; TEG;  Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Harvesting energy from trees in order to power LPWAN IoT nodes; LoRaWAN; LPWAN; LoRa; Wireless; Low power; Energy harvesting; TEG;  Informatik; Low Power Wide Area Network (aka LPWAN or LPWA or LPN) nodes are important components in the IoT chain. They allow energy-efficient wireless communications between elements that can be several kilometers apart. This in turn should enable energy savings and facilitate the deployment of energy autonomous devices. However, energy autonomy is still in its infancy, as far as LPWAN is concerned. Most nodes run on mains or batteries. Mains seriously limit the mobility of the nodes and are only used in special cases. Batteries often lead to maintenance costs issues. Scavenging energy from the surroundings to achieve energy autonomy is an alternative that has hardly been used for LPWAN systems. In cases where energy harvesting has been used, solar energy has been the most popular source. Other methods are possible and could even be important alternatives. In this work we harvest energy from trees using TEGs. That energy is stored and used to power a long-range wireless embedded system (LoRaWAN in this case). Tests made for several months have shown that this method works well.

From a security point of view, this leads to high exposure of such IoT devices. Consequently, even though they are highly resource-constrained, these IoT devices need to fulfil similar security requirements as conventional computers. The challenge is to leverage well-known cybersecurity techniques for such devices without dramatically increasing power consumption (and therefore reducing battery lifetime) or the cost regarding memory sizes and required processor performance. Various semi-conductor vendors have introduced dedicated hardware devices, so-called secure elements that address these cryptographic challenges. Secure elements provide tamper-resistant memory and hardware-accelerated cryptographic computation support. Moreover, they can be used for mutual authentication with peers, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality, and various other security-related use cases. Nevertheless, publicly available performance figures on energy consumption and execution times are scarce. This paper introduces the concept of secure elements and provides a measurement setup for selected individual cryptographic primitives and a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) handshake over secure Constrained Application Protocol (CoAPs) in a realistic use case. Consequently, the paper presents quantitative results for the performance of five secure elements. Based on these results, we discuss the characteristics of the individual secure elements and supply developers with the information needed to select a suitable secure element for a specific application.","doc_id":394,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4858","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Thinking about movement hurts : the effect of motor imagery on pain and swelling in people with chronic arm pain","authors":"Moseley, G.

Pain and swelling were measured before, after, and  minutes after the task. Electromyography findings verified no muscle activity. Patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) were compared with those with non‐CRPS pain.

The application of resistant cultivars would be an additional measure against FB limiting the dependence on antibiotic treatments and the dormant risk for producers to lose their only effective control measure. However, today there is no popular FB resistant apple variety available. Strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance were identified e.g. in the wild apple ‘Malus × robusta ’ (MR). The present work aimed firstly to provide usable molecular markers tightly linked to the resistance locus of MR and secondly to isolate and characterize the source of MR resistance against Erwinia amylovora.  new molecular markers were developed and mapped to the top of linkage group (LG)  of MR containing the resistance locus. Together, they defined the distal . cM of LG  of MR. After phenotyping of recombinant individuals of an expanded population of more than  individuals segregating for MR resistance, the locus of the resistance trait was flanked by two markers defining an interval of . cM. By means of chromosome landing two bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) harboring the genomic DNA of MR were identified, one of which was in coupling and one in repulsion to the alleles of the flanking markers. Using differently trained protein prediction software (FGENESH) - open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted on the assembled sequences derived from the resistance carrying BAC. The predicted mRNAs were annotated and compared to the constitutional transcriptome of MR to evaluate the prediction algorithms. The annotation and subsequent motif analysis led to the identification of one candidate resistance (R) gene named FB_MR. We investigated the candidate resistance gene, which was demonstrated to be constitutionally expressed in MR as well as in resistant progenies of MR, but not in susceptible cultivars (‘Idared’, ‘La Flamboyante’, ‘Gala’) and susceptible progenies of MR. FB_MR was cloned and resequenced. FB_MR was classified in silico as CC-NBS-LRR protein (CNL, coiled coil nucleotide binding site leucine rich repeat). All investigated CNLs giving resistance towards bacterial diseases function in accordance to the ‘decoy model’ or ‘guard model’ which postulate the interaction of () the R protein of the host, which recognizes conformational changes or degradation of () the ‘decoy’/‘guardee’ protein interacting with () the bacterial effector (Avr protein). Taking into account the recently published findings on host-microbe interactions in other plants and the presence and absence, respectively, of transcribed putative decoys/guardees in MR transcriptome as well as the presence and absence, respectively, of Avr genes in E. amylovora, we hypothesized a homologous mode of function of FB_MR to RPS of Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, to give evidence to the functionality of FB_MR acting as R gene against FB, a complementation assay into susceptible cultivar ‘Gala’ was appended as preliminary results in this thesis. Two constructs comprising FB_MR under the control of CaMV s promoter and its own promoter, respectively, were cloned into ‘Gala’ via Agrobacterium tumefaciens.  newly developed transgenic shoots are growing to a usable size for micro grafting on M rootstocks and will later be inoculated with E. amylovora.","doc_id":734,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23625","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Bauteile wiederverwenden","authors":"Stricker, Eva","subject":"Bauteilwiedervewendung; Wiederverwendung; Reuse; Nachhaltiges Bauen; Ressourceneffizienz; Architektur der Wiederverwendung;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk;  Architektur","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"690, 720","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Bauteile wiederverwenden; Bauteilwiedervewendung; Wiederverwendung; Reuse; Nachhaltiges Bauen; Ressourceneffizienz; Architektur der Wiederverwendung;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk;  Architektur","doc_id":740,"prior":"Ressourceneffizienz","SDG12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8546","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"BICAR : neue Dimensionen für die urbane Shared Mobility","authors":"Sauter-Servaes, Thomas; Burri, Adrian; Berger, Salome","subject":"Stadtverkehr; Shared Mobility; Nachhaltigkeit; Ressourceneffizienz;  Kommunikation und Verkehr","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"380","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"BICAR : neue Dimensionen für die urbane Shared Mobility; Stadtverkehr; Shared Mobility; Nachhaltigkeit; Ressourceneffizienz;  Kommunikation und Verkehr; Die Nutzung öffentlicher Fahrzeugflotten gewinnt immer mehr an Akzeptanz.

Solarstrom gilt als umweltfreundlich, da während des Betriebs der Anlagen kaum Schadstoffemissionen anfallen. Ökobilanzen sind ein Instrument, um den Ressourcenverbrauch und die Emissionen nicht nur im Betrieb, sondern entlang des ganzen Lebenswegs von Produkten zu quantifizieren und zu bewerten. Ziel der vorliegenden Masterarbeit ist es Ökobilanzen über aktuelle Unterkonstruktionen und deren Grad an Integration in die Gebäudehülle zu erstellen. Der Lebenszyklus der Solarstromproduktion umfasst dabei sowohl die Herstellung der Anlagenkomponenten als auch den Transport, die Montage, den Betrieb und die Entsorgung der Anlagen.Mit Planungssoftware der verschiedenen Hersteller oder deren Planungsabteilungen wurden Materiallisten der einzelnen Unterkonstruktionen erstellt. In einem ersten Schritt wurden die Umweltauswirkungen der Systeme direkt miteinander verglichen. Für den Vergleich von Strom ab den verschiedenen Anlagen wurden mit Hilfe von einem geografischen Informationssystem für Photovoltaik (PVGIS) die Ertragsberechnungen durchgeführt sowie aus der Zollhandelsstatistik die nötigen Daten zu Transport und Herkunft von Modulen und Laminaten abgerufen.Die Treibhausgasemissionen der bilanzierten Anlagen liegen zwischen . und . g CO-eq. pro kWh Strom. Je höher der Stromertrag auf Grund des Anlagentyps und der Sonneneinstrahlung an einem Standort ist, desto tiefer sind die Umweltauswirkungen des produzierten Stroms. Strom ab den bilanzierten Anlagen auf der multikristallinen Silicium-Technologie verursacht mit durchschnittlich . g CO-eq./kWh ein Fünftel weniger Treibhausgasemissionen als der heutige schweizerische Verbrauchermix.Die Höhe der Umweltauswirkungen der Unterkonstruktionen ist sehr unterschiedlich und hauptsächlich von der Menge an verwendetem Aluminium abhängig. Die tiefsten Werte beim direkten Vergleich der Unterkonstruktionen erreichen bei sämtlichen Indikatoren die Mehrheit der vollintegrierten Systeme auf dem Dach. Wird bei der Herstellung der Unterkonstruktionen beim Aluminium ein Recyclinganteil von  % verwendet, nimmt die absolute Umweltauswirkung um über zwei Drittel ab.Um die Umweltauswirkungen von Solarenergie möglichst tief zu halten, sind der Standort und die Wahl des Anlagentyps entscheidend. Hersteller von Solaranlagekomponenten können ihre Produkte ökologisch optimieren, indem sie beim Aluminium Recyclingmaterial verwenden und die Menge nach Möglichkeit reduzieren.","doc_id":827,"prior":"Ökobilanz","SDG12":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1874","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Bergsteigen in Nepal - eine Ökobilanz","authors":"Kappeler, Christina","subject":"Ökobilanz; Bergsteigen; Nepal; Nachhaltiger Tourismus;  Freizeit und Tourismus;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"306.48, 333.7","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Bergsteigen in Nepal - eine Ökobilanz; Ökobilanz; Bergsteigen; Nepal; Nachhaltiger Tourismus;  Freizeit und Tourismus;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; In dieser Masterarbeit werden die Umweltauswirkungen des Bergsteigens in Nepal, anhand des Beispiels einer Besteigung des Mount Everest untersucht.

Most care for older people is in the acute setting, but there is little evidence to inform the delivery of empowering hospital care.Objective: We aimed to explore challenges to and facilitators of empowerment among older people with advanced disease in hospital, and the impact of palliative care.Methods: We conducted an ethnography in six hospitals in England, Ireland and the USA. The ethnography involved: interviews with patients aged ≥, informal caregivers, specialist palliative care (SPC) staff and other clinicians who cared for older adults with advanced disease, and fieldwork. Data were analysed using directed thematic analysis.Results: Analysis of  interviews and  h of observational data revealed substantial challenges to empowerment: poor communication and information provision, combined with routinised and fragmented inpatient care, restricted patients’ self-efficacy, self-management, choice and decision-making. Information and knowledge were often necessary for empowerment, but not sufficient: empowerment depended on patient-centredness being enacted at an organisational and staff level. SPC facilitated empowerment by prioritising patient-centred care, tailored communication and information provision, and the support of other clinicians.Conclusions: Empowering older people in the acute setting requires changes throughout the health system. Facilitators of empowerment include excellent staff-patient communication, patient-centred, relational care, an organisational focus on patient experience rather than throughput, and appropriate access to SPC. Findings have relevance for many high- and middle-income countries with a growing population of older patients with advanced disease.","doc_id":1050,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17858","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The effects of trans-theoretical model and fear of dental care on dental cleaning behavior among students","authors":"Allahqoli, Leila; Nithyanantham, Vinnaras; Rahmani, Azam; Fallahi, Arezoo; Fathi, Arzieh; Azadi, Nammam Ali; Pashaei, Tahereh; Volken, Thomas","subject":"Behavior; Fear; Oral health; Students; Trans-theoretical model;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"The effects of trans-theoretical model and fear of dental care on dental cleaning behavior among students; Behavior; Fear; Oral health; Students; Trans-theoretical model;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Background: Fear of dental care prevents dental cleaning behavior and increases the prevalence of dental caries.

Die höheren Temperaturen bringen in den Städten eine Reihe von schwerwiegenden gesundheitlichen und wirtschaftlichen Problemen mit sich, von welchen immer mehr Menschen betroffen sein werden. Forschende auf der ganzen Welt versuchen, die genauen Ursachen und den exakten Nutzen von Gegenmassnahmen zu quantifizieren. Eine wichtige Grundlage dieser Untersuchungen ist die Messung der Temperaturverteilung in Städten. Am exaktesten kann diese mittels einer Vielzahl von Messstationen, die auf dem ganzen Stadtgebiet verteilt sind, erfasst werden. Da Messstationen teuer sind, ist es schwierig, ein dichtes Messnetz zu etablieren, weshalb oft nur über kurze Zeit oder mit zu wenigen Messpunkten gemessen werden kann. Zudem weisen gängige Stationen meist einen zu hohen Strahlungsfehler auf oder benötigen zum dauerhaften Betrieb eines Ventilators einen Netzanschluss.Das Ziel dieser Bachelorarbeit war die Entwicklung einer Messstation, welche die Temperatur und relative Luftfeuchtigkeit exakt erfasst, die Messwerte automatisch und drahtlos übermittelt und weniger als Fr. .- kostet. Die Messstation soll mindestens ein Jahr ohne externe Energieversorgung betrieben werden können. Dies erforderte die Entwicklung eines Strahlenschutzgehäuses, von Mess- und Funkelektronik und von Steuerungssoftware. Zudem wurde eine Kostenschätzung für eine Serienproduktion der Messstation unternommen.Basierend auf Recherchen zu meteorologischen Messmethoden und Strahlenschutzgehäusen wurden Bauteile, Baumaterialien, elektronische Komponenten und Fertigungsverfahren evaluiert und getestet. Die ausgewählte Sensorik und Elektronik wurde miniaturisiert und in den Gehäuseprototypen, der aus D-Druck- und Blechteilen besteht, eingebaut. LoRaWAN wurde als Funkstandard ausgewählt und seine Funktionalität getestet. Zudem wurde die Software für die Messstation und einen Server, welcher die empfangenen Messdaten auswertet, entwickelt. Mittels einer einfachen physikalischen Modellbildung, verschiedenen Versuchen und nichtlinearen Ausgleichsrechnungen wurde zudem ein Extrapolationsalgorithmus etabliert, welcher exakte Messungen bei geringem Energieverbrauch ermöglicht.Aus der Arbeit resultieren zwei Prototypen, welche automatisch Messwerte sammeln und übermitteln. Die Messstation weist auch bei starker Sonneneinstrahlung eine Messgenauigkeit von K auf. In der Testphase wiesen die Prototypen im Vergleich mit einer Referenzstation in .% der Fälle eine Abweichung von weniger als ±.K auf. Die Messgenauigkeit der relativen Luftfeuchtigkeit betrug ±%RH. Zudem wurden Kostenschätzungen für die Produktion von ,  und  Messstationen erstellt. Der Materialpreis bei  Stück liegt bei Fr. .- pro Messstation.Obwohl das geforderte Kostendach nicht eingehalten werden konnte, resultieren eine Vielzahl von wichtigen Erkenntnissen aus dieser Arbeit. Im Ausblick werden zudem mögliche Untersuchungen und Anpassungen, welche die Messstation bezüglich Kosten, Energieeffizienz und Messgenauigkeit weiter optimieren könnten, diskutiert. Mit dieser Arbeit konnte ein wichtiger Beitrag zur besseren Untersuchung des urbanen Hitzeinseleffekts geleistet werden.","doc_id":1374,"prior":"drahtlos","SDG12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/804","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Krebsdiagnose: Zum Zusammenhang von Krankheitsverarbeitung (Coping) und posttraumatischem Wachstum (posttraumatic growth)","authors":"Zollinger, Danielle","subject":"Krebs (Medizin); Diagnose; Krankheit; Psychische Verarbeitung; Bewältigung; Posttraumatisches Stresssyndrom;  Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"150","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Krebsdiagnose: Zum Zusammenhang von Krankheitsverarbeitung (Coping) und posttraumatischem Wachstum (posttraumatic growth); Krebs (Medizin); Diagnose; Krankheit; Psychische Verarbeitung; Bewältigung; Posttraumatisches Stresssyndrom;  Psychologie","doc_id":1463,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"59","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20484","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"If-then plans help regulate automatic peer influence on impulse buying","authors":"Thürmer, J.

Study  (N = ) obtained causal evidence that forming an implementation intention (i.e. an if-then plan designed to automate action control) reduces peer impact on impulse buying in a laboratory experiment with young adults (students) selecting food items. Study  (N = ) obtained correlational evidence for the role of norms, automaticity and implementation intentions in impulse buying using a large sample of high-school adolescents working on a vignette about clothes-shopping. If-then plans reduced impulse purchases in the laboratory (Study ). Both reported deliberation on peer norms and the reported automaticity of shopping with peers predicted impulse buying but an implementation intention to be thriftily reduced these links (Study ). This research highlights the role of automatic social processes in problematic consumer behaviour. Promising field studies and neuropsychological experiments are discussed. Young consumers can gain control over automatic peer influence by using if-then plans, thereby reducing impulse buying. This research helps understand new precursors of impulse buying in understudied European samples of young consumers.","doc_id":1636,"prior":"consumer behaviour","SDG12":1},{"id":"89","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1866","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Wireless monitoring of manufacturing equipment powered by energy harvesting","authors":"Gruber, Juan-Mario","subject":" Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"004, 621.3","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Wireless monitoring of manufacturing equipment powered by energy harvesting;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; This presentation discusses the concept and realization of an energy autarkic condition monitoring system.

Die psychologische Komponente hat dabei einen grossen Einfluss auf das Erleben der Schmerzen. Es ist daher wichtig, diese in die Behandlung miteinzubeziehen. Mit dem Prinzip der Mindfulness und dem daraus erarbeiteten Konzept des MBSR können neben der physischen Behandlung auch psychologische Behandlungsansätze integriert werden.Ziel :  Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, zu evaluieren, inwiefern Aspekte aus dem MBSR in die physiotherapeutische Behandlung von Fibromyalgiebetroffenen integriert werden können.Methode :  Zur Literaturrecherche wurden die gesundheitsspezifischen Datenbanken CINAHL, MEDLINE, AMED und PsychInfo verwendet. Dadurch wurden vier RCTs zur genauen Analyse ausgewählt. Diese wurden anhand der AICA-Hilfstabelle (Arbeitsinstrument für ein Critical Appraisal) kritisch beurteilt und diskutiert.Relevante Ergebnisse :  Durch MBSR konnten in den Studien der empfundene Stress, die Schwere der Symptome im Allgemeinen und die funktionellen Einschränkungen verbessert werden.Schlussfolgerung :  Um ein positives und langanhaltendes Ergebnis zu erzielen, müssen Heimübungen regelmässig durchgeführt werden. Das MBSR-Programm ist anspruchsvoll und müsste eventuell für schwer betroffene Personen angepasst werden.; Description of the subject :  The treatment of fibromyalgia poses a challenge for physiotherapists. The disease pattern is very complex and accompanied by non-specific pain. The psychological component has thereby a great impact on the perception of pain. It is therefore important to include psychology-based approaches in the treatment of fibromyalgia. With the help of the principle of mindfulness and the resulting concept of MBSR, psychological treatment approaches can be applied in addition to physical treatment.Objective :  The aim of this thesis is to evaluate how aspects of MBSR could be integrated into the physiotherapist’s treatment of fibromyalgia patients.Methods :  The health-specific databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, AMED and PsychInfo were used for the literature search. The research resulted in four RCTs, which were critically evaluated and discussed using the AICA-form (Arbeitsinstrument für ein Critical Appraisal).Relevant results :  MBSR has been able to improve the perceived stress, the severity of symptoms in general and functional impairments in the studies.Conclusion :  In order to achieve a positive and long-lasting result, home exercises must be performed regularly. The MBSR program is demanding and might need to be adapted for severely affected persons.","doc_id":1681,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1293","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Compliance bezüglich Inkontinenz-Therapie von stationären Patientinnen und Patienten mit COPD","authors":"Ernst, Anja","subject":" Physiotherapie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.82","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Compliance bezüglich Inkontinenz-Therapie von stationären Patientinnen und Patienten mit COPD;  Physiotherapie; Darstellung der Thematik: Die Prävalenz von Harninkontinenz wird weltweit auf ca.

In the practice, it is often difficult to provide enough energy when the temperature differences are small. It is well known that the impedance of the harvester can strongly influence the performance of the booster and therefore have an impact on the cost of the harvesting system. In this work, we present a booster architecture that allows a good impedance matching for existing TEG harvesters. The amount of energy harvested for a small temperature difference is high enough to allow the efficient use of small commercial TEGs.

This paper presents the results of the workshop related to three key questions: () what are the benefits of ecological engineering practices to human and ecosystem well-being, () which concepts are used or useful to identify, reference, and measure the benefits of ecological engineering practices, and () how and to whom shall benefits of ecological engineering practices be promoted. While benefits of ecological engineering practices are diverse, general conclusions can be derived to facilitate communication. Identifying benefits requires valuation frameworks reaching beyond the scope of ecology and engineering. A distinction between human and ecosystem well-being in this regard may not be easy or useful, but instead humans embedded in ecosystems should be addressed as a whole. The concepts of resource efficiency, ecosystem services, ecosystem health, and multifunctional land use could serve as suitable references to frame ecological engineering benefits, as well as referring to international political goals such as biodiversity protection, climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. Sector and application specific criteria of good practice could be worked out. Regional, area specific reference systems for sustainable development could provide comparative advantages for ecologically engineered solutions.

Basierend auf diesen Daten wurden Sachbilanzen für je zwei verschiedene Naturrasen und Kunststoffrasen sowie einen Hybridrasen erstellt, die alle Lebenszyklusphasen abdecken. Die Ökobilanz umfasst eine Auswahl der vom Joint Research Council der Europäischen Kommission empfohlenen Indikatoren für den organisatorischen und produktbezogenen ökologischen Fussabdruck sowie die aggregierte Gesamtumweltbelastung nach Methode der ökologische Knappheit in Umweltbelastungspunkten und Human- und Ökotoxizität nach USEtox.Berücksichtigt werden die Umweltauswirkungen anhand der untersuchten Wirkungskategorien von der Produktion und dem Bau der Rasensportfelder über die Pflege und Renovation bis zum Rückbau und der Entsorgung. Nicht in diese Ökobilanz-Studie einbezogen werden indirekte Umweltauswirkungen, welche durch die Nutzer der Rasensportfelder entstehen, z.B. während der An- und Rückfahrt sowie durch die benötigte Sportkleidung oder Ernährung. Die Datengrundlage dieser Studie basiert auf Werten der Stadt Zürich. Die Resultate können daher nur bedingt auf andere geografische Regionen adaptiert werden. Bei theoretisch maximal möglicher Nutzungsdauer, die sich je nach Rasentyp unterscheidet, verursacht bei allen untersuchten Indikatoren ausser Treibhausgasemissionen und Primärenergiebedarf über den gesamten Lebenszyklus gesehen das unverfüllte Kunststoffrasensportfeld die tiefsten Umweltauswirkungen. Danach ist das Resultat unterschiedlich für die weiteren Rasensportfelder in Abhängigkeit der untersuchten Umweltauswirkungen.Die Erstellung von Naturrasensportfeldern, mit oder ohne Dränschicht, hat bei allen untersuchten Indikatoren die geringsten Umweltauswirkungen pro Quadratmeter. Der Bau von Hybrid- oder Kunststoffrasenspielfeldern (unverfüllt oder verfüllt) hat vergleichbar oder deutlich höhere Umweltauswirkungen für die unterschiedlichen Indikatoren, da grosse Mengen an synthetischen Materialien benötigt werden. Während des Betriebs sind die Umweltauswirkungen bei Natur- und Hybridrasen im Vergleich zu Kunststoffrasen deutlich höher, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Eutrophierung, da die Herstellung des erforderlichen Mineraldüngers energieintensiv ist und die Emissionen bei seiner Ausbringung eine stark eutrophierende Wirkung haben.Der wichtigste Faktor für die Umweltauswirkungen ist jedoch die jährliche Nutzungszeit. Kunststoff- und Hybridrasen können im Vergleich zu Naturrasen wesentlich länger bespielt werden pro Jahr. Bei optimaler Auslastung haben Kunststoffrasensportfelder deutlich geringere Umweltauswirkungen pro Nutzungsstunde.Die jährliche Nutzungszeit ist jedoch nicht nur abhängig vom Rasensportfeld, sondern auch von der vorhandenen Infrastruktur. So sind die jährlichen Nutzungsstunden von Rasensportfeldern ohne Beleuchtung deutlich einschränkt. Des Weiteren sind zusätzliche Faktoren ausschlaggebend für die Nutzungsintensität und die daraus resultierende Qualität der Rasensportfelder. Auffallend ist bspw., dass Rasensportfelder, die ausschliesslich für das Training verwendet werden, eher übernutzt werden, während Felder, die auch für Meisterschaftsspiele genutzt werden, zum Teil (deutlich) unter dem Maximum ausgelastet sind.","doc_id":2286,"prior":"Ökobilanz","SDG12":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20363","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Impact of a diabetes disease management program on quality of care and costs : propensity score-matched real-world data from Switzerland","authors":"Carlander, Maria; Hoeglinger, Marc; Trottmann, Maria; Rhomberg, Birgitta; Caviglia, Cornelia; Rohrbasser, Adrian; Frei, Christian; Eichler, Klaus","subject":"Cost; Quality of life; Diabetes mellitus; Disease management;  Gesundheitsökonomie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"362.1041, 616","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Impact of a diabetes disease management program on quality of care and costs : propensity score-matched real-world data from Switzerland; Cost; Quality of life; Diabetes mellitus; Disease management;  Gesundheitsökonomie;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Objectives Structured treatment programs have been recommended for management of patients with chronic conditions to overcome ill-coordinated care.

Methods We performed a prospective observational study with a propensity score-matched usual care control group from a claims database. We included type- and type- diabetes patients from a primary care setting. The DMP (intervention) comprised a structured treatment approach with an individual treatment plan, treatment goals and an interprofessional team approach. Our outcome comprehensive measures included quality of life (QOL: EQ-D-L), pre-defined indicators for diabetes guideline adherence, number of used services and direct medical costs. We applied a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to compare DMP with usual care (follow-up  year). Costs were calculated with non-parametric bootstrapping ( Swiss Francs, CHF; conversion rate to Euros: .) from a third-party payer perspective (Swiss health care insurance). Results QOL in a sub-sample of  patients did not change during follow-up (mean utility . at baseline and follow-up; p=.). Guideline adherence showed slight improvements for DMP. For example, non-adherence (baseline DMP: %) decreased in the DMP group by - %-points (DID; %-CI: -. to .) but not in the control group. A general trend emerged, though mostly not statistically significant, with less used services in the DMP group compared to the control group.

These changes include increased levels of lysosomal hydrolases in early endosomes and increased expression of the cation-dependent mannose -phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), which is partially localized to early endosomes. To determine whether AD-associated redistribution of lysosomal hydrolases resulting from changes in CD-MPR expression affects amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, we stably transfected APP-overexpressing murine L cells with human CD-MPR. As controls for these cells, we also expressed CD-MPR trafficking mutants that either localize to the plasma membrane (CD-MPRpm) or to early endosomes (CD-MPRendo). Expression of CD-MPR resulted in a partial redistribution of a representative lysosomal hydrolase, cathepsin D, to early endosomal compartments. Turnover of APP and secretion of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta were not altered by overexpression of any of the CD-MPR constructs. However, secretion of both human Abeta and Abeta into the growth media nearly tripled in CD-MPR- and CD-MPRendo-expressing cells when compared with parental or CD-MPRpm-expressing cells. Comparable increases were confirmed for endogenous mouse Abeta in L cells expressing these CD-MPR constructs but not overexpressing human APP. These data suggest that redistribution of lysosomal hydrolases to early endocytic compartments mediated by increased expression of the CD-MPR may represent a potentially pathogenic mechanism for accelerating Abeta generation in sporadic AD, where the mechanism of amyloidogenesis is unknown.","doc_id":2347,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16542","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Tell me your story and I will tell you who you are : persona perspective in sustainable consumption","authors":"Onel, Naz; Mukherjee, Avinandan; Kreidler, Nicole Bieak; Díaz, Estela M.; Furchheim, Pia; Gupta, Shipra; Keech, Jessica; Murdock, Mitchel R.; Wang, Qin","subject":"Acquisition; Consumer behavior; Personas;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"658.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Tell me your story and I will tell you who you are : persona perspective in sustainable consumption; Acquisition; Consumer behavior; Personas;  Marketingmanagement; Although research in marketing and consumer behavior has tried to portray sustainable consumers in many different ways, a clear, consistent, and granular identification of these consumers is still not available due to the complexity of sustainable consumption.

While CSR is widely considered as “best practice”, its implementation remains limited as CSR requires a new way of conducting business, namely a systematic integration of social, environmental and ethical concerns into business conduct. While large firms face especially great pressures to adopt CSR, they have to undertake substantial efforts to coordinate the translation of CSR into organizational practices and processes. Against this background, this PhD project addresses the question of how large firms implement CSR. By means of an inductive qualitative research approach, the project investigates three different empirical aspects of how large firms implement CSR through an institutional theory lens. First, the focus lies on the CSR management function’s access to resources in the course of CSR implementation. Second, the attempt is made to model the relationship between institutionalization and professionalization in the CSR context. Third, the analysis addresses the industry-specific manifestation of a particular CSR practice, namely Socially Responsible Investing within banks and insurance companies. Based on the empirical insights gained into CSR implementation, the final section of the project aims at conceptually developing a morally reflective institutional theory.; Im Zuge der Debatte um nachhaltige Entwicklung und der Verantwortung, welche Unternehmen dabei tragen, engagieren sich diese vermehrt im Bereich von Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

However, there is a lack of LCIA methods to assess the contribution of fish consumption to the global problem of overfishing, despite that fact that more than two thirds of commercially used fish resources are overexploited. Due to this methodological gap, fish is often determined to have a lower environmental footprint than other sources of animal protein in LCA studies. The aim of this publication is to present the development of eco-factors for fish resources and by-catch as an addition to the Swiss Ecological Scarcity Method  and to compare the eco-factors of different fish resources and the impacts of fishing as well as the impacts of dietary alternatives like chicken, pork, lamb, beef and veal.Materials and Methods: The sustainable use of fish resources ensures that the fish stock for each fish species exceeds the minimum stock needed for a maximum sustainable yield. Therefore, the method developed uses a distance to target approach based on the fish stock for maximum sustainable yield (FSMSY) and the current fish stock (FS) for the characterisation of the use of fish resources. Langlois et al. and Emanuelsson et al. also suggest approaches for the characterisation of overexploitation of fish resources based on the FSMSY. The eco-factors were calculated for each fish species and fishing area. Thereafter, they were aggregated for each fish species using the weighted average of the total catch per fishing area. The target value for FSMSY depends on the fish species and the fishing area. The amount of by-catch was approximated with the dead discard of the walleye pollock (gadus chalcogrammus), which has the highest by-catch rate worldwide. In order to be able to compare the eco-factors for fish resources with the eco-factors of meat production, the factors were corrected from live weight to product weight assuming that the product weight corresponds to  % of live weight and that  % of the economic value is associated with the final product weight.Results and Discussion: The inclusion of eco-factors for the overexploitation of fish resources and by-catch shows a relevant contribution to the total environmental impact of fish compared to other impacts resulting from fishing and fish processing.Depending on the fish species, fish can have significantly higher overall impacts compared with different types of meat. The contribution of the eco-factors for by-catch is minor compared to fish resources but still relevant for the comparison with dietary alternatives. The total contribution of the eco-factors for fish resources exceeds the impacts of the fishery and fish processing.Conclusions: Distance to target based eco-factors using regionalised data for FS and FSMSY not only follow a comparable underlying approach as suggested in literature but also enable aggregation into a single-score with other environmental impacts. The overexploitation of fish resources is highly variable for different fish species and fishing areas as well as for by-catch, which also requires the consideration of by-catch species and fishing method. When comparing fish to equivalent dietary alternatives like chicken, pork, lamb, beef or veal, consideration of the overexploitation of fish resources results in some fish species exceeding the environmental impact of dietary alternatives. Therefore, overexploitation of fish resources is relevant in the Life Cycle Assessment of fish products in different diets. The suggested approach can be integrated in a full single-score LCIA of meals and is able to reflect the regionalised impacts caused by the overexploitation of fish resources for different species and fishing areas as well as the impacts associated with by-catch and fishing method.","doc_id":2473,"prior":"environmental footprint","SDG12":1},{"id":"76","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11751","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Ökobilanz von PVT-Kollektoren","authors":"Koller, Christoph; Stucki, Matthias; Mathez, Stefan A.","subject":"Ökobilanz;  Energie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"333.79","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Ökobilanz von PVT-Kollektoren; Ökobilanz;  Energie; PVT-Hybridkollektoren kombinieren ein Photovoltaikmodul und ein Solarthermie-Kollektor zu einem System.

Yet there is currently no consent on how to assess shape irregularity. The aims of this work are to quantify irregularity as perceived by clinicians, to break down irregularity into morphological attributes, and to relate these to clinically relevant factors such as rupture status, aneurysm location, and patient age or sex.Methods: Thirteen clinicians and  laypersons assessed  aneurysm lumen segmentations in terms of overall perceived irregularity and five different morphological attributes (presence/absence of a rough surface, blebs, lobules, asymmetry, complex geometry of the parent vasculature). We examined rater agreement and compared the ratings with clinical factors by means of regression analysis or binary classification.Results: Using rank-based aggregation, the irregularity ratings of clinicians and laypersons did not differ statistically. Perceived irregularity showed good agreement with curvature (coefficient of determination R = . ± .) and was modeled very accurately using the five morphological rating attributes plus shape elongation (R = . ± .). In agreement with previous studies, irregularity was associated with aneurysm rupture status (AUC = . ± .); adding aneurysm location as an explanatory variable increased the AUC to . ± .. Besides irregularity, perceived asymmetry, presence of blebs or lobules, aneurysm size, non-sphericity, and curvature were linked to rupture. No association was found between morphology and any of patient sex, age, and history of smoking or hypertension. Aneurysm size was linked to morphology.Conclusions: Irregular lumen shape carries significant information on the aneurysm’s disease status. Irregularity constitutes a continuous parameter that shows a strong association with the rupture status. To improve the objectivity of morphological assessment, we suggest examining shape through six different morphological attributes, which can characterize irregularity accurately.","doc_id":2924,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7165","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A touch and pair system for battery-free 802.15.4/ZigBee home automation networks","authors":"Condrau, D.; Zimmerman, L.; Gysel, M.; Wuerms, M.; Meli, Marcel","subject":"RFID; Wireless; Batteryless; Pairing;  Spezielle Computerverfahren","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"006","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"A touch and pair system for battery-free ../ZigBee home automation networks; RFID; Wireless; Batteryless; Pairing;  Spezielle Computerverfahren; In this paper,  problems affecting the acceptance of wireless devices by a wider public are introduced, and possible solutions are suggested.

University students were confronted with abrupt changes by the COVID- lock-down both in their personal and academic lives. The “Health in Students during the Corona pandemic” study (HES-C) investigated the impact on mental health and health behavior, COVID- related behaviors, concerns and views, from the April rd  (T) to January th  (T), covering two university semesters with overall  surveys. Early in the lock-down all students of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (N = ,) were invited to a voluntary longitudinal health survey. The single surveys showed participation rates from T % to T %. Longitudinal data are available for N~ in the spring semester. The workshop will present results on mental health outcomes, anxiety and depression, and health behaviors with a focus on compliance with COVID- measures, health behaviors substance abuse, and address both individual as well as societal and COVID specific factors influencing health during the pandemic.The workshop foresees three short inputs of each  - min. and a discussion at the end of  - min.•\tCovid- related preventive and risky health behavior (Annina Zysset)The input will focus on adherence to containment measures as mean of preventive health behavior, as well health risk behavior of students during the pandemic. While overall adherence was high, men yielded lower adjusted odds (OR; %-CI) of adherence regarding the following measures: social distancing (.; .-.), non-utilization of public transport (.; .-.), -person limit for social gatherings (.; .-.) and the stay at home rule (.; .-.). In addition to gender, factors associated with adherence were information source and perceived susceptibility to the virus. Out of % who reported having drunk alcohol during the last  day, % engaged at least one in binge drinking (> beverages) and % consumed more than usual. % consumed marijuana, of which % consumed more during the lock-down than before. Factors associated with risk behavior and changes in behavior will be presented. Public health communication targeting university students should address both preventive and risk behavior during the pandemic. . •\tGeneralized anxiety (Julia Dratva)The input focusses on the anxiety levels, measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale- (GAD-), and the association of anxiety with perceived personal and academic COVID- impact, and the trend of anxiety across the semester. At T .% showed symptoms of moderate- severe anxiety. A latent class analysis (LCA) yielded three classes varying in perceived COVID- impact:  (low, n = ),  (moderate, n = ), and  (strong, n = ), and a significant increase in the adjusted proportion of moderate to severe anxiety by class with a  fold increase in class  compared to class  (% (% CI: .–.), .% (% CI: .–.), and .% (% CI: .–.). The prevalence of anxiety decreased to .% at T ( weeks later). Concluding, the results imply a generally high COVID related impact on anxiety. Albeit anxiety decreased with time, the diversity of students’ crisis perception and associated anxiety should be addressed in future health promotion and support.•\tDepression (Thomas Volken)The input addresses the prevalence of depressive symptoms, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-), the changes in depressive symptoms between April (T) and October  (T), and associations of protective factors and risk factors with levels of depressive symptoms.  The adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in female (.% (% CI: .-.)) and male students (.% (% CI: .-.) was substantially higher than in a matching pre-pandemic national sample of young women (.% (% CI: .-.)) and men (.% (.-.)). Depressive symptoms between T and T did not decline, despite the Federal Council's significantly relaxed containment measures during late spring and early summer. Overall, our results imply an alarmingly high prevalence of depressive symptoms among students during the pandemic. We identified several factors associated with depressive symptom, which may be used to structure and guide future health promotion and support initiatives.

The aim of this paper is to decompose inpatient care costs in the Swiss canton of Zurich by  diseases and  age/sex groups and to assess the contribution of six factors to the change in aggregate costs between  and . These six factors are population size, age and sex structure, inpatient treated prevalence, utilization in terms of stays per patient, length of stay per case, and costs per treatment day. Using detailed inpatient cost data at the case level, we find that the most important contributor to the change in disease-specific costs was a rise in costs per treatment day. For most conditions, this effect was partly offset by a reduction in the average length of stay. Changes in population size accounted for one third of the total increase, but population structure had only a small positive association with costs. The most expensive cases accounted for the largest part of the increase in costs, but the magnitude of this effect differed across diseases. A better understanding of the factors related to cost changes at the disease level over time is essential for the design of targeted health policies aiming at an affordable health care system.","doc_id":3339,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"91","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16223","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Encrypting high definition video for network transmission using HDCP","authors":"Gelke, Hans-Joachim","subject":"HDCP; Encryption; 2.1; HDMI;  Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Encrypting high definition video for network transmission using HDCP; HDCP; Encryption; .; HDMI;  Informatik; Retransmitting High Bandwidth Digital Contend Protected (HDCP) audio and video through networks requires to adhere to the HDCP standard and a license issued by Digital Content Protection, LLC.

One element in achieving this transition is the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS). NBS can provide a range of ecosystem services beneficial for the urban biosphere such as regulation of micro-climates, flood prevention, water treatment, food provision and more.

Sensors are equipped with a wireless link that allows them to transfer data to other devices or to get information from them. This opens up many applications with high volume potential. The promise of a large market has led to an abundance of Bluetooth Smart solutions, which is a good thing for the consumer. Competition will lead to improved quality and will drive costs down. But there is also the danger of a maintenance nightmare, if questions such as energy consumption and security are not properly addressed. Sensors need a power source and the way this is often done is to use batteries. They are small and low cost. But maintenance of sensors powered by small batteries means finding them (if one can still remember where they are) and changing the batteries. This is both resource consuming and ecologically expensive. Energy harvesting can help bring the needed autonomy, reduce and even eliminate the maintenance issues as far as energy is concerned. So far however, energy harvesting has proved expensive. In this work, we use a new power management system to design a sensor that runs day and night on energy harvested using a very small solar cell.  Part of the energy harvested when there is enough light is stored for use at night.

The system allows us to provide all students with a tool to develop their manual skills, and especially their thrusting technique. As the feedback given by the system can be record ed, progress can be monitored and students can be mentored accurately according to their strengths and weaknesses.","doc_id":3768,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1867","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Condition monitoring with energy harvesting from vibrations","authors":"Gruber, Juan-Mario; Toma, Patrick","subject":" Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"621.3","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Condition monitoring with energy harvesting from vibrations;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; This paper presents a concept for wireless sensor nodes using vibration energy harvesting.

So far the necessary drying was done by thermal methods with high inputs of energy. In this project we investigate hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) as CO saving and cost efficient alternative to dry sewage sludge on industrial scale. The focus in this applied research project is on the process water treatment, the mechanical dewatering, the potential use of HTC coal, the recycling of phosphorus and heavy metals and an assessment of environmental effects of HTC compared to current treatments.The potential for biological decomposition was investigated in HTC process water and permeat, which was gained by membrane filtration of HTC process water. A medium to high decomposition rate was shown for organic matter in HTC process water and permeat by aerobic and anaerobic processes in batch experiments. In a continuous aerobic laboratory reactor the HTC process water and permeat showed decomposition rates of -% for chemical oxygen demand (COD) at a specific load of - kg COD/(m reactor volume*d). In the competition for a HTC-stage at the Oftringen waste water treatment plant (WWTP) an increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) due to the addition of HTC-permeate is limited to  mg/l in the effluent of the WWTP. This value can be reached by an optimised membrane filtration with no further treatment for most cases.Advantages of HTC for the mechanical dewatering were shown with a filter press on industrual scale. HTC coal was successfully burned in mono- and mixed combustion plants on industrial scale, for example at Jura Cement in Wildegg or the sludge combustion plant (SVA) in Winterthur. At SVA additional fossil fuels could be temporarily fully substituted by HTC coal. Additional experiments on industrial scale are planned. No evidence of decreased recycling capability of phosphorus or heavy metals after carbonisation was found.Compared to the currently applied sewage sludge drying process the waste heat could be reduced by up to % and the electricity demand by up to % with HTC. A detailled life cycle assessment showed little differences of HTC compared to the thermal drying process with waste heat but significant advantages compared to the thermal process of drying with fossil fuels. HTC is most promising concerning minimal environmental effects if optimizing measures are applied such as the reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen in the HTC process water, the recycling of phosphorus and the use of lost heat, renewable energy sources such as sewage gas, wood chips, green electricity on adequate sites and if the produced HTC coal is used as substitute of fossil fuels, for example in cement industry or brown coal power plants.Currently a detailled technical study is prepared by AVA-CO and another competitor for the first industrial HTC plant in Switzerland to dry sewage sludge at the WWTP Oftringen.","doc_id":3994,"prior":"life cycle assessment","SDG12":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16487","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The patient perspective of living with Multiple Sclerosis : the Swiss Database of  Patients‘ Narratives","authors":"Glässel, Andrea; Streeck, Nina; Hendriks, Manya; Petry, Heidi; Kesselring, Jürg; Biller-Andorno, Nikola","subject":"Patient perspective; Qualitative research; Multiple Sclerosis; Patient experiences;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"616.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"The patient perspective of living with Multiple Sclerosis : the Swiss Database of  Patients‘ Narratives; Patient perspective; Qualitative research; Multiple Sclerosis; Patient experiences;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Introduction: Listening to patients’ voices is increasingly being recognized as an important factor for continuous improvement in health care. Integrating patients’ stories about their experiences with multiple sclerosis (MS) seems paramount considering the relatively high prevalence of MS and its life-changing consequences for those affected and their families. The Swiss database of patient narratives provides a systematic and methodologically rigorous collection of interviews about the real-life experiences with health issues and presents them as video- and/or audio-sequences on a website. Objective of this study is to describe a wide range of people’s individual experiences of health and disease, to understand what matters to them and to provide a rich information resource for people with MS and for those who look after them. Relevance of the study: This is the first introduction of the project of patients’ experiences with MS in Switzerland. We want to show learning about patients’ perspectives based on qualitative re-search can be beneficial in a variety of ways: A) Improving health care: Narratives provide a valuable source of information on patients’ perspectives that can help improve health care. B) Self-help and patient engagement: People facing similar issues benefit from consulting the website by gaining information and cope with MS more effectively. C) Education: The database of patients’ voices can also be used as a resource in teaching in medical and health professionals to better understand MS patients’ needs and priorities.D) Research: The project contributes to health-related narrative research and offers the opportunity to get involved in this growing field of interprofessional research. Methodology: The project is part of the international DIPEx network, represented by fourteen countries, leaded by UK (www.healthtalk.com). DIPEx works with a well-established and rigorous qualitative research methodology developed by the University of Oxford in . Results: We interviewed Swiss wide  people with multiple sclerosis concerning personal experiences of health and illness, in collaboration with the MS registry of Switzerland.Conclusion: Understanding what is important for patients when they are ill is a crucial prerequisite for the development of patient-relevant outcomes, quality measures, and for identifying opportunities for improvement and best-practice models.","doc_id":4006,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1642","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"A diagnostic tool for improved detection of Xanthomonas fragariae using a rapid and highly specific LAMP assay designed with comparative genomics","authors":"Gétaz, Michael; Bühlmann, Andreas; Schneeberger, Pierre H.

A comparative genomics approach using genomes of different Xanthomonas species and pathovars was applied to identify highly specific targets in the genome of Xanthomonas fragariae, the causal agent of angular leaf spot of strawberry, listed under quarantine regulations in Europe. A reliable and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was designed using a unique marker providing a highly specific and rapid detection, making this technique convenient for on-site detection. Specificity of the designed assay was tested on  culture collection strains of X. fragariae,  strains of other Xanthomonas species and pathovars and  strains of other bacterial genera isolated from strawberry leaves. A detection limit of ^ fg was achieved, approximating  genome copies per reaction. When performing analyses with crude plant material, a consistent lower detection efficiency of ^ CFU ml− was achieved. The LAMP assay designed in this study was adapted to work on crude plant material without any prior extensive extraction steps or incubation period. Moreover, it does not require advanced analytical knowledge or a fully equipped laboratory.

Therefore, we evaluated the predisposing and precipitating risk factors in patients hospitalized with acute and chronic heart disease. Methods and Results: In this observational cohort study, , elderly patients (≥ years) admitted to cardiology wards,  with and  without delirium, were included. The relevant sociodemographic and cardiac- and medical-related clusters were assessed by simple and multiple regression analyses and prediction models evaluating their association with delirium. The prevalence of delirium was .%. The delirious patients were older (mean  vs.  years; p < .) and more often institutionalized prior to admission (. vs. .%, p = .), hospitalized twice as long ( ±  days vs.  ±  days; p < .), and discharged more often to nursing homes (. vs. .%, p < .) or deceased (OR, .; % CI, .-.; p = .).

Because the D-shape of an aneurysm is strongly linked to the underlying formation processes it is very likely that the presence or absence of certain shape features indicate the disease status of the aneurysm. Shape (extracted from medical imaging data) already plays a significant role in the qualitative assessment of the aneurysm by the clinician and has been associated with risk prediction. Still, no consensus exists about which shape features reliably predict instability or whether there exist any that qualify as biomarkers at all. In an effort to find support for the assumption that aneurysm shape carries information about the aneurysm status, we developed a flexible classification pipeline that extracts shape features and tests their applicability.Methods: D models of aneurysms are extracted from medical imaging data (mostly DRA) by a standardized vessel segmentation method. The aneurysm is cut from its parent vessels according to a simple and reproducible cut protocol. Different representations of the D shape that have been suggested by literature are calculated for the extracted aneurysm. So far we have looked at Zernike moments (ZM), their invariants (ZMI) and simple geometry indices such as undulation or non-sphericity. Different feature reduction techniques (for ZMI) and machine-learning methods are applied to find linking patterns between shape features and aneurysm stability. This processing pipeline is applied to a relatively large clinical dataset (ca.  cases), whereas the collection of new cases is an on-going effort. We will present the findings on the latest state of the database.Results: Initial results indicate that the ZMI alone are insufficient to classify aneurysms reliably in terms of rupture or stability status. Because of their global support, ZMI bare a strong dependency on the placement of the cuts. In a preliminary study, ZMI were only slightly superior regarding rupture prediction compared to much simpler geometry indices.Conclusions: We implemented a framework to test the performance of different combinations of shape features and machine learning techniques. While the shape-only representation of an aneurysm does carry information about its disease status, the classification results will benefit from the stratification of the aneurysms in terms of location, size and clinical factors. ","doc_id":4301,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"66","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8399","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Engagement in instrumental activities of daily living, social activities, and use of everyday technology in older adults with and without cognitive impairment","authors":"Nygård, Louise; Kottorp, Anders Börje Mauritz","subject":" Ergotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"615.8515, 616.8","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Engagement in instrumental activities of daily living, social activities, and use of everyday technology in older adults with and without cognitive impairment;  Ergotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Introduction: Little is known about how subtle activity limitations may be manifested and clinically detected in people with mild cognitive impairment, but these people have been found to experience greater challenges with everyday technology use.

Drawing on examples of practical systems that we have designed, built and tested, we will highlight the relevant weak points and show how the associated problems can be solved.","doc_id":4407,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20714","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Active façades : life cycle environmental impacts and savings of photovoltaic power plants integrated into the building envelope","authors":"Itten, René; Stucki, Matthias; Clua Longas, Angela; Cattaneo, Gianluca","subject":"Life cycle assessment; Photovoltaic; Building; Integrated; Facade; Greenhouse gas emission; Perovskite;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"621.3, 690","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Active façades : life cycle environmental impacts and savings of photovoltaic power plants integrated into the building envelope; Life cycle assessment; Photovoltaic; Building; Integrated; Facade; Greenhouse gas emission; Perovskite;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk; . GoalIncreased energy supply from photovoltaics is a main priority in the “Energy Strategy ”. Within the research project “PV: Sustainability, market deployment and interaction to the grid – the impacts of advanced photovoltaic solutions” funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, we analysed different options for the enhanced integration of photovoltaic (PV) technologies into the envelope of Swiss buildings using novel monolithic silicon heterojunction organometallic perovskite tandem cells (SHJ-PSC) with adaptions to improve the visual acceptance. In a joint effort of product developers, architects and scientists, this project aimed at providing pathways for the wide-scale use of PV façade solutions, and developing integrated designs based on emerging high-efficiency module technologies to improve the visual aspect and acceptance of PV systems installed in Switzerland. These so-called active façades using photovoltaic modules to produce electricity can provide a significant contribution to the energy transition away from fossil and nuclear fuels.. MethodsWe compared the environmental impacts of different types of construction for building façades with and without integrated monolithic silicon heterojunction perovskite tandem modules (SHJ-PSC) with improved visual design using a prospective life cycle assessment with a time horizon of . The comparison includes a conventional roughcast façade, a wooden façade, and two different active façades using photovoltaic modules. Furthermore, we compared the environmental impacts caused by the construction of the different façades with the environmental impacts saved due to the electricity produced by the active façades composed of photovoltaic modules. In addition, we analysed the reduction in environmental impact of the building using building-integrated photovoltaics due to substitution of construction materials for the façade or roof.. ResultsThe use of photovoltaic modules as façade or roof will increase the environmental impact of the façade or roof compared to the use of conventional construction materials. However, the environmental impacts over the whole life cycle are significantly reduced due to the PV electricity produced by the building. The environmental impacts of the BIPV façade are about two to three times higher compared to a conventional façade, but the savings due to the electricity produced by the BIPV are five to eight times higher than the impacts of the conventional façade. The use of BIPV panels in the façade of buildings will cause net savings of about  kg CO-eq per square meter over the whole life cycle of BIPV façades, while simultaneously saving  kg CO-eq per square meter of façade for the reduced material demand.","doc_id":4444,"prior":"life cycle assessment","SDG12":1},{"id":"12","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21906","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"The burden of smoking in Switzerland : estimation for 2015 and prognosis until 2050","authors":"Mattli, Renato; Farcher, Renato; Dettling, Marcel; Syleouni, Maria-Eleni; Wieser, Simon","subject":" Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362.1041","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"The burden of smoking in Switzerland : estimation for  and prognosis until ;  Gesundheitsökonomie; Objective:To estimate the burden of smoking in Switzerland for  and predict smoking-related deaths until .Methods:Smoking attributable fractions (SAFs) are calculated based on the prevalence of smoking from the Swiss Health Survey and risk ratios extracted from literature.

These questions were addressed in the project “Green Hospital”.Environmentally speaking, healthcare is the fourth most relevant consumer sector (after food, mobility and housing). However, there have been very few comprehensive environmental assessments of this sector. As a result, it is unclear where the greatest scope for improvement lies and how improvements could be implemented.

It will touch the detection of visual biomarkers with machine learning, present an approach to quantifying rather vaguely defined subjective estimations and demonstrate how visualization helps to detect clinical pathways in high dimensional diagnostic data.","doc_id":5277,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"44","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22383","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"The influence of ozone feedbacks on surface climate following spring arctic ozone depletion","authors":"Friedel, Marina; Chiodo, Gabriel; Stenke, Andrea; Domeisen, Daniela; Muthers, Stefan; Anet, Julien; Peter, Thomas","subject":" Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"551","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The influence of ozone feedbacks on surface climate following spring arctic ozone depletion;  Geologie und Hydrologie; Links between springtime Arctic stratospheric ozone anomalies and anomalous surface weather in the Northern Hemisphere have been found recently. Stratospheric ozone thus provides valuable information which may help to improve seasonal predictability. However, the extent and causality of the ozone-surface climate coupling remain unclear and many state-of-the-art forecast models lack any representation of ozone feedbacks on planetary circulation.We investigate the importance of the ozone-surface climate coupling with two Chemistry Climate Models, contrasting simulations with fully interactive ozone against prescribed zonally averaged climatological ozone under fixed present-day boundary conditions. We focus on springtime Arctic ozone minima and compare subsequent surface patterns in runs with and without interactive ozone, thus rendering a detailed and physically-based quantification of the stratospheric ozone impact on surface climate possible.  All model simulations show a connection between Arctic ozone minima and a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in the month after the depletion in spring. Runs with interactive ozone chemistry show an amplified surface response and a % stronger Arctic Oscillation index after ozone depletion. This amplified Arctic Oscillation goes along with enhanced positive surface temperature anomalies over Eurasia. Moreover, composite surface patterns after spring ozone minima in model simulations with interactive ozone show a better agreement with composites in reanalysis data compared to runs with prescribed ozone.Mechanisms whereby stratospheric ozone affects both the stratospheric and tropospheric circulation are explored. These include the reduction of short-wave heating over the pole due to ozone loss, thus amplifying stratospheric temperature anomalies and allowing for an intensification of the polar vortex with subsequent impacts on wave propagation and the stratospheric meridional circulation. This suggests that ozone is not only passively responding to stratospheric dynamics, but actively feeds back into the circulation. Following these results, stratospheric ozone anomalies actively contribute to anomalous surface weather in spring, emphasizing the potential importance of interactive ozone chemistry for seasonal predictions.","doc_id":5291,"prior":"ozone depletion","SDG12":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15286","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Ökobilanzen von Hirsch- und Straussenfleisch","authors":"Brügger, Sara; Bühler, Pascal","subject":"Strauss; Hirsch; Ökobilanz; Gehegewild; Wildfleisch; Wirkungsbilanz; Life cycle analysis; Ostrich; Deer; Schweiz; Switzerland; Neuseeland; New Zealand; Südafrika; South Africa; Import; Fleisch; Meat; Sachbilanz; Allokation;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Weltwirtschaft und Handel","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333, 337","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Ökobilanzen von Hirsch- und Straussenfleisch; Strauss; Hirsch; Ökobilanz; Gehegewild; Wildfleisch; Wirkungsbilanz; Life cycle analysis; Ostrich; Deer; Schweiz; Switzerland; Neuseeland; New Zealand; Südafrika; South Africa; Import; Fleisch; Meat; Sachbilanz; Allokation;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Weltwirtschaft und Handel; With an inland production of only . % game is imported proportionate much compared to other meat (inland production . %).

The concept of defining clinically relevant classifications of disease or ‘target condition’ is used in diagnostic research. Applying this concept to LSI we hypothesize that a set of clinical and radiological criteria can be developed to identify patients with this target condition who are at high risk of ‘irreversible’ decompensated LSI for whom surgery becomes the treatment of choice. In LSI, structural deterioration of the lumbar disc initiates a degenerative cascade of segmental instability. Over time, radiographic signs become visible: traction spurs, facet joint degeneration, misalignment, stenosis, olisthesis and de novo scoliosis. Ligaments, joint capsules, local and distant musculature are the functional elements of the lumbar motion segment. Influenced by non-functional factors, these functional elements allow a compensation of degeneration of the motion segment. Compensation may happen on each step of the degenerative cascade but cannot reverse it. However, compensation of LSI may lead to an alleviation or resolution of clinical symptoms. In return, the target condition of decompensation of LSI may cause the new occurrence of symptoms and pain. Functional compensation and decompensation are subject to numerous factors that can change which makes estimation of an individual’s long-term prognosis difficult. Compensation and decompensation may influence radiographic signs of degeneration, e.g. the degree of misalignment and segmental angulation caused by LSI is influenced by the tonus of the local musculature. This conceptual model of compensation/decompensation may help solve the debate on functional and psychosocial factors that influence low back pain and to establish a new definition of non-specific low back pain. Individual differences of identical structural disorders could be explained by compensated or decompensated LSI leading to changes in clinical symptoms and pain. Future spine surgery will have to carefully define and measure functional aspects of LSI, e.g. to identify a point of no return where multidisciplinary interventions do not allow a re-compensation and surgery becomes the treatment of choice.","doc_id":5386,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21058","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe : Leberzirrhose - Einflussfaktoren auf die Adhärenz und Selbstmanagement-fördernde Interventionen","authors":"Tuttner, Surija; Wicky, Marco","subject":"Liver disease; Cirrhosis; Self-efficacy; Self-management; Adherence; Compliance; Self-care; Education;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"616","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe : Leberzirrhose - Einflussfaktoren auf die Adhärenz und Selbstmanagement-fördernde Interventionen; Liver disease; Cirrhosis; Self-efficacy; Self-management; Adherence; Compliance; Self-care; Education;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Hintergrund: An Leberzirrhose zu erkranken, ist ein häufiger Grund für eine Hospitalisation.

D models of aneurysms are extracted from medical imaging data (mostly D rotational angiography) using a standardized vessel segmentation protocol. A variety of established representations of the D shape are calculated for the extracted aneurysm segment.

This processing pipeline was applied to a clinical dataset of approximately  aneurysms registered in the AneurysmDataBase (SwissNeuroFoundation and AneuriskWeb database.Classification based on ZMI alone allowed us to distinguish between sidewall and bifurcation aneurysms, but failed to forecast an aneurysm’s rupture status reliably. Remarkably, simpler geometry indices performed similarly well in rupture status prediction.

A driving force is the continuing degradation of the environment in many areas of the world, often caused or accelerated by population growth and climate change. Sustainable development is seen as key approach to mitigate these processes. It has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” But how can this ambitious goal be achieved in the light of numerous global challenges? Engineering is a very influential human practice and must be addressed in this context. Engineers are crucially involved in design and construction of our built environment and thus in shaping almost its entire development. However, when designing a solution for a given problem, effects caused outside of the system borders are often not considered. If this is combined with a narrowly confined linear problem-solving approach, it is inherently prone to create new environmental challenges. We postulate that the development of a new design paradigm for engineering must be part of the progress towards sustainable development. We think that this new paradigm needs to integrate a sound understanding of ecological principles, processes, and interdependencies as well as thorough system thinking. We call this ecology-inspired approach to engineering “ecological engineering” and redefine it as follows: Ecological Engineering integrates ecological principles, processes, and organisms with existing engineering practice to a holistic approach for problem-solving. In this paper, we explore the historical development of earlier definitions of Ecological Engineering in the light of their underlying value systems. Based on this analysis, we propose a new conceptual approach for Ecological Engineering and define seven principles that point the way towards a future label that can be conferred to Good Ecological Engineering Practice.","doc_id":5910,"prior":"circular economy","SDG12":1},{"id":"23","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9487","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Recycling under a Material Balance Constraint","authors":"Pittel, Karen; Amigues, Jean-Pierre; Kuhn, Thomas","subject":" Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Recycling under a Material Balance Constraint;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; In this paper we analyze the dynamic implications of recycling for resource use, the level of economic activity and the long-run development of the economy.

Beside the identification of environmental hotspots and mitigation possibilities, the focus of the study was on the analysis and comparison of different refill offers. The results of the study show that one hair wash using the investigated shampoo is related to greenhouse gas emissions of  g COeq. For all investigated impact categories, the use phase represents the dominant life stage, except for land use, which is dominated by the production of the purely plant-based shampoo ingredients. The environmental impact related to the use phase is highly sensitive on the consumers’ showering habits, such as water consumption and water temperature, due to predominantly fossil-based heating in Zurich. On the producer’s side, a switch to renewable energy sources both for heating and electricity is identified as most effective measure to reduce the environmental impact of the manufacturing phase. As to the product end-of-life, the results suggest that emissions of the shampoo ingredients after wastewater treatment have a negligible impact on freshwater ecotoxicity. In this context, a need for further research is identified with respect to characterization factors and specific removal rates in wastewater treatment plants. From a life cycle perspective, packaging production and disposal have rather low contributions. Offering refill possibilities can reduce the packaging related contributions by several percentage points, however, higher mitigation potentials are found for use phase and manufacturing.","doc_id":5989,"prior":"life cycle assessment","SDG12":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8411","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Using a screening tool to evaluate potential use of e-health services for older people with and without cognitive impairment","authors":"Malinowsky, Camilla; Nygård, Louise; Kottorp, Anders","subject":"Telemedicine;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362, 616.8","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Using a screening tool to evaluate potential use of e-health services for older people with and without cognitive impairment; Telemedicine;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Objectives: E-health services are increasingly offered to provide clients with information and a link to healthcare services. The aim of this study is to investigate the perceived access to and the potential to use technologies important for e-health services among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls.Method: The perceived access to and perception of difficulty in the use of everyday technology (such as cell phones, coffee machines, computers) was investigated in a sample of older adults (n = ) comprising three subsamples: adults with MCI (n = ), with mild AD (n = ), and controls (n = ) using the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ). The use of seven technologies important for e-health services was specifically examined for each subsample and compared between the subsamples.Results: The findings demonstrated that the older adults in all subsamples perceive access to e-health technologies and potentially would use them competently in several e-health services.

Such occurrences have shaped Social Media in recent years from a networking platform to a multi-million-dollar business platform. Every day, thousands of pictures and videos of a seemingly perfect life are uploaded with one major goal: influencing the consumers in a way to generate sales for the nutritional supplement industry. One group of individuals that is considered to be highly affected by it, is the Generation Y, due to their digital affinity and high presence on Social Media. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the consumer of nutritional supplements and extent that Social Media has on the consumer behavior of nutritional supplements based on the various areas of the consumer buying cycle.The analysis has shown that the consumer behavior differs when nutritional supplements are purchased under the influence of Social Media. Not only is it able to change the perception and opinion towards nutritional supplements in a positive way, it also influences the consumer in the way nutritional supplements are purchased. It was found out that the main purpose for supplementation are deficits in nutrition and weight control and that Social Media is able to generate sales if detailed information about products are provided, as well as positive reviews are given. A key driver for the selection of the product was stated to be the product quality, followed by the value for money. Lastly, there were indications that the increased usage of Social Media would influence the expenditures and consumption frequency of supplements, however, these could not be identified to be statistically significant. Furthermore, it can be said that Social Media and its business channels and influencers are able to act as opinion leaders and influencers in the field of nutritional supplements.The analysis of this paper was conducted with the use of an internet based survey consisting of quantitative and qualitative research instruments and achieved  total participants through snowball sampling. The survey included two groups of individuals for the comparative analysis, a control group (n=) that has never purchased supplements through Social Media before and a research group that has purchased dietary supplements influenced by such platforms (n=).Under to the prevailing circumstances, it is recommended that companies active in the nutritional supplement industry do in fact establish active presence on Social Media. It is of importance for them to produce quality products at a reasonable price and provide the consumers detailed information about such and to place them with the use of Social Media influencers that can act as opinion leaders. Also, it is recommended to establish direct connections to online shops for the purchase of nutritional supplements, as they were found to be the main place of purchase in connection with such platforms.","doc_id":6136,"prior":"consumer behavior","SDG12":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18105","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts","authors":"Stucki, Matthias; Wettstein, Sarah; Amrein, Simon; Mathis, Alex","subject":"LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts; LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Goal: Peat extraction leads to environmental damage in terms of climate and biodiversity. In Switzerland, peat bogs have been protected since  and no peat is currently extracted. However, Switzerland imports an estimated ’ m of peat per year. In order to reduce environmental damage abroad as well, the Federal Council adopted a peat phase-out concept in .The Institute of Natural Resource Sciences of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) assessed the environmental sustainability of various peat substitutes as well as their characteristics, availability and social impacts. Among other products, coconut fibres, cocopeat, bark compost, wood fibres, wood chippings, and TEFA maize fibres were investigated. A follow-up study aimed at further promoting the termination of peat use by extending the study with additional peat alternatives. These are biochar, miscanthus, flax and hemp fibres, grain husks, and coal compost.Methods: The present research project is intended to provide a picture of the environmental impacts of individual substrates and substrate mixtures by means of life cycle assessment, whereby the entire life cycle (raw material extraction, substrate production, transport, use, end-of-life) is taken into account. The substrate components and substrate mixtures are also being evaluated in particular with regard to their crop cultivation properties and medium- to long-term availability for Switzerland. In addition, the study also considers social criteria, which are assessed qualitatively. Finally, the study will provide recommendations for horticulture and, in particular, for producers of ornamental plants, perennials and vegetables.Results: All substrate components exhibit both positive and negative properties with respect to the criteria investigated. Replacing peat with local products such as miscanthus, hemp and flax fibres, wood fibres, TEFA maize fibres or bark compost significantly reduces the emissions of extraction, transport and use of peat. With regard to ecological and social aspects, bark compost, TEFA maize fibres, wood fibres, wood chippings and husks perform very well. As these products are expected to be available in the future, their use as peat substitutes is highly recommended.The availability of wood fibres and wood chippings depends on the price of the energy industry and is therefore subject to fluctuations. Hemp and flax fibres, husks, TEFA maize fibres, and bark compost, on the other hand, hardly compete with energy use. These products are therefore expected to be readily available for horticulture in the future and can be manufactured without significant negative ecological and social impacts.The coconut-based substrate components are associated with higher environmental impacts and social risks than locally manufactured products. On the contrary, the social impacts of production and processing of peat substitutes are assumed to be very low or non-existent in Switzerland. Biochar can be produced locally with readily available substrates and has similar consistency and properties to peat, making it an attractive peat alternative.Environmental impact of peat substitutes are lowest if they are locally produced and processed with low material and energy consumption, when few pesticides and fertilisers have been used in agricultural cultivation and no thermal processing is necessary after harvesting.

This study aimed to identify aspects that influence the ability to manage ET among older adults with and without cognitive impairment.Methods: Older adults with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment and without known cognitive impairment were assessed as they managed their ET at home. Data were collected using the Management of Everyday Technology Assessment (META). Rasch-based measures of the person's ability to manage ET were analyzed. These measures were used as dependent variables in backward procedure ANOVA analyses. Different predefined aspects that could influence the ability to manage ET were used as independent variables.Results: Three aspects had a significant effect upon the ability to manage ET. These were: () variability in intrapersonal capacities (such as “the capacity to pay attention and focus”, () environmental characteristics (such as “the impact of the design”) and () diagnostic group.Conclusions: Variability in intrapersonal capacities seems to be of more importance than the actual level of intrapersonal capacity in relation to the ability to manage ET for this sample. This implies that investigations of ability to manage ET should also include intraperson variability. Additionally, adaptations in environmental characteristics could simplify the management of ET to support older adults as technology users.","doc_id":6297,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7175","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Advertising position with battery-less Bluetooth low energy","authors":"Meli, Marcel; Wuerth, Michael","subject":" Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Advertising position with battery-less Bluetooth low energy;  Informatik; One application of the modern mobile phone is navigation.

Both pathovars share a complex population structure, represented by different clusters and several clades. Here we describe our current understanding of symptomatology, population dynamics, epidemiology, and disease control.Taxonomic status: Bacteria; Phylum Proteobacteria; Class Gammaproteobacteria; Order Lysobacterales (earlier synonym of Xanthomonadales); Family Lysobacteraceae (earlier synonym of Xanthomonadaceae); Genus Xanthomonas; Species X. arboricola; Pathovars: pv. juglandis and pv. corylina.Host range and symptoms: The host range of each pathovar is not limited to a single species, but each infects mainly one plant species: Juglans regia (X. arboricola pv. juglandis) and Corylus avellana (X. arboricola. pv. corylina). Walnut bacterial blight is characterized by lesions on leaves and fruits, and cankers on twigs, branches, and trunks; brown apical necrosis symptoms consist of apical necrosis originating at the stigmatic end of the fruit. A peculiar symptom, the vertical oozing canker developing along the trunk, is elicited by a particular genetic lineage of the bacterium. Symptoms of hazelnut bacterial blight are visible on leaves and fruits as necrotic lesions, and on woody parts as cankers. A remarkable difference is that affected walnuts drop abundantly, whereas hazelnuts with symptoms do not.Distribution: Bacterial blight of walnut has a worldwide distribution, wherever Persian (English) walnut is cultivated; the bacterial blight of hazelnut has a more limited distribution, although disease outbreaks are currently more frequently reported. X. arboricola pv. juglandis is regulated almost nowhere, whereas X. arboricola pv. corylina is regulated in most European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) countries.Epidemiology and control: For both pathogens infected nursery material is the main pathway for their introduction and spread into newly cultivated areas; additionally, infected nursery material is the source of primary inoculum. X. arboricola pv. juglandis is also disseminated through pollen. Disease control is achieved through the phytosanitary certification of nursery material (hazelnut), although approved certification schemes are not currently available. Once the disease is present in walnut/hazelnut groves, copper compounds are widely used, mostly in association with dithiocarbamates; where allowed, antibiotics (preferably kasugamycin) are sprayed. The emergence of strains highly resistant to copper currently represents the major threat for effective management of the bacterial blight of walnut.","doc_id":6669,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16746","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Ein Stein, der mir Flügel macht","authors":"Rieder, Evelyn","subject":" Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Rezension","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Ein Stein, der mir Flügel macht;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Auf eindrückliche Weise schildert die Autorin Regula Meier, wie ihre Familie die Krebsdiagnose der ältesten Tochter erlebt.

Holistic treatment includes control of symptoms (e. g., pain, nausea, sleeplessness) as well as psychosocial and spiritual help which is also extended to the relatives of a patient. For advanced cancer patients in palliative care, a crucial phase is the transition from palliative care in the hospital to the home setting, where care around the clock is not guaranteed any more, leads to an increased number of unplanned hospital re-admissions and emergency visits. Physicians aim to fill this care gap by monitoring physical and social activities as well as vital signs. Daily monitoring data, provided to caregivers, could enable caregivers to timely intervene when symptoms of a patient deteriorate. Besides patients in palliative care, also cancer survivors suffering from cancer-related fatigue could benefit from activity monitoring. Up to now, the remedies and effective treatments for cancer-related fatigue are limited. Research still has to unveil the underlying mechanisms that lead to a state of chronic exhaustedness.  Measures that help healthy people like regenerative sleep show no or little effect in fatigued patients. Besides psycho-stimulants that come with the risk of addiction, cognitive behavioural therapy and moderate physical exercise have been shown to be effective. However, research still has to investigate timing, frequency and intensity of physical activity and researchers need a better understanding how the fatigue evolves during the day and in long-term.This thesis investigates the possibilities and limitations of activity monitoring using wearable devices such as smartphones and an armworn devices that is capable of measuring vital signs such as heart rate. Three studies involving cancer patients are conducted:- An interview study including  cancer patients enabled a patient-centric design for an Android activity monitoring app for smartphones.- Only using the smartphone as monitoring device, a study with  cancer survivors suffering from cancer-related fatigue was conducted as a pre-study in order to gain first experiences and to explore the possible knowledge gain about cancer-related fatigue through activity monitoring.- During a planned study period of  weeks per patient,  patients in ambulatory palliative care were wearing a smartphone and the arm-worn sensor as monitoring devices. The age range of the study participants was  to  years. In weekly interviews, patients were asked about their experiences with the devices and their quality of life. The aim of the study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptance of activity monitoring in this patient group.Furthermore, exploratory data analysis investigated the possibilities and limitations of unsupervised methods on this real-world data set. The two data sets, collected during the fatigue study and during the palliative care study, were pre-processed including cleaning steps, classification and clustering methods to add higher level information such as visited locations (anonymized). From these prepared data sets, features were extracted such as number of places visited per day. On the resulting datasets of features, statistical methods were applied to explore relations between sensor data, self-reports and, in case of the palliative care study, emergency visits to the hospital. For the latter analysis, patients who experienced an emergency room visit and those who did not were compared by means of hypothesis testing. For each feature, the underlying alternative hypothesis was that the change of a feature between the first week of study participation at home and the week before an emergency visit (or the last week of study participation for the patients without an emergency visit), differs in the two patient groups. The rate of change was defined by the ratio of the medians of the two weeks. Changes of three features, namely resting heart rate, resting heart rate variability and step speed were identified to have significant group differences:- The resting heart rate had an increasing trend in the group with emergency visits (median=., interquartile range [., .]) and a decreasing trend in the group without an emergency visit (median=., interquartile range [., .]) with a nominal significance of p=. and a medium effect size r=.. - The resting heart rate variability had a decreasing trend in the group with emergency visits (mean=., standard deviation=.) and an increasing trend in the group without an emergency visit (mean=., standard deviation=.) with a nominal significance of p=. and a large effect size r=.. - The step speed had an increasing trend in the group with emergency visits (median=., interquartile range [., .]) and a decreasing trend in the group without an emergency visit (median=., interquartile range [., .]) with a nominal significance of p=. and a large effect size r=..In contrast, hypothesis testing for features based on patients’ subjective self-reports for pain, distres and global quality of life did not reveil any significant differences. Hence, activity monitoring of vital signs and physical activity outperformed patients’ self-reports. However, a power analysis based on the three nominally significant results would recommend an independent study with  patients to confirm the results of this study. Furthermore, a set of recommendations for future research was concluded from the experiences gained through conducting these studies.","doc_id":6704,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21647","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Multidimensional content modeling and caching in D2D edge networks","authors":"Kafıloğlu, S.

That evolution requires a remedial shift from the connection-oriented architecture to a content-centric one. Another technique to address this capacity crunch is to improve spectral utilization through new networking paradigms at the wireless network edge. To this end, Device-to-Device (DD) communications has the potential for boosting the capacity and energy efficiency for content-centric networking. To design and implement efficient content-centric DD networks, rigorous content modeling and in-network caching mechanisms based on such models are crucial. In this work, we develop a multidimensional content model based on popularity, chunking and layering, and devise caching schemes through this model. Our main motivation is to improve the system performance via our caching strategies. The numerical analysis shows the interplay among different system parameters and performance metrics: while our schemes perform slightly poorer in terms of system goodput, they also decrease the system energy expenditure. Overall, this improvement dominates the loss in the goodput, leading to greater energy efficiency compared to the commonly-used caching technique Least Recently Used (LRU).","doc_id":6723,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23377","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Consumers’ knowledge gain through a cross-category environmental label","authors":"Dihr, Marius; Berthold, Anne; Siegrist, Michael; Sütterlin, Bernadette","subject":"Environmental label; Sustainable product; Consumer communication; Consumer preference and attitude;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 658.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Consumers’ knowledge gain through a cross-category environmental label; Environmental label; Sustainable product; Consumer communication; Consumer preference and attitude;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Marketingmanagement; Consumers' food choices play a crucial role in the shift toward increased sustainability.

Integrating patients’ stories about their experiences with multiple sclerosis (MS) seems paramount considering the relatively high prevalence of MS and its life-changing consequences for those affected and their families. The Swiss database of patient narratives provides a systematic and methodologically rigorous collection of interviews about the real-life experiences with health issues and presents them as video- and/or audio-sequences on a website. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to describe a wide range of people’s indi-vidual experiences of health and disease, to understand what matters to them and to provide a rich information resource for people affected by these diseases and for those who look after them. It will furthermore include the perspective of health care professionals. A secondary study objective is examining the contexts in which illness and health behaviours take place, and seeks to understand how society, self and physical bodies, shape experience of illness. Relevance of the study: This is the first introduction of the project of patients’ experiences in Switzerland. Results will be presented at a later stage. In this phase, we want to show learning about patients’ perspectives based on qualitative research can be beneficial in a variety of ways: A) Improving health care: Narratives provide a valuable source of information on patients’ perspectives that can help improve health care. Based on qualitative interview data, the project generates scientific information on what matters to patients with MS through the course of their disease and about what strengths and deficiencies they perceive in the health care system. Understanding what is important for patients when they are ill is a crucial prerequisite for the development of patient-relevant outcomes, quality measures, and for identifying opportunities for improvement and best-practice models. Including qualitative data into health services research can complement the use of empirical data as they are gathered, for example, through the MS registry by exploring patients’ experiences in greater depth and by pointing out underexplored themes that wait to be addressed. Concrete suggestions on poten-tial advances of health care services can be expected. B) Self-help and patient engagement: People facing similar issues benefit from consulting the website by gaining information and support which may help them to live and cope with MS and use their social healthcare resources more effectively. Not only will they find information on scientific facts about their disease but primarily gain insight into the personal experiences of others affected by MS. They may, for example, get to know how other patients get along with their illness in their daily activities, why they made certain choices about their medical treatment, or where to find proper support. That way, patients get the chance and might be motivated to increasingly become engaged in their own health.C) Education: The database not only strengthens patients’ voices in policy discourses but can also be used as a resource in teaching and continued medical education as it can help health professionals to better understand MS patients’ needs and priorities and close the gap between what really matters to the individual patient and what the physician perceives and treats. A better knowledge of patients’ preferences may affect a patient-oriented care.D) Research: The project contributes to health-related narrative research and offers junior researchers from medicine and health care professions the opportunity to get involved in this growing field of research. The data can be a valuable basis either for subsequent quantitative studies or for further (secondary) qualitative analyses to address emerging themes in greater detail. Methodology: The project participates in the international DIPEx network, currently repre-senting twelve countries, among them the UK (www.healthtalk.com) and Germany (www.krankheitserfahrungen.de). DIPEx works with a well-established and rigorous qualita-tive research methodology developed by the University of Oxford in . Interviews with  to  people for each health condition, e.g.  multiple sclerosis, are conducted, concerning personal experiences of health and illness. The project aims at continuously broadening the spectrum of issues being researched and presented on the Swiss DIPEx website.","doc_id":6884,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20879","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Kognitive Interventionen bei Menschen mit Demenz : die Effektivität von drei kognitiven Interventionsansätzen bezogen auf die Handlungsfähigkeit und deren Anwendung in der Ergotherapie","authors":"Kirsch, Thea; Limacher, Chantal","subject":"Dementia; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive rehabilitation; Cognitive stimulation; Cognitive training; ADL; IADL;  Ergotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.8515, 616.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Kognitive Interventionen bei Menschen mit Demenz : die Effektivität von drei kognitiven Interventionsansätzen bezogen auf die Handlungsfähigkeit und deren Anwendung in der Ergotherapie; Dementia; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive rehabilitation; Cognitive stimulation; Cognitive training; ADL; IADL;  Ergotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Darstellung des Themas: Menschen mit Demenz sind in ihrer Handlungsfähigkeit eingeschränkt.

In -% of all LBP patients, symptoms are attributed as nonspecific LBP (NSLBP). Attempts to identify effective interventions for people with NSLBP have often been unsuccessful. Past studies often treated NSLBP as a homogenous entity, although many clinicians notice distinguishable subgroups in daily practice. Valid classification systems are needed and are priority for primary care of LBP patients. A basic component of many contemporary LBP classification systems is the examination of lumbopelvic and postural kinematics. This examination is problematic because simple measurement systems such as visual observation or goniometers lack accuracy, reliability, validity, comprehensiveness, and practicality. To overcome these limitations this doctoral thesis introduces a novel, wireless movement-analysis system based on inertial measurement units (IMUs). In using the novel IMU system, the aims of the studies conducted in this thesis were to assess: The concurrent validity of lumbopelvic kinematics (Study I), the reliability of lumbopelvic kinematics (Study II), the associations between NSLBP intensity and lumbopelvic kinematics (Study III), the associations between fatigue and NSLBP with non-linear lumbopelvic kinematics (Study IV), and the effect of exercise therapy on non-linear lumbopelvic kinematics (Study V).Studies I-IV were conducted at a movement laboratory. Asymptomatic controls and subjects with nonspecific LBP performed a series of lumbar movement tests, from which indices of lumbopelvic kinematics (e.g. range of motion, movement variability and complexity) were calculated. The concurrent validity of the IMU-system was tested against an optoelectronic system. The reliability of lumbopelvic kinematics was analysed by comparing repeated measures over two days. To analyse the association between NSLBP intensity and lumbopelvic kinematics participants with different levels of NSLBP intensity performed movement tests. To investigate the effect of fatigue and NSLBP participants performed a movement test prior and after fatiguing of the lumbar musculature. The effect of exercise therapy was investigated in a randomized controlled trial in study V: After randomization, the intervention group was treated twice a week for six months while the control group only attended the measurement sessions. Follow-up measurements were taken at post treatment and at twelve months follow-up.The IMU system is concurrently valid to measure lumbopelvic kinematics in the primary movement direction. However, the system appears less valid for assessing movements in non-primary directions. On average, measures of lumbar range of motion, movement variability and complexity are more reliable compared to measures of movement control impairments and reposition error. NSLBP intensity affects lumbopelvic kinematics, so that participants with higher intensity NSLBP showed more variable and less predictable lumbar movement. Fatigue affects lumbopelvic kinematics, and this effect depends on the presence of NSLBP.

In -% of all LBP patients, symptoms are attributed as nonspecific LBP (NSLBP). Attempts to identify effective interventions for people with NSLBP have often been unsuccessful. Past studies often treated NSLBP as a homogenous entity, although many clinicians notice distinguishable subgroups in daily practice. Valid classification systems are needed and are priority for primary care of LBP patients. A basic component of many contemporary LBP classification systems is the examination of lumbopelvic and postural kinematics. This examination is problematic because simple measurement systems such as visual observation or goniometers lack accuracy, reliability, validity, comprehensiveness, and practicality. To overcome these limitations this doctoral thesis introduces a novel, wireless movement-analysis system based on inertial measurement units (IMUs). In using the novel IMU system, the aims of the studies conducted in this thesis were to assess: The concurrent validity of lumbopelvic kinematics (Study I), the reliability of lumbopelvic kinematics (Study II), the associations between NSLBP intensity and lumbopelvic kinematics (Study III), the associations between fatigue and NSLBP with non-linear lumbopelvic kinematics (Study IV), and the effect of exercise therapy on non-linear lumbopelvic kinematics (Study V).Studies I-IV were conducted at a movement laboratory. Asymptomatic controls and subjects with nonspecific LBP performed a series of lumbar movement tests, from which indices of lumbopelvic kinematics (e.g. range of motion, movement variability and complexity) were calculated. The concurrent validity of the IMU-system was tested against an optoelectronic system. The reliability of lumbopelvic kinematics was analysed by comparing repeated measures over two days. To analyse the association between NSLBP intensity and lumbopelvic kinematics participants with different levels of NSLBP intensity performed movement tests. To investigate the effect of fatigue and NSLBP participants performed a movement test prior and after fatiguing of the lumbar musculature. The effect of exercise therapy was investigated in a randomized controlled trial in study V: After randomization, the intervention group was treated twice a week for six months while the control group only attended the measurement sessions. Follow-up measurements were taken at post treatment and at twelve months follow-up.The IMU system is concurrently valid to measure lumbopelvic kinematics in the primary movement direction. However, the system appears less valid for assessing movements in non-primary directions. On average, measures of lumbar range of motion, movement variability and complexity are more reliable compared to measures of movement control impairments and reposition error. NSLBP intensity affects lumbopelvic kinematics, so that participants with higher intensity NSLBP showed more variable and less predictable lumbar movement. Fatigue affects lumbopelvic kinematics, and this effect depends on the presence of NSLBP. The painfree participants showed more complex and less predictable lumbar movement after an isometric endurance test than participants suffering from LBP. Painfree people might adjust to fatigue by reducing load on fatigued tissues while preserving task performance. Exercise therapy affects lumbopelvic kinematics, and when compared to no intervention it may reverse or reduce deterioration of lumbar movement control, by increasing or preserving the degree of movement variability. As a conclusion, this thesis identified concurrently valid and reliable indices of lumbopelvic kinematics related to nonspecific NSLBP.

In order to apply this principle to the municipal solid waste management three questions are discussed: (i) who are the polluters, (ii) what are the costs they have to pay, (iii) and where should these costs be imposed on the polluters? The determination of the polluter is mainly a juridical problem while the two other questions lie in the center of economic theory. The imposition of the total social costs of waste disposal is theoretical/y convincing but practically not feasible. Therefore another approach is chosen: the costs to be internalized are the costs that result from reaching a politically set environmental standard. lt is argued that for an efficient compliance with this standard it is not enough to intemalize the operational costs of waste treatment.

Results and Discussion: The results of circular industry systems facilitated by the National Industrial Symbiosis Program (NISP) in the United Kingdom show a substantial reduction in the consumption of resources and generation of emissions compared to linear systems. Nevertheless, if there is a plethora of different types of waste, there is also a plethora of different synergies.

A transformation such as the reuse of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can lead to emissions or require additional auxiliary materials as well as transportation. Therefore, the potential benefit will never be equal to the total impact of the primary input because of the transformation stage and the associated environmental impacts of collection and beneficiation. We analysed the implications of the transformation of different waste types to resources when industries are located in different geographic locations under consideration of the life cycle stage of transformation.

Waste PET can be transported up to   km by lorry and still provide a net benefit regarding greenhouse gas emissions due to circular use. However, in case of concrete, the results are very different.

Melting glaciers, less snowfall in many regions and rock fall due to thawing permafrost have a direct impact on athletes and businesses around mountain sports.

We examined the life cycle environmental impact of climbing ropes, from the production chain to the usage and the disposal, produced and sold by the Mammut Sports Group. In addition to the global warming potential (GWP) using the IPCC  method, other impact categories, such as eutrophication or acidification, were assessed using the environmental footprint method. Furthermore, a socio-economic research methodology was used with an online survey in order to obtain data on the rope use and its end-of-life phase, as well as to evaluate the potential of a rope material recycling project by Mammut. The recycled polyamide can be reused for non-personal protective equipment products, such as T-shirts.The results show that the production of the base material polyamide  has at % the highest impact on the total GWP of . kg CO-eq. per climbing rope with m length and a weight of . kg. The raw material production dominates also most other environmental impact categories. Considering the rest of the production chain, the rope processing contributes % to the GWP. The emissions are caused by energy intensive processes such as braiding and twining, powered mainly by coal-based electricity. A switch to photovoltaic electricity could reduce the GWP of this supply chain process by %. The survey indicated a high willingness of climbers to return their ropes for the purpose of recycling.

While phylogenetic and transmission tree inferences provide valuable insight into possible transmission chains, phylodynamic inference combines evolutionary and epidemiological analyses to estimate the parameters of the underlying epidemiological processes, allowing us to describe the overall dynamics of disease spread in the population. In this study, we introduce an approach to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) phylodynamic analysis employing an existing computationally efficient model to quantify the transmission fitness costs of drug resistance with respect to drug-sensitive strains. To determine the accuracy and precision of our approach, we first perform a simulation study, mimicking the simultaneous spread of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains. We analyse the simulated transmission trees using the phylodynamic multi-type birth-death model (MTBD, (Kühnert et al., )) within the BEAST framework and show that this model can estimate the parameters of the epidemic well, despite the simplifying assumptions that MTBD makes compared to the complex TB transmission dynamics used for simulation. We then apply the MTBD model to an M. tuberculosis lineage  dataset that primarily consists of MDR sequences. Some of the MDR strains additionally exhibit resistance to pyrazinamide – an important first-line anti-tuberculosis drug. Our results support the previously proposed hypothesis that pyrazinamide resistance confers a transmission fitness cost to the bacterium, which we quantify for the given dataset. Importantly, our sensitivity analyses show that the estimates are robust to different prior distributions on the resistance acquisition rate, but are affected by the size of the dataset – i.e. we estimate a higher fitness cost when using fewer sequences for analysis. Overall, we propose that MTBD can be used to quantify the transmission fitness cost for a wide range of pathogens where the strains can be appropriately divided into two or more categories with distinct properties.","doc_id":7056,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5732","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Estimation of input costs for a Markov model in a German health economic evaluation of newer antidepressants","authors":"Seidl, Astrid; Danner, Marion; Wagner, Christoph J.; Sandmann, Frank G.; Sroczynski, Gaby; Stürzlinger, Heidi; Zsifkovits, Johannes; Schwalm, Anja; Lhachimi, Stefan K.; Siebert, Uwe; Gerber-Grote, Andreas","subject":" Produktion","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Estimation of input costs for a Markov model in a German health economic evaluation of newer antidepressants;  Produktion; Background: Estimating input costs for Markov models in health economic evaluations requires health state-specific costing. This is a challenge in mental illnesses such as depression, as interventions are not clearly related to health states. We present a hybrid approach to health state-specific cost estimation for a German health economic evaluation of antidepressants. Methods: Costs were determined from the perspective of the community of persons insured by statutory health insurance (“SHI insuree perspective”) and included costs for outpatient care, inpatient care, drugs, and psychotherapy. In an additional step, costs for rehabilitation and productivity losses were calculated from the societal perspective. We collected resource use data in a stepwise hierarchical approach using SHI claims data, where available, followed by data from clinical guidelines and expert surveys. Bottom-up and top-down costing approaches were combined. Results: Depending on the drug strategy and health state, the average input costs varied per patient per -week Markov cycle. The highest costs occurred for agomelatine in the health state first-line treatment (FT) (“FT relapse”) with € from the SHI insuree perspective and € from the societal perspective. From both perspectives, the lowest costs (excluding placebo) were € for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the health state “FT remission.” Conclusion: To estimate costs in health economic evaluations of treatments for depression, it can be necessary to link different data sources and costing approaches systematically to meet the requirements of the decision-analytic model. As this can increase complexity, the corresponding calculations should be presented transparently. The approach presented could provide useful input for future models.","doc_id":7109,"prior":"Produktion","posterior":"resource use","SDG12":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22090","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"EU policies : new opportunities for aquaponics","authors":"Hoevenaars, K.; Junge, Ranka; Bardocz, T.; Leskovec, M.","subject":"Aquaponics; EU policies; Agriculture; Aquaculture;  Völkerrecht und Europarecht;  Aquakultur","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"341, 639.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"EU policies : new opportunities for aquaponics; Aquaponics; EU policies; Agriculture; Aquaculture;  Völkerrecht und Europarecht;  Aquakultur; Aquaponics is a modern and sustainable food production technology.

We included type- and type- diabetes patients from a primary care setting. The DMP (intervention) comprised a structured treatment approach with an individual treatment plan, treatment goals and an interprofessional team approach. Our comprehensive outcome measures included quality of life (QOL: EQ-D-L), pre-defined indicators for diabetes guideline adherence, number of used services and direct medical costs. We applied a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to compare DMP with usual care (follow-up  year).

Extending the lifetime of MIEDs could significantly reduce their ecological footprint. Therefore, the target of the LifeSaving research project is to develop innovative business models to stimulate the lifetime extension of mobile devices.Recent LCA studies show that the production of integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for the majority of GHG emissions during the production phase. However, there is only little information available on MIED specific components such as logic or memory type integrated circuits. In order to quantify environmental impacts of lifetime extension of MIEDs new approaches for life cycle inventory modelling (e.g. modular modelling) are being developed within the LifeSaving project.However, lifetime extending measures are subject to rebound effects, which occur if the number of devices being produced does not fall as expected. Such effects depend on consumer behaviour and the rationalities of involved economic actors. Thus, environmental, behavioural and economic aspects have to be taken into account in order to develop lifetime extending business models that entail environmental benefits while being both economically viable and appealing to consumers.","doc_id":7228,"prior":"consumer behaviour","SDG12":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17823","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Arbeit, Krankheit, Invalidität : arbeits- und sozialversicherungsrechtliche Aspekte","authors":"Pärli, Kurt; Hug, Julia; Petrik, Andreas","subject":" Öffentliches Recht (CH), Arbeits-, Sozial-, Bildungs- und Kulturrecht","type":"Buch","bid":"344","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Arbeit, Krankheit, Invalidität : arbeits- und sozialversicherungsrechtliche Aspekte;  Öffentliches Recht (CH), Arbeits-, Sozial-, Bildungs- und Kulturrecht","doc_id":7257,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17167","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Detection of gray mold leaf infections prior to visual symptom appearance using a five-band multispectral sensor","authors":"Fahrentrapp, Johannes; Ria, Francesco; Geilhausen, Martin; Panassiti, Bernd","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Detection of gray mold leaf infections prior to visual symptom appearance using a five-band multispectral sensor;  Landwirtschaft; Fungal leaf diseases cause economically important damage to crop plants. Protective treatments help producers to secure good quality crops. In contrast, curative treatments based on visually detectable symptoms are often riskier and less effective because diseased crop plants may develop disease symptoms too late for curative treatments. Therefore, early disease detection prior symptom development would allow an earlier, and therefore more effective, curative management of fungal diseases. Using a five-lens multispectral imager, spectral reflectance of green, blue, red, near infrared (NIR,  nm) and rededge (RE,  nm) was recorded in time-course experiments of detached tomato leaves inoculated with the fungus Botrytis cinerea and mock infection solution. Linear regression models demonstrate NIR and RE as the two most informative spectral data sets to differentiate pathogen- and mock-inoculated leaf regions of interest (ROI). Under controlled laboratory conditions, bands collecting NIR and RE irradiance showed a lower reflectance intensity of infected tomato leaf tissue when compared with mock-inoculated leaves. Blue and red channels collected higher intensity values in pathogen- than in mock-inoculated ROIs. The reflectance intensities of the green band were not distinguishable between pathogen- and mock infected ROIs. Predictions of linear regressions indicated that gray mold leaf infections could be identified at the earliest at  hours post infection (hpi) in the most informative bands NIR and RE.

Pilzwiderstandsfähige Rebsorten bieten sich dabei als die optimale Lösung an. Diese Sorten entstehen durch Kreuzungszüchtung und vereinen die Weinqualität der Europäersorten mit den Resistenzen von amerikanischen oder asiatischen Reben.

In einem ersten Teil werden die Gründe für den geringen Piwi-Anbau aufgrund der Literatur erforscht und darauf basierend Fördermassnahmen ausformuliert.

Current developments in society and politics show that the use of pesticides is being assessed more and more critically. Fungus-resistant grape varieties are the optimal solution. These varieties are created by cross-breeding and combine the wine quality of European varieties with the resistance of American or Asian vines. In addition to the ecological advantages, these varieties also have economic advantages due to the much lower expenditure on pesticides and the saving of labour and machine resources. Despite these advantages, only .% of the total vineyard area in Switzerland is planted with piwis. The reasons lie less with the consumers than with the low acceptance of these new varieties in the industry. This paper proposes measures to promote the acceptance of piwis in the wine industry. In a first part, the reasons for the low piwi cultivation are researched on the basis of the literature and based on this, promotional measures are formulated. On the one hand, these will be quantitatively assessed by means of a live survey of over  experts at the Wädenswil Wine Days. On the other hand, a qualitative assessment is carried out through expert interviews with  wine experts from the areas of production, trade and education. The greatest challenge is seen in vinification due to the lack of experience with different wine styles. Followed by the marketing of new, unknown varieties and uncertainty in the choice of varieties. The most useful support measure is considered to be the practical exchange with expert tastings. The provision of information material and the thematisation in education are seen as further important measures. For marketing purposes, the term \"new varieties\" is preferred to \"piwi\" or other designations. Wine of very high quality is cited as the most important sales argument and further information on the improved sustainability of piwis is seen as a positive supplement. The results of the study suggest a step-by-step approach: the first step is to convince or inspire the players in the wine industry of piwi quality. Only then can the wines be successfully launched on the market. The creation of value creation networks for the interactive exchange between research and practice enables the development of best practices examples that can be made visible in the industry and pro-mote acceptance. Everyone agrees that only high-quality wines can be sold. It is therefore up to the wine industry itself to decide whether these wines will increasingly be made from new varieties in the future, thus making a proactive and responsible contribution to sustainable and innovative agriculture.","doc_id":7651,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"78","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1711","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Phylogeography and population structure of the biologically invasive phytopathogen Erwinia amylovora inferred using minisatellites","authors":"Bühlmann, Andreas; Dreo, Tanja; Rezzonico, Fabio; Pothier, Joël F.; Smits, Theo H.

We report a molecular typing system of E. amylovora based on variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis. Repeats in the E. amylovora genome were identified with comparative genomic tools, and VNTR markers were developed and validated. A Multiple-Locus VNTR Analysis (MLVA) was applied to E. amylovora isolates from bacterial collections representing global and regional distribution of the pathogen. Based on six repeats, MLVA allowed the distinction of  haplotypes among a collection of  isolates of worldwide origin. Three geographically separated groups were recognized among global isolates using Bayesian clustering methods. Analysis of regional outbreaks confirmed presence of diverse haplotypes but also high representation of certain haplotypes during outbreaks. MLVA analysis is a practical method for epidemiological studies of E. amylovora, identifying previously unresolved population structure within outbreaks. Knowledge of such structure can increase our understanding on how plant diseases emerge and spread over a given geographical region.","doc_id":7686,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23177","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Welche pflegerischen Interventionen können behaviorale und psychologische Symptome der Demenz im akut stationären Setting reduzieren?","authors":"Tobler, Joya; Warsamee, Kaltuun","subject":"Behavioral symptoms; Behavioural symptoms; Psychological symptoms; Agitation; Anxiety; Dementia; Nonpharmacological; Interventions; Acute care; Reduction of BPSD;  Pflege;  Geriatrie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610.73, 618.97","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Welche pflegerischen Interventionen können behaviorale und psychologische Symptome der Demenz im akut stationären Setting reduzieren?; Behavioral symptoms; Behavioural symptoms; Psychological symptoms; Agitation; Anxiety; Dementia; Nonpharmacological; Interventions; Acute care; Reduction of BPSD;  Pflege;  Geriatrie; Darstellung des Themas: Behaviorale und psychologische Symptome (BPSD), weisen eine hohe Inzidenz bei Demenzerkrankten auf, wobei diese mit der Fortschreitung der Krankheit an Häufigkeit und Schweregrad zunehmen.

While positive effects on soil structure have been extensively reported, the effects on specific root- and soil-associated microorganisms are less known. The aim of this study was to investigate how conservation tillage and organic farming influence the frequency and activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads. Amplicon sequencing using the S rRNA gene revealed that Pseudomonas is among the most abundant bacterial taxa in the root microbiome of field-grown wheat, independent of agronomical practices. However, pseudomonads carrying genes required for the biosynthesis of specific antimicrobial compounds were enriched in samples from conventionally farmed plots without tillage. In contrast, disease resistance tests indicated that soil from conventional no tillage plots is less resistant to the soilborne pathogen Pythium ultimum compared to soil from organic reduced tillage plots, which exhibited the highest resistance of all compared cropping systems. Reporter strain-based gene expression assays did not reveal any differences in Pseudomonas antimicrobial gene expression between soils from different cropping systems. Our results suggest that plant-beneficial pseudomonads can be favoured by certain soil cropping systems, but soil resistance against plant diseases is likely determined by a multitude of biotic factors in addition to Pseudomonas.","doc_id":7911,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19735","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Fitness status of people with axSpA : first results after implementing fitness assessments in axSpA exercise groups","authors":"Niedermann Schneider, Karin; Rausch Osthoff, Anne-Kathrin; Meichtry, André; Bräm, René; Ciurea, Adrian","subject":" Physiotherapie;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"615.82, 616.7","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Fitness status of people with axSpA : first results after implementing fitness assessments in axSpA exercise groups;  Physiotherapie;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie; Background: Public health recommendations for physical activity (PA) advise that a program of regular exercises include cardiorespiratory, muscle strength, flexibility and neuromotor exercise training at well-defined frequency, intensity and duration/repetitions, and regular evlaution over time (). The  EULAR recommendations for PA () state that this is also effective, feasible and safe for people with rheumatic diseases. Therefore, the Ankylosing Spondylitis Association of Switzerland (SVMB) has started to implement assessments for all four fitness dimensions in their exercise groups (n=).

Transition to better performing waste management systems requires not only determining what needs to be changed but also finding out how this change can be realized. Without understanding the political context, insights from decision support tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) are likely to be lost in translation to decision and policy making. This study strives to provide a first insight into the political context and address the opportunities and barriers pertinent to initiating a change in Swiss waste management. For this purpose, the discourses around a major policy process are analysed to uncover the policy beliefs and preferences of actors. Discourse coalitions are delineated by referring to the Advocacy Coalition Framework (Sabatier, ) and using the Discourse Network Analysis (Leifeld and Haunss, ) method. The results display an incoherent regime (Fuenfschilling and Truffer, ) with divergent belief clusters on core issues in waste management. Yet, some actors holding different beliefs appear to have overlapping interests on secondary issues such as the treatment of biogenic waste or plastics. Although the current political context hinders a system-wide disruptive change, transitions can be initiated at local or regional scale by utilizing the shared interest across different discourse coalitions.","doc_id":7940,"prior":"life cycle assessment","SDG12":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2072","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Development of a novel functional drink containing Aronia (Aronia melanocarpa) for the aging population","authors":"Sych, Janice Marie; Hühn, Tilo; Brombach, Christine; Good, Stephanie; Brunner, Urs","subject":" Getränketechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"663","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Development of a novel functional drink containing Aronia (Aronia melanocarpa) for the aging population;  Getränketechnologie; International Society for Horticultural Science (ISHS); Inadequate nutrient intake and reduced absorption of micro- and macronutrients among the aging population may result in reduced weight and immunity, as well as increased oxidative stress, associated with increased risk of chronic disease.

Dairy products or cereals are an important food component during adolescence. Fortification of dairy products or cereals with MN may be an effective strategy to overcome MN deficiencies, but their specific impact on health in this age group is poorly documented.Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (registration number CRD) to assess the impact of MN fortified dairy products and cereal food on the health of children and adolescents (aged – years) compared with non-fortified food. We reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCT) using electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library; latest search: January ), reference list screening and citation searches. Three pairs of reviewers assessed  studies for eligibility and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias and applied GRADE to rate quality of evidence.Results: We included  RCT (often multi MN fortification) with  pair-wise comparisons mainly from low- and middle income countries. A very small and non-significant increase of haemoglobin values emerged (. g/dl [%-CI: -. to .];  RCT with iron fortification; very low quality of evidence). No significant difference was found on anaemia risk (risk ratio .

People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been identified as significantly more disabled in ET use compared to controls, albeit less disabled than people with dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the replicability of these findings using an improved version of the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ) to compare perceptions of relevance and difficulty in ET use in participants with MCI or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls. Additional aims were to explore the validity of ETUQ, and the relationships between perceived difficulty in ET use and cognitive status, mood state, and involvement in everyday life activities.

For Switzerland, there was research available investigating the burden of physical inactivity. However, this research estimated the burden for the entire country without differentiating between sub regions although the prevalence of physical inactivity varies significantly between the French-, German- and Italian-speaking regions. Therefore, this thesis had three aims:. Estimating the health and economic burden of physical inactivity in Switzerland and for the French-, German- and Italian-speaking language regions separately. Systematically reviewing trial-based economic evaluations of interventions to reduce physical inactivity. Developing a health economic model that investigates the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions in Switzerland and its three language regionsThe thesis showed that the burden of physical inactivity in Switzerland is substantial and that the French- and Italian-speaking regions are over-proportionally affected. These two regions distinguish themselves from the German-speaking region by having a higher prevalence of physical inactivity, higher per capita health care spending, and higher disease prevalence. Due to the substantial burden of physical inactivity, interventions aiming to increase physical activity should be considered. In the systematic review we conducted, we found evidence from randomized controlled trials indicating the cost-effectiveness of some physical activity interventions for primary prevention in adults. These interventions were then further evaluated in a cost-effectiveness model built for the Swiss setting. This model showed that Swiss policy makers have cost-effective options of physical activity promotion. We recommend that individualized advice and general practitioner referral be further evaluated as interventions and that decision-making considers the specifics of the Swiss language regions. Furthermore, we judge the cost-effectiveness model to be not only relevant for Switzerland but also for other multicultural countries. Based on similar data availability, our model has the potential to be applied beyond Switzerland, primarily to high-income countries with a comparable background, as a tool to guide societal efforts in primary prevention of physical-inactivity-related diseases.","doc_id":8448,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1740","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Erwinia amylovora in the genomics era : from genomes to pathogen virulence, regulation, and disease control strategies","authors":"Smits, Theo; Duffy, Brion; Sundin, George; Zhao, Youfu; Rezzonico, Fabio","subject":"Intraspecies diversity; Niche adaptation; Type III secretion system; Diagnostic;  Biologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Erwinia amylovora in the genomics era : from genomes to pathogen virulence, regulation, and disease control strategies; Intraspecies diversity; Niche adaptation; Type III secretion system; Diagnostic;  Biologie; The publication of the first Erwinia amylovora genome has greatly accelerated and advanced our understanding of the fire blight organism.

Brain areas with relatively higher neuronal activity, metabolic demand, and production of reactive oxygen species in earlier life may have higher beta amyloid deposition in later life. The aim of this study was to investigate early life patterns of perfusion and late life patterns of amyloid deposition to determine the extent to which normative cerebral perfusion predisposes specific regions to future beta amyloid deposition.Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty-eight healthy, older human subjects (age: – years old; % women) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [  C]PiB for measures of amyloid burden. Cerebral perfusion maps derived from  healthy younger adults (age: –; %) who had undergone single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, were averaged to create a normative template, repre- sentative of young, healthy adults.

Effective characterization of potential antifibrotic drugs has been constrained by poor formation of the extracellular matrix in vitro, due to tardy procollagen processing by collagen C‐proteinase/BMP‐, and difficulties in relating this matrix to cell numbers in experimental samples.Experimental approach: The Scar‐in‐a‐Jar model provided, in vitro, the complete biosynthetic cascade of collagen matrix formation including complete conversion of procollagen by C‐proteinase/BMP‐, its subsequent extracellular deposition and lysyl oxidase‐mediated cross‐linking, achieved by applying the biophysical principle of macromolecular ‘crowding’. Collagen matrix deposition, velocity and morphology can be controlled using negatively charged ‘crowders’ in a rapid ( days) mode or a mixture of neutral ‘crowders’ in an accelerated ( days) mode. Combined with quantitative optical bioimaging, this novel system allows for in situ assessment of the area of deposited collagen(s) per cell.Key results: Optical evaluation of known and novel antifibrotic compounds effective at the epigenetic, post‐transcriptional/translational/secretional level correlated excellently with corresponding biochemical analyses. Focusing on quantitation of deposited collagen, the Scar‐in‐a‐Jar was most effective in assessing novel inhibitors that may have multiple targets, such as microRNAc, found to be a promising antifibrotic agent.Conclusions and implications: This novel screening system supersedes current in vitro fibroplasia models, as a fast, quantitative and non‐destructive technique.

Da Snus  in der Schweiz legalisiert wurde, ist es bedeutsam, die gesundheitlichen Risiken von Snus zu kennen und einen Vergleich zwischen den beiden Tabakprodukten anzustellen. Ziel: Das Ziel dieser Bachelorarbeit ist es, den aktuellen Wissensstand zu den gesundheitlichen Risiken von Snus zu erfassen und diese Risiken mit denjenigen des Zigarettenkonsums zu vergleichen. Methode: Am . Dezember  wurde eine Literaturrecherche in den Datenbanken PubMed, Cinahl Complete und Google Scholar durchgeführt. Ergebnisse: Es wurden  Artikel eingeschlossen, welche verschiedenste Erkrankungen wie Krebs, Autoimmunerkrankungen oder auch Handekzeme im Zusammenhang mit den beiden Tabakprodukten erforschten.

This review paper provides a characterization of urban solid and liquid resource flows (including water, nutrients, metals, potential energy, and organics), which pass through selected nature-based solutions (NBS) and supporting units (SU), expanding on that characterization through the study of existing cases. In particular, this paper presents the currently implemented NBS units for resource recovery, the applicable solid and liquid urban waste streams and the SU dedicated to increasing the quality and minimizing hazards of specific streams at the source level (e.g., concentrated fertilizers, disinfected recovered products). The recovery efficiency of systems, where NBS and SU are combined, operated at a micro- or meso-scale and applied at technology readiness levels higher than , is reviewed.

Für wirksame und nachhaltige Entstigmstisierungsarbeit ist der Einbezug von Betroffenen zentral. Infolgedessen erhebt die vorliegende Bachelorarbeiten subjektive Bedeutungs- und Wahrnehmungsfaktoren von Betroffenen zum Thema Stigmatisierung von psychisch erkrankten Menschen. Die Arbeit identifiziert ausserdem, welches Verhalten und welchen Umgang sich Betroffene von ihrem Umfeld wünschen, um sich akzeptiert, unterstützt und als ganzheitlicher Teil der Gesellschaft zu fühlen. Betroffenen soll dadurch eine Stimme gegeben werden. Methode: Für die Datenerhebung werden teilstrukturierte qualitative Interviews mit vier Menschen durchgeführt, die Erfahrungen mit psychischen Schwierigkeiten haben. Die Auswertung erfolgt durch die inhaltlich strukturierte qualitative Inhaltsanalyse nach Mayring. Ergebnisse: Betroffene definieren und nehmen Stigmatisierung unterschiedlich wahr. Stigmatisierung wird als nicht fassbares Phänomen, dass in der Gesellschaft ganz klar besteht und Negativfolgen mit sich bringt, beschrieben. Betroffene wünschen sich mehr Transparenz und Akzeptanz bei psychischen Schwierigkeiten. Die offene Kommunikation über psychische Schwierigkeiten ist ein wichtiger Schlüsselpunkt.

Identifying presymptomatic structural brain changes associated with Aβ deposition might lead to a better understanding of its consequences and provide early diagnostic information. In this respect we analyzed measures of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes along with hippocampal, thalamic and striatal shape and surface area by applying novel analysis strategies for structural magnetic resonance imaging. We included  cognitively normal elderly subjects after careful clinical and neuropsychological workup. Standardized uptake value ratios (cerebellar reference) for uptake of -C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) were calculated from positron emission tomographic data for a cortical measurement and for bilateral hippocampus, thalamus and striatum. Associations to shape, surface area, volume and cortical thickness were tested using regression models that included significant predictors as covariates. Left anterior hippocampal shape was associated with regional PiB uptake (P < ., FDR corrected), whereas volumes of the hippocampi and their subregions were not associated with cortical or regional PiB uptake (all P > ., FDR corrected). Within the entorhinal cortical region of both hemispheres, thickness was negatively associated with cortical PiB uptake (P < ., FDR corrected).

The aim of a circular economy is to transform these unused wastes into usable resources. This transformation from a linear to a circular system is challenging due the limited knowledge on possibilities for the reuse of such waste products. In addition, the actual reuse is hindered by several constraints such as lacking information on the specific composition of the unused waste, on the availability of the unused waste in time and space as well as on the quantity of unused waste. The goal of the SHAREBOX Horizon  project is the use information and communications technology for the development of a platform for the facilitation of circular approaches for material and waste flows within the European processing industries.The SHAREBOX platform is a database of available waste and resources required by companies. The matching of supply and demand by the platform enables the transformation of waste to resources. The platform also serves as the first point of contact between different partners in a circular system. Furthermore, the platform enables the identification of new synergies between the different subsectors of the industries as well as optimal matching from the perspective of a circular economy. We analysed the life cycle based impacts and benefits the transformation of different waste types to usable resources including relevant life cycle steps as beneficiation and transportation. The analysis for greenhouse gases, primary energy demand and mineral resource use revealed that the environmental benefit of transformation from waste to resources strongly depends on the reused material type as well as crucial properties like density of the material and geographic proximity of the partners of the synergy. However, the relative benefits were higher for the mineral resource compared to greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy demand, mainly due to the energy requirement in the steps beneficiation and transportation.Transformation from linear systems to circular systems can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions; primary energy demand as well as mineral resource use of the whole value chain and contribute to a greener economy. However, the reuse of resources also cause additional impacts in the life cycle stage of beneficiation as well as transportation, especially for primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the completeness of the scope is crucial for the assessment and generalisations overarching different types of waste remain challenging.","doc_id":8964,"prior":"circular economy","SDG12":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3890","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Food Sharing : engagiert gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung","authors":"Baur, Nicole Anja","subject":"Sharing; Economy; Community; Lebensmittel; Armut;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"300, 361, 640","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Food Sharing : engagiert gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung; Sharing; Economy; Community; Lebensmittel; Armut;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben; In immer mehr Städten engagieren sich Lebensmittelretterinnen und -retter gegen Foodwaste, also das Wegwerfen noch einwandfreier Lebensmittel, die nicht mehr verkauft werden können.

Several multinational companies have already joined networks to accelerate the transition into futureproofed business practices. Startups, long-established companies and scientific research are devising groundbreaking solutions to work towards this new business imperative. At its core, the Circular Economy aims at replacing the traditional, linear way of extraction, production, consumption and disposal with a circular model, where waste is considered as a precious resource for new applications.However, it seems that in the Swiss business environment the concept is rather unknown or ignored, even though it is highly relevant considering the current and forecasted macro-economic and environmental developments. “Adapt or die” is one of the more recent statements in the light of environmental pollution, the tightening of resource availability together with population growth and increasing consumption on a global level. Therefore, this Bachelor’s thesis aims to analyze the present status of and to provide guidance for the Swiss fashion retail industry.By means of a multiple-case, embedded case study design, two Swiss fashion retailers are studied within their respective ecosystems. The two units of study were selected to approach a certain degree of external analytic validity, which is the reason why a large multinational and a smaller player with Swiss tradition were chosen. Qualitative and quantitative sources of primary and secondary data are adduced, whereas solely qualitative methods are applied. The assessments are then made inductively on the basis of the business model Recovery & Recycling. It is as such one of five Accenture-devised possibilities for enterprises to embark on a circular future.It was found that successfully employing the Recovery & Recycling business model embraces decoupling in two different ways: decoupling from potentially harmful resources, the environmental perspective and, decoupling from increasingly scarce resources, the economic perspective. The Swiss fashion industry turned out to be rather advanced within the environmental perspective, yet there is room for improvement when it comes to closing the material loop from an economic perspective. Smaller players with limited means are well advised to draw on the many instruments or methods already available and to imitate larger, more advanced players. Finally, some advancements depend on breakthroughs in recycling technology and material sciences. Nevertheless, much can already be improved by efficient design of products and processes in a way that facilitates reuse and recycling.","doc_id":9249,"prior":"environmental pollution","SDG12":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17131","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Gesundheit der älteren Bevölkerung in der Schweiz : eine Studie basierend auf Daten der Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) im Auftrag des Bundesamts für Gesundheit","authors":"Höglinger, Marc; Francisca, Ehrler; Maurer, Jürgen","subject":"Ageing Konzept; Ältere Bevölkerung Schweiz; Gesundheit Schweiz; Krankheit im Alter; Lebensqualität; SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe);  Soziale Gruppen;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"305, 610","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Gesundheit der älteren Bevölkerung in der Schweiz : eine Studie basierend auf Daten der Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) im Auftrag des Bundesamts für Gesundheit; Ageing Konzept; Ältere Bevölkerung Schweiz; Gesundheit Schweiz; Krankheit im Alter; Lebensqualität; SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe);  Soziale Gruppen;  Medizin und Gesundheit","doc_id":9315,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18474","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Leben mit chronischen Krankheiten im Alter : differentielle Effekte auf Lebensqualität und Alltagsautonomie nach sozialen Gruppen","authors":"Höglinger, Marc; Seiler, Simon","subject":" Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Leben mit chronischen Krankheiten im Alter : differentielle Effekte auf Lebensqualität und Alltagsautonomie nach sozialen Gruppen;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Rund zwei Drittel der Bevölkerung der Schweiz ab  Jahren leiden an mindestens einer chronischen Krankheit wie Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, COPD, Diabetes, Krebs oder Depression. Diese Erkrankungen sind für etwa die Hälfte aller vorzeitigen Todesfälle verantwortlich und stellen eine erhebliche Belastung für Patienten, Angehörige und das Gesundheitssystem dar. Diverse Studien zeigen, dass soziale Faktoren wie der sozioökonomische Hintergrund, die Bildung oder die soziale Integration, das Risiko, eine chronische Erkrankung zu entwickeln, erheblich beeinflussen.Soziale Faktoren beeinflussen jedoch nicht nur das Risiko, eine chronische Erkrankung zu entwickeln, sondern auch, wie Patienten mit ihrem Leiden umgehen und wie viel formelle und informelle Unterstützung sie erhalten. Zudem beeinflussen sie die Zugangschancen zu einer adäquaten Gesundheitsversorgung. Folglich dürften sich diesbezüglich Unterschiede in den Auswirkungen einer chronischen Erkrankung auf die Lebensqualität und Alltagsautonomie zeigen.Beispielsweise dürften Diabetes-Patientinnen mit sozioökonomisch hohem Status ihre Krankheit tendenziell besser bewältigen als solche mit niedrigem Einkommen und tiefem Bildungsniveau. Oder Herzinfarkt-Patienten dürften sich schneller erholen und eine bessere Lebensqualität wiedererlangen, wenn sie über ein gutes soziales Netzwerk verfügen als wenn sie schlecht sozial integriert sind. In unserem Beitrag verwenden wir Daten des Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), um den Verlauf der Lebensqualität und der Alltagsautonomie von Patientinnen und Patienten mit chronischen Erkrankungen in der Schweiz zu analysieren.

Stressfolgeerkrankungen, wie Depressionen, zählen zu den häufigsten Krankheiten weltweit, inklusive der Schweiz. Aus diesem Grund sind innovative Lösungen gefragt, die zur Behandlung von Menschen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen beitragen. In unterschiedlichen Studien konnte eine positive Auswirkung der Natur auf die Gesundheit festgestellt werden. Therapiegärten tragen zum Behandlungserfolg bei, indem sie den positiven Effekt der Natur auf den menschlichen Körper mit einem Raum für Therapien und Aktivitäten in einem geschützten Rahmen verbinden. In dieser Arbeit wurden die planerischen Anforderungen an Therapiegärten für Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen erarbeitet und beschrieben, wie das Medium Garten den Heilungsprozess unterstützen kann. Dazu wurde mittels einer Internetrecherche untersucht, ob in der Schweiz sowie in Liechtenstein bereits Therapiegärten für Personen mit einer psychischen Störung existieren. Dabei konnte ein Therapiegarten der Psychiatrische Dienste Aargau AG (PDAG) sowie ein «Alpengarten», der auf Depression spezialisierten Privatklinik Clinicum Alpinum, eruiert werden. Beide Gärten wurden untersucht und analysiert, wie diese in die Behandlung der Klientel miteinbezogen werden. Es konnte herausgefunden werden, dass der Therapiegarten der PDAG als Teil der Arbeitstherapie der Klinik gestaltet wurde und die Clinicum Alpinum vermehrt die Umgebung, als den Garten, als Therapieort nutzte. Mittels zweier Fachpersoneninterviews, mit dem Gartentherapeuten und der Gartentherapeutin der PDAG sowie einer Psychologin der Luzerner Psychiatrie, wurde mit ersteren die Durchführung der Gartentherapie an der PDAG eruiert und mit letzterer die therapeutischen Ziele bei Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen besprochen und analysiert, wie ein Therapiegarten die Behandlung unterstützen kann. Aufgrund einer Literaturrecherche sowie den Interviews wurden Räume und Orte definiert, die für Personen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen während der Rehabilitation besonders unterstützend sind und welche Pflanzen und Elemente in einem Therapiegarten eingesetzt werden sollten. Dabei wurde festgestellt, dass abgelegene und sichere Räume mit dem Fokus auf die wilde Natur sowie einer grossen floristischen und faunistischen Artenvielfalt von Personen mit einer Stressfolgeerkrankung besonders präferiert werden. Weiter sollten simple, stabile und schöne Objekte in einem Therapiegarten vorhanden sein, da Beziehungen von Menschen zu leblosen Objekten in der Natur, wie Steine oder Wasser, am einfachsten aufzubauen sowie zu halten sind und dadurch den Stress lindern können. Bezüglich der Pflanzenwahl eignen sich, hinsichtlich des ökologischen und therapeutischen Aspekts, einheimische Pflanzen, welche die Klientel im Therapiegarten über die fünf Hauptsinne wahrnehmen können. Dabei sind Pflanzen zur visuellen und olfaktorischen Wahrnehmung sowie zur zeitlichen Orientierung in der Gartentherapie besonders unterstützend.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stress is one of the main causes of mental illness. Stress related diseases, such as depression, are among the most common diseases worldwide, including Switzerland. For this reason, innovative solutions are needed to help treating people with stress-related diseases. Various studies have shown a positive effect of nature on health. Therapeutic gardens contribute to the success of treatment by combining the positive effect of nature on the human body with a space for therapy in a protected setting. In this work the planning requirements for therapeutic gardens for people with stress-related ill-nesses were developed. Furthermore, this work describes how the medium garden can support the healing process. An internet search was carried out to determine if therapeutic gardens for people with a mental disorder already exist in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein. In the Psychiatrische Dienste Aargau AG (PDAG) as well as the private clinic Clinicum Alpinum, which specializes in depression, therapeutic gardens exist already. Both gardens were examined to analyze how they are included in the treatment of patients. It was found that the therapy garden of the PDAG was designed as part of the clinic's occupational therapy. The Clinicum Alpinum, however, mainly uses its surroundings as a place of therapy and focuses more on the positive effects of nature itself. In order to evaluate how garden therapy is implemented at PDAG two of its garden therapists have been interviewed. To discuss the therapeutic goals for people with stress-related diseases and to analyze how a therapy garden can support the treatment an additional expert interview with a psychologist from the Lucerne Psychiatric Clinic has been conducted. Based on a literature research and the interviews, rooms and places which are particularly supportive for persons with stress-related diseases during rehabilitation have been defined. Additionally, it has been determined which plants and elements should be used in a therapeutic garden. It was found that remote and safe rooms with a focus on wild nature and a large floristic and faunistic biodiversity are particularly preferred by persons with a stress-related disease. Furthermore, simple, stable and beautiful objects should be available in a therapy garden. Relationships between people and inanimate objects in nature, such as stones or water, are the easiest to build and maintain and can therefore relieve stress. Plants, which clients can perceive in the therapeutic garden through the five main senses, are most suitable. Particularly supportive in garden therapy are plants for visual and olfactory perception as well as for temporal orientation.","doc_id":9417,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18664","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Gesundheitsbezogene Register : eine Perspektive für Praxis und Forschung der Ergotherapie?","authors":"Gantschnig, Brigitte; Friedli, Tom","subject":"Ergotherapie; Gesundheitsbezogene Register; Patienten; Klienten;  Ergotherapie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"615.8515","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Gesundheitsbezogene Register : eine Perspektive für Praxis und Forschung der Ergotherapie?; Ergotherapie; Gesundheitsbezogene Register; Patienten; Klienten;  Ergotherapie; Hintergrund: Gesundheitsbezogene Register, die auf systematisch gesammelten Daten basieren, übernehmen wichtige Funktionen in der Überprüfung von Versorgungsqualität, Wirksamkeit und Kostenwirksamkeit von medizinisch-therapeutischen Leistungen.

But the lack of diagnostic coding in outpatient care often precludes a decomposition by disease. Yet, health insurance claims data hold a variety of diagnostic clues that may be used to identify diseases.Methods: In this study, we decompose total outpatient care spending in Switzerland by age, sex, service type, and  exhaustive and mutually exclusive diseases according to the Global Burden of Disease classification. Using data of a large health insurance provider, we identify diseases based on diagnostic clues. These clues include type of medication, inpatient treatment, physician specialization, and disease specific outpatient treatments and examinations. We determine disease-specific spending by direct (clues-based) and indirect (regression-based) spending assignment.Results: Our results suggest a high precision of disease identification for many diseases. Overall, % of outpatient spending can be assigned to diseases, mostly based on indirect assignment using regression.

Many luxury watch brands and retailers have started to realize that this market is lucrative and profitable. However, not much is known about what is driving the recent boom and what the consumer motivations are that lead to a widespread interest in preowned and vintage luxury watches. While the field of second-hand luxury consumption in general is rather well explored, scientific literature on the purchase motivations behind specific product categories, in this case pre-owned luxury watches, is scarce. The present study was led by the following research questions: What motivates consumers to acquire pre-owned luxury watches? What are the main drivers of the growing popularity of preowned luxury watches? The study is based on a thorough analysis of existing literature and primary qualitative research, including expert interviews and a computer-mediated qualitative survey to include the consumer perspective. The motivations identified in this study, namely lower price and investment (economic factors), quality and durability (sustainability factors), the need for social acceptance, social understatement, and standing out from the crowd (social factors), availability, design, and brand (product-related factors), as well as treasure hunting and collecting (recreational factors) add to and partly confirm insights in an existing body of literature on pre-owned consumer behavior which, however, is largely focused on fashion. Additionally, five drivers of the growth of the preowned luxury watch market were identified, namely the availability of luxury watches in general, financial opportunities, online channels and e-commerce, and the presence of established companies in this emerging field.

Three TSS gene clusters were identified in the genome of E. amylovora CFBP , of which TSS- and TSS- represent complete TSS machineries, while TSS- is reduced in its gene content. Results: To assess the contribution of TSSs to virulence and potential transcriptomic changes of E. amylovora CFBP , single and double mutants in two structural genes were generated for TSS- and TSS-. Plant assays showed that mutants in TSS- were slightly more virulent in apple shoots while inducing less disease symptoms on apple flowers, indicating that TSSs have only a minor effect on virulence of E. amylovora CFBP . The mutations led under in vitro conditions to the differential expression of type III secretion systems, iron acquisition, chemotaxis, flagellar, and fimbrial genes. Comparison of the in planta and in vitro transcriptome data sets revealed a common differential expression of three processes and a set of chemotaxis and motility genes. Additional experiments proved that TSS mutants are impaired in their motility. Conclusion: These results suggest that the deletion of TSSs alters metabolic and motility processes. Nevertheless, the difference in lesion development in apple shoots and flower necrosis of TSS mutants was indicative that TSSs influences the disease progression and the establishment of the pathogen on host plants.","doc_id":9778,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8259","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Functional assignment to positively selected sites in the core type III effector RipG7 from Ralstonia solanacearum","authors":"Wang, Keke; Remigi, Philippe; Anisimova, Maria; Lonjon, Fabien; Kars, Ilona; Kajava, Andrey; Li, Chien-Hui; Cheng, Chiu-Ping; Vailleau, Fabienne; Genin, Stéphane; Peeters, Nemo","subject":"LRR; Medicago truncatula; Ralstonia solanacearum; positive selection; Type III effector; Virulence function; Amino acid sequence; Bacterial protein; Genetic complementation test; Medicago truncatula; Molecular model; Site-directed mutagenesis; Mutation; Phylogeny; Plant disease; Ralstonia solanacearum; Amino acid sequence homology; Virulence; Bacterial secretion system; Genetic selection;  Biologie;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570, 580","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Functional assignment to positively selected sites in the core type III effector RipG from Ralstonia solanacearum; LRR; Medicago truncatula; Ralstonia solanacearum; positive selection; Type III effector; Virulence function; Amino acid sequence; Bacterial protein; Genetic complementation test; Medicago truncatula; Molecular model; Site-directed mutagenesis; Mutation; Phylogeny; Plant disease; Ralstonia solanacearum; Amino acid sequence homology; Virulence; Bacterial secretion system; Genetic selection;  Biologie;  Pflanzen (Botanik); The soil-borne pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum causes bacterial wilt in a broad range of plants. The main virulence determinants of R. solanacearum are the type III secretion system (TSS) and its associated type III effectors (TEs), translocated into the host cells. Of the conserved TEs among R. solanacearum strains, the Fbox protein RipG is required for R. solanacearum pathogenesis on Medicago truncatula. In this work, we describe the natural ripG variability existing in the R. solanacearum species complex. We show that eight representative ripG orthologues have different contributions to pathogenicity on M. truncatula: only ripG from Asian or African strains can complement the absence of ripG in GMI (Asian reference strain). Nonetheless, RipG proteins from American and Indonesian strains can still interact with M. truncatula SKP-like/MSKa protein, essential for the function of RipG in virulence. This indicates that the absence of complementation is most likely a result of the variability in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of RipG. We identified  sites under positive selection in the LRR domains of RipG. By studying the functional impact of these  sites, we show the contribution of five positively selected sites for the function of RipGCMR in M. truncatula colonization. This work reveals the genetic and functional variation of the essential core TE RipG from R. solanacearum. This analysis is the first of its kind on an essential disease-controlling TE, and sheds light on the co-evolutionary arms race between the bacterium and its hosts.","doc_id":9821,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17699","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Maternal health development programs : comparing priorities of bilateral and private donors","authors":"Deleye, Cécile; Lang, Achim","subject":" Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Maternal health development programs : comparing priorities of bilateral and private donors;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: The face of international aid for health and development is changing.

Foundations can be characterized as focusing on family planning services and research, while disregarding specific diseases, capacity-building and ICT. Foundations cooperate less than other donors; but when they do, they cooperate in particular with non-state actors, local as well as non-local.Conclusions: These findings should help developing coordination mechanisms that embrace the differences and similarities of the different types of donors. As donor groups specialize in different contexts, NGOs and governments working on development and health aid may target donors groups that have specialized in certain issues.","doc_id":9830,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13263","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Comparison of Dutch and Russian standards for calculating physical effects of hazardous substances","authors":"Leksin, Alexey; Barth, Uli; Adelulov, D.; Mock, Ralf Günter","subject":"Standards; Brandschutz; Risiko;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"363","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Comparison of Dutch and Russian standards for calculating physical effects of hazardous substances; Standards; Brandschutz; Risiko;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Methods to calculate effects of the accidental release of hazardous chemicals are documented in various national technical standards, guidelines and other bodies of laws.

Higher levels of trust in personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies have been previously related to lower levels of emotional exhaustion, yet little is known on how to achieve such a perception of safety. We thus sought to identify institutional actions, strategies and policies related to HCWs’ safety perception during the early phase of the pandemic at a tertiary care center in Switzerland by interviewing HCWs from different clinics, professions, and positions.Methods: For this qualitative study,  face-to-face semi-structured interviews were performed. Interviews were based on a guide that addressed the perception of institutional strategies and policies during the first phase of the pandemic in March . The participants included doctors (n = ) and nurses (n = ) in senior and non-senior positions from eight clinics in the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, all involved in patient care. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and organized using MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH, Berlin).Findings: Five recurring themes were identified to affect HCWs’ perception of their safety during the SARS-CoV- pandemic: () transparency and clarity of information, () communication on the availability of PPE (with the provision of information alone increasing the feeling of safety even if supplies of PPE were reported as low), () uniformity and consistency of guidelines, () digital resources to support face-to-face teaching (although personal information transfer is still being considered superior in terms of strengthening safety perception) and () support and appreciation for the work performed.Conclusions: This study identifies institutional policies and actions influencing HCWs’ safety perception during the first wave of the COVID- pandemic, the most important of which is the factor of transparent communication. This knowledge reveals potential areas of action critical to improving preparedness and management in hospitals faced with an infectious disease threat.","doc_id":10167,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12078","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Clinical data sharing : a data scientist's perspective","authors":"Juchler, Norman; Schilling, Sabine; Watanabe, Kazuhiro; Anzai, Hitomi; Rüfenacht, Daniel; Bijlenga, Philippe; Kurtcuoglu, Vartan; Hirsch, Sven","subject":"Intracranial aneurysms; Clinical data sharing;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"005, 610","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Clinical data sharing : a data scientist's perspective; Intracranial aneurysms; Clinical data sharing;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Medizin und Gesundheit; An ever increasing amount of medical data is collected and used for scientific and clinical purposes.

A major challenge for wireless electronic implants is that they typically require microchips, which adds complexity and may compromise long‐term stability. Here, a chipless wireless strain sensor technology based on a novel soft conductor with high cyclic stability is reported. The composite material consists of gold‐coated titanium dioxide nanowires embedded in a soft silicone elastomer. The implantable strain sensor is based on an resonant circuit which consists of a stretchable plate capacitor and a coil for inductive readout of its resonance frequency. Successful continuous wireless readout during % strain cycles is demonstrated. The sensor element has a Young's modulus of  kPa, similar to that of the bladder in order to not impair physiological bladder expansion.

A joint research project of the University of Cape Town and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences was aimed to quantify the mitigation of environmental impacts through photovoltaic electricity for irrigation in the South African maize production by mean of life cycle assessment (LCA). The study focused on maize, since it is the most important staple food for South African's people.Based on a life cycle assessment covering the whole value chain of maize production in South Africa, electricity consumption for irrigation figured out to be one of the hotspots according to environmental impacts in the maize production. Consequently, the substitution of South African electricity mix for irrigation with electricity from photovoltaic was defined as an effective clean technology to mitigate the environmental impacts of the South African maize production.By switching to photovoltaic electricity supply, the global warming potential of maize production under irrigation can be reduced by %.

The aim of our research is to assess the prevalence and treatment costs of asthma and COPD in Switzerland based on a variety of data sources. Methods: Our analysis was mainly based on claims data provided by Helsana, a large health insurer, and on the Swiss Health Survey (SHS), a large and representative population survey. Individuals with asthma and COPD were identified based on the type of drugs purchased. Information on inpatient diagnosis, medical procedures and laboratory examinations were also used to improve the identification.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular method used to assess the sustainability of future waste management options. The uncertainties about future energy systems and waste compositions, however, may lead to ambiguous LCA results. One way to deal with this challenge is the development of joint energy and waste scenarios to investigate the robustness of waste management options. To date, joint energy and waste scenarios rely on the integration of large economic and engineering models. Complex models can hamper the transparency required for decision-makers to understand and implement LCA recommendations. Here we present the alternative of combining diverse energy scenarios and stakeholder-based waste storylines. This is a more qualitative approach than previous sustainable energy/waste evaluations and has a double aim: to address upfront the energy and waste composition sensitivity and enhance transparency by both relying on well-documented energy scenarios and involving stakeholders in the waste storyline formulation. We apply the approach to the Swiss municipal solid waste (MSW) management system in the context of the energy transition away from nuclear power. Three energy scenarios capture how radical the transition might be, while the storylines reflect societal developments and waste policies leading to low, high, and average MSW amounts. The approach delivers feasibility spaces of energy systems and waste compositions as input to the LCAs. It ensures a high level of transparency, which, in conjunction with the participation of decision-makers, has the potential to increase the chances of implementation of the recommendations based on LCA results.","doc_id":10516,"prior":"solid waste","SDG12":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24016","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Xanthomonas hortorum – beyond gardens : current taxonomy, genomics, and virulence repertoires","authors":"Dia, Nay C.; Morinière, Lucas; Cottyn, Bart; Bernal, Eduardo; Jacobs, Jonathan M.; Koebnik, Ralf; Osdaghi, Ebrahim; Potnis, Neha; Pothier, Joël F.","subject":"Bacterial blight; Carrot; Dandelion; Leaf spot; Lettuce; Pelargonium; Tomato; Xanthomonas hortorum;  Biochemie;  Mikrobiologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 579","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Xanthomonas hortorum – beyond gardens : current taxonomy, genomics, and virulence repertoires; Bacterial blight; Carrot; Dandelion; Leaf spot; Lettuce; Pelargonium; Tomato; Xanthomonas hortorum;  Biochemie;  Mikrobiologie; Taxonomy: Bacteria; Phylum Proteobacteria; Class Gammaproteobacteria; Order Lysobacterales (earlier synonym of Xanthomonadales); Family Lysobacteraceae (earlier synonym of Xanthomonadaceae); Genus Xanthomonas; Species X. hortorum; Pathovars: pv. carotae, pv. vitians, pv. hederae, pv. pelargonii, pv. taraxaci, pv. cynarae, and pv. gardneri.Host range: Xanthomonas hortorum affects agricultural crops, and horticultural and wild plants. Tomato, carrot, artichoke, lettuce, pelargonium, ivy, and dandelion were originally described as the main natural hosts of the seven separate pathovars. Artificial inoculation experiments also revealed other hosts. The natural and experimental host ranges are expected to be broader than initially assumed. Additionally, several strains, yet to be assigned to a pathovar within X. hortorum, cause diseases on several other plant species such as peony, sweet wormwood, lavender, and oak-leaf hydrangea.Epidemiology and control: X. hortorum pathovars are mainly disseminated by infected seeds (e.g., X. hortorum pvs carotae and vitians) or cuttings (e.g., X. hortorum pv. pelargonii) and can be further dispersed by wind and rain, or mechanically transferred during planting and cultivation. Global trade of plants, seeds, and other propagating material constitutes a major pathway for their introduction and spread into new geographical areas. The propagules of some pathovars (e.g., X. horturum pv. pelargonii) are spread by insect vectors, while those of others can survive in crop residues and soils, and overwinter until the following growing season (e.g., X. hortorum pvs vitians and carotae). Control measures against X. hortorum pathovars are varied and include exclusion strategies (i.e., by using certification programmes and quarantine regulations) to multiple agricultural practices such as the application of phytosanitary products. Copper-based compounds against X. hortorum are used, but the emergence of copper-tolerant strains represents a major threat for their effective management. With the current lack of efficient chemical or biological disease management strategies, host resistance appears promising, but is not without challenges. The intrastrain genetic variability within the same pathovar poses a challenge for breeding cultivars with durable resistance.Useful websites: https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/XANTGA, https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/XANTCR, https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/XANTPE, https://www.euroxanth.eu, http://www.xanthomonas.org, http://www.xanthomonas.org/dokuwiki","doc_id":10521,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"5","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8864","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A communication technique for swarm-capable autonomous agents","authors":"Doran, Hans Dermot","subject":"Robotics; RFID; Pheromones; Industrial communication;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"621.3","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"A communication technique for swarm-capable autonomous agents; Robotics; RFID; Pheromones; Industrial communication;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; This paper reports on a communication technique and associated technology designed to achieve embodied and situated communication between swarm-capable autonomous agents.

Bis ein Moment der Unachtsamkeit oder eine Krankheit alles verändert. Die Querschnittlähmung, sei es unfall- oder krankheitsbedingter Ursache, zwingt den Menschen in die Lage, auf Rollstuhl und Unterstützung anderer angewiesen zu sein. Dies beeinflusst die Lebensqualität der Betroffenen, steigert das Risiko für Komorbiditäten und verursacht wirtschaftliche Kosten. Neue Technologien, wie Exoskelett-Trainingsgeräte, ermöglichen inkomplett Querschnittgelähmten das aufrechte Gehen und somit auch ein Gehtraining. In dieser Arbeit werden mögliche Effekte des Trainings mit den Exoskeletten Lokomat und EksoNR auf die Gehfähigkeit bei inkomplett Querschnittgelähmten verglichen. Zu diesem Zweck wurde ein Messprotokoll für eine Case-Control-Studie erstellt, um einen Vergleich unter gezielt definierten Bedingungen zu planen. Auf Basis der Studienresultate soll eine Aussage zur klinischen Relevanz generiert werden. Es wird der allgemeine Hintergrund der Paraplegie mit möglichen Behandlungsansätzen beschrieben, womit die Aspekte des Messprotokolls begründet werden.

Until a moment of inattention or illness changes everything. Paraplegia, whether caused by an accident or illness, forces people to rely on wheelchairs and the support of others. This affects their quality of life, increases the risk of comorbidities and causes economic costs. New technologies, such as exoskeleton training devices, enable incomplete paraplegic people to walk upright and perform gait trainings.This work compares possible effects of training with the exoskeletons Lokomat and EksoNR on the ability to walk in incompletely paralyzed people. For this purpose, a study protocol for a case control study was created in order to plan a comparison under specifically defined conditions. The study outcomes generate a statement on the clinical relevance. The general background of paraplegia with possible treatment approaches is described, with which the aspects of the study protocol are justified. Various studies show that exoskeleton therapy can positively influence the ability to walk. However, for clear evidence further studies are required to investigate this issue.","doc_id":10639,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19626","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Sichtbar grün : eine Analyse grüner Kundensegmente und ihrer Konsummotive","authors":"Kübler, Marisa","subject":" Marketingmanagement","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"658.8","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Sichtbar grün : eine Analyse grüner Kundensegmente und ihrer Konsummotive;  Marketingmanagement; Der Umweltschutz ist omnipräsent. Weil sich immer grössere Teile der europäischen Bevölkerung der unumkehrbaren Folgen der Klimaerwärmung bewusst werden, wird zunehmend grüner konsumiert. Die Forschung geht bisher davon aus, dass vor allem ökologische oder altruistische Motive Hauptgrund für diese Art von Konsum sind. Die vorliegende Studie hingegen widmet sich zusätzlich zu bisher erforschten Motiven weiteren, teils unbewussten Motiven, die den Umweltschutz zwar nicht direkt bezwecken, gleichwohl aber zu grünem Konsumverhalten führen. In der Forschung wird weitestgehend davon ausgegangen, dass sich die beiden Konsumentengruppen «Materialisten» und «Grüne Konsumenten» grundlegend unterscheiden. Gleichzeitig werden sie in bisherigen Studien nur isoliert betrachtet. Erst wenige Pionierstudien liefern wegweisende Erkenntnisse darüber, dass sich die beiden Gruppen aber nicht dichotom verhalten müssen, sondern in gewissen Teilaspekten bedeutsame Überschneidungen aufweisen können.  Die vorliegende Studie untersucht sowohl grüne und materialistische Konsumentenprofile als auch sogenannte Voluntary Simplifier (VS).  VS praktizieren grünen Konsum nicht nur durch den Kauf möglichst grüner Produkte, sondern durch die erhebliche Reduktion des eigenen Konsums. Alle untersuchten Konsumentengruppen werden in Bezug auf ihr grünes Verhalten entlang des gesamten Konsumzyklus befragt, um so eine möglichst fundierte Wissensbasis des Konsumentenverhaltens und damit aussagekräftige Ergebnisse zu generieren. Die Studie zeigt auf, dass grüne Konsumenten entgegen der gängigen Annahme durchaus materialistisch motiviert sein können. Dies äussert sich in der Verfolgung materialistischer Lebensziele, die mitunter Motiv von grünem Konsum sein können. Diese Erkenntnis zeigt sich auch in einem mit Hilfe einer Cluster-Analyse neu entdeckten Segment. Dieses übt grünes Konsumverhalten aus und misst dem eigenen äusseren Erscheinungsbild (Image) und der Bewunderung durch andere bzw. der eigenen Bekanntheit (Popularity) grosse Wichtigkeit bei. Gleichzeitig vertritt das Segment neben diesen materialistischen Werten auch Werte der Grünen und der VS. Deshalb wird das Segment «Grüne Materialisten mit VS-Tendenz» genannt. Das Vorhandensein dieses Segments zeigt auf, dass grüner Konsum nicht durch ökologisches Denken oder Altruismus motiviert sein muss.

The new Health Insurance Act mandates the introduction of a national tariff system that reflects differences in patient resource use and introduces per-case reimbursements. In this study we developed a prospective payment system (PPS) with a patient classification system and a mixed tariff structure including per-case payments and per-diem rates.Data: Primary data on patient characteristics, cost per episode and daily time spent by medical staff were collected in a survey of ’ patients from  inpatient psychiatric facilities in , two of which were facilities specialized in disorders related to drug use. Patient characteristics include the main psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-) and a weekly assessment of the severity of illness with the Health of Nations Outcome Scales questionnaire (HoNOS) covering dimensions such as aggressive behavior and the independence in activities of daily living.Methods: Predictors of total cost per episode were examined with a multivariate linear regression model. Explanatory variables included main psychiatric diagnosis, HoNOS scores, socio-demographic characteristics, type of insurance plan, compulsory hospitalization and hospital fixed effects. Different mixed tariff structures with (staggered) per-case payments and per-diem rates were evaluated. Per-case payments of varying weight were evaluated and per-diem rates were allowed to vary over length of stay. Goodness-of-fit was measured by an out-of-sample evaluation of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between hypothetical revenues and observed costs per episode.Results: Regression analysis leads to a patient classification system with  psychiatric cost groups (PCGs) based on  psychiatric diagnoses and the HoNOS assessment of severity of illness. The resulting tariff system yields high per-diem payments for the first  days of stay, a per-case payment at day  and a reduced per-diem rate thereafter. The reduced rate is not cost-covering, constituting an incentive to reduce length of stay, while the combination with per-case payment satisfies cost-neutrality of the tariff system as a whole. As some clinics are concerned with special cases of long-term patients, a cost-covering per-diem tariff is introduced after  days of stay (/ days are alternative scenarios). Compared to the uniform per-diem tariff presently in operation in Switzerland, a per-diem system with  PCGs improves the accuracy of the tariff system in predicting actual costs per case. This means the MAPE is lowered from .% to .% in a system where per-case payment is calibrated to zero. The introduction of a per-case payment deteriorates the accuracy of the system.Discussion: The proposed PPS combines incentives for an appropriate provision of care with incentives for a reduction of length of stay. The latter type of incentive however is linked to reduced accuracy of the tariff system. Hence, for policy-makers there clearly is a trade-off between accuracy and setting incentives. A system with per-case payments might also lead to an uneven distribution of revenues across clinics (in particular, if average length of stay varies across clinics).","doc_id":10747,"prior":"Produktion","posterior":"resource use","SDG12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7511","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A simple procedure to synchronize concurrent measurements of gait and brain electrical activity and preliminary results from a pilot measurement involving motor-cognitive dual-tasking in healthy older and young volunteers","authors":"Marcar, Valentine Leslie; Bridenbaugh, Stephanie A.; Kool, Jan; Niedermann Schneider, Karin; Kressig, Reto W.","subject":"Brain Activity; Synchronization; Gait; Concurrent Aging;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"A simple procedure to synchronize concurrent measurements of gait and brain electrical activity and preliminary results from a pilot measurement involving motor-cognitive dual-tasking in healthy older and young volunteers; Brain Activity; Synchronization; Gait; Concurrent Aging;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Background: The ability to record brain activity under normal walking conditions is the key to studying supraspinal influence on spinal gait control.  New method: We developed a procedure of synchronizing an electronic walkway (GAITRite, CIR Systems Inc.) with a multi-channel, wireless EEG-system (BrainAmp, Brainproducts). To assess the practicability of our procedure we performed a proof of concept measurement involving concurrently recording gait pattern and brain electrical activity in two elderly and two young participants. This measurement enabled us to assess the synchronization of the two data sets under realistic conditions.  Results: Only carrying a filled water glass reduced gait regularity in the elderly. In the young gait regularity was constant across all tasks. This concurs with previous findings reporting a task specific influence on gait. Carrying a full water glass also led to an increase in the power of the EEG gamma-band oscillations in frontal cortex of the elderly, but led to a decrease in the young participants. Carrying a full glass increased activity in frontal cortex of the elderly but decreased it in the young participants.  Comparison with existing methods:  At present, concurrent recording of gait pattern and electrical brain activity requires participants to walk on a treadmill. Our procedure enables these measurements to be made under natural walking conditions. This allows measurements of brain activity during walking in special needs groups such as children, the elderly or the infirm under near natural conditions.  Conclusions: Our procedure for synchronizing EEG and gait proved simple, reliable and generated data of high-quality.   ","doc_id":10823,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"69","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/909","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Was erleben Menschen mit einer chronisch körperlichen Krankheit? : eine Studie zur Sensibilisierung für Anliegen von Menschen, die an HIV, MS, Krebs oder Rheuma erkrankt sind","authors":"Rousselot, Aline; Fröhlich-Rüfenacht, Susanne","subject":" Psychologie","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"150","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Was erleben Menschen mit einer chronisch körperlichen Krankheit? : eine Studie zur Sensibilisierung für Anliegen von Menschen, die an HIV, MS, Krebs oder Rheuma erkrankt sind;  Psychologie","doc_id":10871,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20403","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Vogel-Strauss-Justiz?","authors":"Steiger-Sackmann, Sabine","subject":"Beweislast; Missbräuchlich; Kündigung; Gesundheitsschutz;  Öffentliches Recht (CH), Arbeits-, Sozial-, Bildungs- und Kulturrecht","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"344","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Vogel-Strauss-Justiz?; Beweislast; Missbräuchlich; Kündigung; Gesundheitsschutz;  Öffentliches Recht (CH), Arbeits-, Sozial-, Bildungs- und Kulturrecht; Ein Unternehmen foutierte sich jahrelang um die Gesundheit seiner Mitarbeitenden.

Current medical management strategies for keratitis mostly focus on antibacterial effects, but largely neglect the role of excess MMP activity. Here, a cyclic tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) peptidomimetic, which downregulated MMP- expression both at the mRNA and protein levels as well as MMP- activity in THP--derived macrophages, is reported. A similar downregulating effect could also be observed on α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the TIMP peptidomimetic reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced MMP- activity in an ex vivo porcine infectious keratitis model and histological examinations demonstrated that a decrease of corneal thickness, associated with keratitis progression, was inhibited upon peptidomimetic treatment. The presented approach to reduce MMP- activity thus holds great potential to decrease corneal tissue damage and improve the clinical success of current treatment strategies for infectious keratitis.","doc_id":11061,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22019","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Preservation of individuals’ privacy in shared COVID-19 related data","authors":"Sauermann, Stefan; Kanjala, Chifundo; Templ, Matthias; Austin, Claire C.","subject":"Covid-19; Anonymisation;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"005","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Preservation of individuals’ privacy in shared COVID- related data; Covid-; Anonymisation;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; Preprint Version; This paper provides insight into how restricted data can be incorporated in an open-be-default-by-design digital infrastructure for scientific data.

To assess and limit the risk of re-identification of individual persons in COVID- datasets (that are often enriched with other covariates like age, gender, nationality, etc.) to acceptable levels, the risk of successful re-identification by a combination of attribute values must be assessed and controlled.

The enormous implications of that shift on economic, employment, and innovation policies have put the automotive industry in Germany and Europe under pressure. This is happening at a time when the industry is on an expansion course, with rising sales, growing employment, and increasing exports.Our mobility is undergoing change from strong and globally relevant megatrends, new mobility needs in urbanising transport markets, and hitherto unknown forms of competition, for instance from the up-and-coming IT sector, but also from China's industrial policy objectives. The concomitant trends towards electrification, networking, automation, and sharing are revolutionising the automotive industry and will lead to a new form of automobility. Fossil-fuel based propulsion is being replaced by electromotive motors and batteries; the notion of driving the car yourself is being replaced by concepts of assisted, automated, and autonomous driving, and ownership is being replaced by a digital platform ecology with new business models and forms of distribution.The cumulative effect of those developments on the automotive industry in Germany and Europe has been dramatic changes in supply and demand, which have cast doubt on previous business models. These transformation processes can no longer be managed with automotive policy regulation and internal corporate self-transformation. Governments, companies, trade unions, and consumers must work together to promote change in the automotive sector.That can only succeed with a mobility pact for the future that combines entrepreneurial, political, and social strategies with the aim of transforming transport in society as a whole. It stands in the tradition of cooperative management of economic, social, and societal change. The guiding political principle behind this shift must be to create a sustainable and integrated overall transport system that includes the automobile as a building block in intermodal transport and action chains.The onus is on the federal government as the central state actor to coordinate and moderate the processes in concert with the German states and municipalities. It must create the regulatory, fiscal, and structural policy framework for action, while private enterprise and policymakers should encourage society at large to discuss a future mobility pact through a transparent consultation mechanism.As a first step, a politically moderated and regulated consumer-side market transformation programme for electric mobility should be set up and implemented. The key concern here is to shape consumer behaviour in such a way as to generate demand for new and future-oriented products. At the European level, for example, the pact for the future should involve initiating a project aimed at making the technological leap towards electric mobility. In addition, as part of the market transformation programme, municipalities must be more strongly and comprehensively empowered to promote communal laboratories in which both the car industry and public transport operators can develop new forms of cooperation with a view to new mobility.","doc_id":11433,"prior":"consumer behaviour","SDG12":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24650","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Dynamic pricing for hedonic and utilitarian purchases : the impact of magnitude of price difference and price level on perceived price fairness","authors":"Zhao, Yan","subject":" Marketingmanagement","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"658.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Dynamic pricing for hedonic and utilitarian purchases : the impact of magnitude of price difference and price level on perceived price fairness;  Marketingmanagement; Dynamic pricing is widely adopted in e-commerce for its effectiveness in enhancing revenue and profitability. Nowadays, firms increasingly focus on advancing their dynamic pricing models by examining consumer behavior patterns with the help of emerging technologies and increasing data availability. However, the economic benefits of dynamic pricing may be at the expense of damaging companies' reputations through violation of price fairness, resulting in jeopardizing sustainable development. Dynamic pricing should not be implemented disregarding the consumers’ price fairness perceptions.This study aims to explore price fairness perceptions in the condition of dynamic pricing incorporating individual motivational factors. The present research conceptualizes and tests a research model with the impact of different dynamic pricing mechanisms (i.e. magnitude of price difference and product price level) on consumers’ perceived price fairness across buyers with different purchase motives. The magnitude of price difference covers the depth of price changes, and product price level depicts the starting point of price changes. Purchase motive (i.e. hedonic vs. utilitarian) is a consumer-centered, intrinsic factor representing the underlying motivation of a purchase. The effect of perceived price fairness on consumers’ strategic price tracking behavior is also examined.The data was collected through a between-subjects, factorial-design online experiment with two levels of magnitude of price difference (major vs. minor) × two levels of product price level (high vs. low) × two levels of purchase motive (hedonic vs. utilitarian). This study focuses on disadvantaged price inequality with the comparative reference price of “other buyers”. Moreover, respondents evaluated the perceived price fairness in the postpurchase stage (i.e. after purchasing the product). Participants were recruited though an American online-access panel.It is confirmed that the magnitude of price difference and product price level are salient predictors for perceived price fairness. By contrast, consumers’ purchase motives (hedonic vs. utilitarian) do not elicit different judgments on price fairness. This study also finds that with the development of price investigation technologies and the trend of conscious consumers, perceived price unfairness can induce a higher intention of strategic price tracking behavior among buyers. Consumers no longer passively accept unfair deals or only take action after purchasing the products; they endeavor to become more strategic to take advantage of the sellers. Future research could examine the interplay of price change magnitude, product price level, and price change frequency in an algorithmic model integrating consumers’ price fairness considerations. In addition, the role of purchase motive on perceived price fairness in the pre-purchase stage of the customer journey could be further investigated in the context of discriminatory pricing.","doc_id":11476,"prior":"consumer behavior","SDG12":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20996","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Biocatalysis in the Swiss manufacturing environment","authors":"Hecht, Katrin; Meyer, Hans-Peter; Wohlgemuth, Roland; Buller, Rebecca","subject":"Industrial biocatalysis; Drug shortage; Enzyme technology; Switzerland;  Biotechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660.6","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Biocatalysis in the Swiss manufacturing environment; Industrial biocatalysis; Drug shortage; Enzyme technology; Switzerland;  Biotechnologie; Biocatalysis has undergone a remarkable transition in the last two decades, from being considered a niche technology to playing a much more relevant role in organic synthesis today.

Digital smart meters hold many advantages over traditional analog meters, and smart metering is one of application of IoT technology. It supports the conventional power system in adopting modern concepts like smart grids, block-chains, automation, etc. due to their remote load monitoring and control capabilities. However, in many applications, the traditional analog meters still are preferred over digital smart meters due to the high deployment and operating costs, and the unreliability of the smart meters. The primary reasons behind these issues are a lack of a reliable and affordable communication system, which can be addressed by the deployment of a dedicated network formed with a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) platform like wireless radio standards (i.e., LoRa devices). This paper discusses LoRa technology and its implementation to solve the problems associated with smart metering, especially considering the rural energy system. A simulation-based study has been done to analyse the LoRa technology’s applicability in different architecture for smart metering purposes and to identify a cost-effective and reliable way to implement smart metering, especially in a rural microgrid (MG).","doc_id":11566,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1832","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Living in a field of tension between development and degeneration : a grounded theory study of family transitions and neuromuscular disease","authors":"Waldboth, Veronika","subject":" Pflege;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie","type":"Dissertation","bid":"610.73, 616.7","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Living in a field of tension between development and degeneration : a grounded theory study of family transitions and neuromuscular disease;  Pflege;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie","doc_id":11587,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14321","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Life cycle assessment of future photovoltaic electricity production from residential-scale systems operated in Europe","authors":"Frischknecht, Rolf; Itten, René; Wyss, Franziska; Blanc, Isabelle; Heath, Garvin; Raugei, Marco; Sinha, Parikhit; Wade, Andreas","subject":"LCA; Photovoltaic; Future; Residential; Europe; Crystalline;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"621.3","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Life cycle assessment of future photovoltaic electricity production from residential-scale systems operated in Europe; LCA; Photovoltaic; Future; Residential; Europe; Crystalline;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; http://iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=; The photovoltaics (PV) industry is growing rapidly to meet the increasing demand of green power. As the industry grows, the manufacturing processes and the material and energy efficiencies of PV cells and panels are improving. To assess the impacts of this trend, future scenarios of single-crystalline (single-Si, also known as mono-crystalline) silicon and cadmium-telluride (CdTe) PV systems installed on European residences were established. Assessment of the improvement potential of PV electricity-generating technologies such as single-Si and CdTe could be considered in long-term energy strategy decisions.This study aims to provide scenario-based information about the environmental performance of single-Si and CdTe PV modules produced and operated in the far future ( to ). The deployment application assessed considers European residential roofs. We made scenario-dependent projections of key parameters for single-Si and CdTe PV panels manufactured in . The parameters included cell efficiency, module efficiency, wafer thickness, cutting losses, kerf losses, silver use, glass thickness and operational lifetime.This study combines developments for these parameters with projections of the environmental performance of electricity mixes in the main manufacturing countries/regions (European Union, China and the United States of America) and with projections of the environmental performance of basic material production (aluminium, copper, magnesium, nickel, pig iron, zinc, clinker and flat glass) in the far future. The three scenarios used in the assessment of future PV electricity were categorized into three classes: “business as usual” (BAU), “realistic improvement” (REAL) and “optimistic improvement” (OPT).It estimates the current life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of single-Si PV electricity produced on the roofs of European residences to be approximately  grams CO-equivalent per kWh (g CO-eq per kWh). Based on the projected changes to key parameters and the background system, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be reduced to  % (scenario BAU),  % (scenario REAL) and  % (scenario OPT) of that value in the far future.Results for other life cycle assessment (LCA) metrics are also assessed in this study such as: non-renewable cumulative energy demand, acidification potential, human toxicity potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, particulate matter formation potential, and land use.We calculated the total energy payback time (EPBT) and the non-renewable energy payback time (NREPBT) in the far future of single-crystalline silicon-based PV panels operated in Europe by dividing the estimate of non-renewable cumulative energy demand of PV electricity for the given scenario by the non-renewable cumulative energy demand of the scenario-dependent national and regional non-renewable residual electricity mixes.The study estimates the payback time could be reduced from . years today to ., . and . years (scenarios BAU, REAL and OPT, respectively) in the far future, based on the assumptions and projections in the analysis.It finally estimates the current life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of CdTe PV electricity produced on the roofs of European residences to be approximately  g CO-eq per kWh.

The aim of the present study is to describe the social conditions along the global supply chains and to compare them with the social situation in Switzerland. Therefore, a specific S-LCA methodology was developed that combines a relevance analysis with a performance reference point (PRP) assessment. The relevance analysis is carried out to identify the most relevant unit processes and S-LCA indicators and the Swiss PRPs (SPRPs) are designed to compare the social issues along the value chain to the situation in Switzerland. The methodology was applied to two life cycle stages of the copper supply chain (resource extraction and wire production), relevant for the production of renewable energy technologies, where it was found that the most critical step is mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to the artisanal way of mining. The proposed methodology offers a comprehensive overview for the analysis of supply chains and the comparison of different life cycle phases.

Information on the cardiopulmonary and gas exchange responses to the MWT is limited. Objectives: We aimed to analyze the breath-by-breath cardiopulmonary and gas exchange responses of patients with COPD during the MWT. We also investigated the extent to which parameters reflecting cardiopulmonary and gas exchange function are associated with exercise capacity. Methods: The oxygen uptake (VO) kinetics of patients were obtained using mobile telemetric cardiopulmonary monitoring during a MWT. A new mean response time (MRT) index was developed to quantify VO on-kinetics by correcting MRT for work rate (wMRT). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between variables reflecting cardiopulmonary and gas exchange function and exercise capacity [-min walking distance (MWD) and VO at steady state (VOSS)]. Results: In  COPD patients ( females) with a mean (SD) age of  () years, FEV  () % predicted exercise capacity as assessed by VOSS (p = .) was significantly reduced across the stages of COPD. The criteria for maximal effort during the MWT were fulfilled by % of the patients. After adjustment for covariates, wMRT was independently associated with MWD (p = . × -) and VOSS (p = . × -). Conclusions: As wMRT mostly depends on the rate of increase of pulmonary blood flow, our results underline the fact that cardiocirculatory function may play a significant role in exercise tolerance in patients with COPD.

Although the literature has shown promising efforts in this direction, reported results do not consider the variability of CT scans acquired under varying circumstances, thus rendering resulting models unfit for use on data acquired using e.g. different scanner technologies. While COVID- diagnosis can now be done efficiently using PCR tests, this use case exemplifies the need for a methodology to overcome data variability issues in order to make medical image analysis models more widely applicable. In this paper, we explicitly address the variability issue using the example of COVID- diagnosis and propose a novel generative approach that aims at erasing the differences induced by e.g. the imaging technology while simultaneously introducing minimal changes to the CT scans through leveraging the idea of deep autoencoders. The proposed prepossessing architecture (PrepNet) (i) is jointly trained on multiple CT scan datasets and (ii) is capable of extracting improved discriminative features for improved diagnosis.

Currently, three major strategies are evolving. Firstly, various pharmacological agents (growth factors, interleukins, small molecules, DNA/RNA) are locally applied at the ischemic region. Secondly, preparations of living cells with considerable bandwidth of tissue origin, differentiation state and preconditioning are delivered locally, rarely systemically. Thirdly, based on the notion, that cellular effects can be attributed mostly to factors secreted in situ, the cellular secretome (conditioned media, exosomes) has come into the spotlight. We review these three strategies to achieve (neo)angiogenesis in ischemic tissue with focus on the angiogenic mechanisms they tackle, such as transcription cascades, specific signalling steps and cellular gases. We also include cancer-therapy relevant lymphangiogenesis, and shall seek to explain why there are often conflicting data between in vitro and in vivo. The lion's share of data encompassing all three approaches comes from experimental animal work and we shall highlight common technical obstacles in the delivery of therapeutic molecules, cells, and secretome. This plethora of preclinical data contrasts with a dearth of clinical studies. A lack of adequate delivery vehicles and standardised assessment of clinical outcomes might play a role here, as well as regulatory, IP, and manufacturing constraints of candidate compounds; in addition, completed clinical trials have yet to reveal a successful and efficacious strategy. As the biology of angiogenesis is understood well enough for clinical purposes, it will be a matter of time to achieve success for well-stratified patients, and most probably with a combination of compounds.","doc_id":12614,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12712","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Health economic modelling of the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in Switzerland","authors":"Kessler, Reto; Keusch, Gérard; Szucs, Thomas; Wittenborn, John; Hoerger, Thomas; Brügger, Urs; Wieser, Simon","subject":"Albuminuria; Cost-benefit analysis; Disease progression; Follow-up study; Mass screening; Prevalence; Retrospective study; Economic models;  Gesundheitsökonomie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362.1041","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Health economic modelling of the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in Switzerland; Albuminuria; Cost-benefit analysis; Disease progression; Follow-up study; Mass screening; Prevalence; Retrospective study; Economic models;  Gesundheitsökonomie; Principles: Current evidence indicates that chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be detected by simple laboratory tests. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening and subsequent treatment in different populations. Methods: Cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in a cohort of simulated subjects aged ≥ years was assessed using a validated microsimulation model. Microalbuminuria screening was simulated for -, -, - or -year intervals and for  groups: diabetes (DM), hypertension but no diabetes (HTN), and no diabetes or hypertension. Positive microalbuminuria screening was followed by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The model outcomes evaluate costs from a health care system perspective.Results: Screening of risk groups is cost-effective at a -year interval for the DM group with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of , CHF/ Quality Adjusted-Life-Years (QALY) and at a -year interval for the HTN group with an ICER of ,CHF/QALY . Screening of the remaining population is cost-effective at a -year interval with an ICER of , CHF/QALY . The ICER improves with longer screening intervals for all groups. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) confirmed -year, -year and -year intervals as the most cost-effective for the DM group, the HTN group and the remaining population respectively.Conclusions: Microalbuminuria screening can be considered cost-effective starting at the age of  years at biannual intervals for subjects with diabetes, at -year intervals for subjects with hypertension and at-year intervals for the remaining population.

Thrombus formation and chronic inflammation are integral to disease progression, driven by blood flow energy. The interplay between flow energy, blood clotting and remodeling of the tissue is key to an enhanced disease understanding, to improve patient counseling and ultimately endovascular treatment planning. Current concepts suggest that blood governs wall remodeling by multiple biological steps. The process starts with flow induced thrombus adhesion (atherothrombosis) to the wall that secondarily leads to the release of biological mediators of inflammation entertaining destructive remodeling. Destructive wall remodeling jeopardizes the mechanical wall integrity with ensuing circumscribed softening and expansion of the aneurysm shape. The shape of an aneurysm is the visible result of these complex pathological processes and characterizes its disease status. Wall adherent thrombus formation, inflammatory reactions and the driving force of blood flow cause lumen shape changes. Here, shape irregularity is a distinctive sign of focal wall weakening. The integration of shape-analysis,vascular biology and phenotypical information will allow for personalized characterization of aneurysmal vascular disease and help to identify and establish shape as an image-based biomarker. Future translational efforts should aim at providing adequate IT tools and contributing to validation and disease understanding. Ensuing results will have a high likelihood to impact significantly on current clinical disease management.","doc_id":12662,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23100","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"A citizen’s guide to the rule of law : why we need to fight for the most precious human invention of all time","authors":"Merdzanovic, Adis; Nicolaidis, Kalypso","subject":" Recht","type":"Buch","bid":"340","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"A citizen’s guide to the rule of law : why we need to fight for the most precious human invention of all time;  Recht; The rule of law really matters. But like oxygen, we only know it when it is missing. In fact, we hope to convince our readers in these pages that it is the most precious human invention of all time, pervading our daily lives. When we buy something in the shop, when we pay our rent, when we meet each other for a chat in a pub, or when we march in protest, we trust in the rule of law to protect us from governmental overreach, mafia godfathers, or the will of the majority in our society. As we take the rule of law for granted, we fail to see when it’s under attack. And under attack it is around the world. Indeed, the rule of law may be blatantly mocked and trampled in places far from Europe, from Hong Kong to Venezuela, or in its neighbourhood, from Ankara to Algiers. But, rule-of-lawlessness has also become a European disease. This book is written in Europe, by two Europeans, with a focus on what is going on in Europe, both in the European Union and in countries aspiring to become members. But we hope that the book is relevant beyond Europe and beyond the challenges of EU enlargement. We will discuss developments in some specific countries in this book, but neither in detail not in the necessary depth these cases would deserve. Our goal is to explore the rule of law and its contemporary challenges, not to discuss the intricacies of any particular circumstances of its breach. Why is this ‘a citizen’s guide’? Because we explore this state of affairs from the point of view of citizens; citizens who want to understand what it is, why it is under attack, why this matters to them and what they can do about it. If you care about freedom in our age but do not care for abstract jargon, this book is for you. While taking the issues seriously, we try to treat them with some levity so as to make concepts accessible and practicable. Throughout the book, we have added explanations of some important concepts in side boxes, which are meant as much to amuse as to explain. We speak to rule of law newcomers as well professionals, bureaucrats, and NGO activists and NGO activists, who are already engaged in this field and have done so much to defend the rule of law. Above all, we offer this book to any citizen curious about the meaning of this seemingly technical term and perhaps, hopefully, wishing to spread the word. The book draws in part on a  publication prepared for the EU at the behest of the OECD and we are grateful to its co-author, Rachel Kleinfeld, for her contribution at the time. Here, we have both substantially updated and roadened the initial perspective by exploring the current context which has heightened its demise, namely the rise of illiberalism and the decline of democracy in the Western Balkans and beyond. The book also assesses some positive steps taken by the EU in recent years, offers further recommendations and in doing so, hopes to empower citizens who seek to resist regression and entrench progress. We wish to thank all our friends and colleagues with whom we have discussed these ideas in the past few years. In particular, we thank Dorian Singh for her assistance in finalising the manuscript. Adis Merdzanovic wishes to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation for supporting this research. And we wish to wholeheartedly thank the team at ibidem, in particular Valerie Lange, for their patience with us, their commitment to the subject, and their support throughout the publication process.

They are also among the first countries for which total health care spending has been disaggregated by comparable health conditions. This study explores the main similarities and differences in spending by disease in the US and Switzerland and the factors that may be driving the differences. Methods: We compared two recent studies disaggregating national health care spending by diseases in the US and in Switzerland. Both studies categorized diseases according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Spending was compared over  exhaustive and mutually exclusive major diseases. Double counting was avoided by restricting spending to the overall total spending for each type of care. Nationally representative data sources were used to assign spending to diseases (hospital registry data, health insurance claims data, household surveys, etc.). Health care spending was compared in three ways: ) the proportion of disease-specific spending to total spending, ) the proportion of each disease-specific spending on each service category, and ) the spending per prevalent case for each disease.Results: Patterns in spending were dominated by similarities between the two countries. ) Non-communicable diseases constituted  percent of spending in the US and  percent in Switzerland. Cardiovascular diseases was the disease category with the most spending in both countries, followed by mental and substance use disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and injures. The proportion of spending on most other disease groups were of similar magnitude. For example, cancers constituted  percent of spending in both the US and in Switzerland. ) The share of inpatient care spending was higher in Switzerland for most diseases and in particular for mental and substance use disorders and injuries. ) Spending per prevalent case was similar for most diseases. Four diseases had yearly spending above , USD in both countries (cirrhosis, congenital anomalies, digestive diseases, and cardiovascular diseases).Discussion: Our research highlights the similarities in health care spending by major diseases in the US and in Switzerland. The ranking of diseases by share in total spending as well as the spending per prevalent case are much alike. Differences in spending by diseases may be due to differences in the disease prevalence (higher for diabetes in the US), in the access to care (better for mental and substance use disorders in Switzerland), and age structure of the population (higher share of elderly in Switzerland).

Clean technologies, such as renewable energies, have the potential to significantly reduce these environmental repercussions of agriculture. Countries like South Africa have a coal intensive electricity mix, as well as high solar irradiation and a dry climate which is why agricultural crops are produced under fossil energy intensive irrigation. At the same time, the high solar irradiation could be used for the generation of photovoltaic electricity as a renewable power supply for irrigation. A joint research project between the University of Cape Town and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences quantified the environmental impacts of South African maize production (Zea mays) and the improvement potential of maize irrigation with photovoltaic electricity by means of life cycle assessment (LCA).The LCA includes the whole value chain of maize production from cultivation to storage in a silo for six months, respectively with a functional unit of one kilogram of maize at silo storage produced either on dry land or under irrigation. Electricity consumption for irrigation was identified as an environmental hotspot in the impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions from maize production. Therefore, clean electricity would be the starting point to reduce the carbon footprint of South Africa’s maize. We calculated that replacement of South African electricity mix with photovoltaic electricity in the maize irrigation can reduce environmental impacts by up to %. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of maize on dry land without irrigation, under irrigation and under irrigation using photovoltaic electricity, are . kg CO-eq. and . kg CO-eq. and . kg CO-eq., respectively, with a potential reduction of % if the electricity is supplied from photovoltaics compared to the conventional fossil electricity mix. The analysis of further indicators reveals a reduction for non-renewable energy demand (nuclear and fossil), acidification, freshwater eutrophication and human toxicity of carcinogenic substances. The irrigation of a maize field of one hectare consumes ' kWh of electricity per year, which, in turn, requires a solar power plant with an area of  m. We computed that a total area of  ha of solar panels would suffice to produce the total electricity requirement of the current maize production area under irrigation. This corresponds to more than approximately ' t CO-eq. saved per year.Compared to data representing maize production in the United States and in Switzerland, South African maize production has a higher global warming potential per kilogram of maize due to lower yields in South Africa.The replacement of the South African electricity mix in the irrigation with electricity from photovoltaics has proven to be an effective clean technology to reduce environmental impacts associated with maize production in South Africa. Compared to the irrigated field area, land use for PV panels is almost negligible and is therefore no limiting factor in the implementation of irrigation using photovoltaic electricity.","doc_id":12771,"prior":"life cycle assessment","SDG12":1},{"id":"80","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1112","date":"2016","language":"de","title":"Auswirkungen chronischer Nackenschmerzen auf die Lungenfunktion : Mögliche Auswirkungen und physiotherapeutische Relevanz","authors":"Ritz, Katja; Schär, Giuliana","subject":"Chronic neck pain; Cervical dysfunction; Respiratory; Pulmonary disease; Hypocapnia;  Physiotherapie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.82","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Auswirkungen chronischer Nackenschmerzen auf die Lungenfunktion : Mögliche Auswirkungen und physiotherapeutische Relevanz; Chronic neck pain; Cervical dysfunction; Respiratory; Pulmonary disease; Hypocapnia;  Physiotherapie; Einleitung: Chronische Lungenerkrankungen führen durch das Verändern des Atemmusters und durch Atemhilfsstellungen zu Nackenschmerzen.

Environmental legislation, on the other hand, only started to be enacted in the s. On this basis, the concept of CSR as it is practiced today—predominantly referred to as ‘sustainability’—became established after the year .The Swiss economy is based on the concept of a liberal economic system. This results in a policy of a minimalist state establishing the necessary framework—effective environmental legislation and protective social and labor laws—for the economy itself to follow. The state thus plays a minor role in regulating CSR, which is seen as business-driven. Compared to other European countries, the Swiss have fewer statutory requirements for CSR activities (e.g. reporting). However, the government promotes moderate CSR by providing guidelines and incentives for appropriate behavior (State Secretariat for Economic Affairs [SECO], a). In addition, Switzerland’s economy is seen as highly globalized with a strong export orientation.

Environmental legislation, on the other hand, only started to be enacted in the s. On this basis, the concept of CSR as it is practiced today—predominantly referred to as ‘sustainability’—became established after the year .The Swiss economy is based on the concept of a liberal economic system. This results in a policy of a minimalist state establishing the necessary framework—effective environmental legislation and protective social and labor laws—for the economy itself to follow. The state thus plays a minor role in regulating CSR, which is seen as business-driven. Compared to other European countries, the Swiss have fewer statutory requirements for CSR activities (e.g. reporting). However, the government promotes moderate CSR by providing guidelines and incentives for appropriate behavior (State Secretariat for Economic Affairs [SECO], a). In addition, Switzerland’s economy is seen as highly globalized with a strong export orientation. Hence, most Swiss companies operate in an international context where they depend on, and at the same time profit from, globalized supply chains.

The Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale for Dementia (IPOS-Dem) is the first comprehensive person-centered measure to identify and measure palliative care needs of people with dementia. However, such a measure is missing in the German health care system.Aim: To develop a culturally adapted German version of the IPOS-Dem and determine its content validity as a foundation for comprehensive psychometric testing.Design: Cognitive interview study with intermittent analysis and questionnaire adaptation. Interview guide and coding frame followed thematic analysis according to Willis complemented by Tourangeau’s model of cognitive aspects of survey methodology: comprehension, retrieval, judgment, response.Participants: Purposive sample with professionals (n = ) and family carers (n = ) of people with advanced dementia in seven nursing homes and person’s own home care in four interview rounds (n = ; ; ; ).Results: IPOS-Dem was regarded as comprehensive and accessible. Cultural adaption pertained to issues of comprehension and judgment. Comprehension challenges referred to the person-centered concept of “being affected by” used in the POS-measures. Judgment problems related to persons with limited communication causing challenges in assessment.Conclusion: Most issues of cultural adaptation could be addressed by questionnaire modifications. However, interviews unveiled fundamental challenges for using proxy reported person-centered assessments. Continuous training on how to use the instrument is imperative to integrate the person-centered approach of palliative care into nursing homes as a key provider of generalist palliative care for people with dementia. The refined version is ready for psychometric testing.","doc_id":13123,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"67","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21644","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Expansive networks : exploiting spectrum sharing for capacity boost and 6G vision","authors":"Gür, Gürkan","subject":"6G/Beyond 5G networks; DLT; Expansive networks; Spectrum sharing; Network intelligence;  Informatik;  Elektro-, Kommunikations-, Steuerungs- und Regelungstechnik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"004, 621.3","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Expansive networks : exploiting spectrum sharing for capacity boost and G vision; G/Beyond G networks; DLT; Expansive networks; Spectrum sharing; Network intelligence;  Informatik;  Elektro-, Kommunikations-, Steuerungs- und Regelungstechnik; Adaptive capacity with cost-efficient resource provisioning is a crucial capability for future G networks.

Analyses reveal an-on average-five-fold higher data packet loss for sub-surface nodes, which steadily grows with increasing distance to the gateway.

Third, we illustrate the usefulness of the newly developed concept by evaluating the radio transmission performance for two independent full-scale field tests. Test results show that the synchronous LoRa mesh network approach clearly outperforms the standard LoRaWAN technique with regard to the reliability of packet delivery when transmitting from range-critical locations. Hence, the approach is expected to generally ease data collection from difficult-to-access locations such as underground areas.","doc_id":13945,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24102","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Rhizobiom-Management auf Golf Greens","authors":"Rieger, Lorenz","subject":" Pflanzenkrankheiten, Schädlinge","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"632","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Rhizobiom-Management auf Golf Greens; Rhizobiome engineering in golf greens management;  Pflanzenkrankheiten, Schädlinge; Increasingly restrictive legislation and rising costs of disease control are raising the need for eco-friendly approaches in plant protection.

As an aneurysm's D shape is strongly dependent on the underlying formation processes, it is believed that the presence of certain shape features mirrors the disease status of the aneurysm wall. Currently, clinicians associate irregular shape with wall instability. However, no consensus exists about which shape features reliably predict instability. In this study, we present a benchmark to identify shape features providing the highest predictive power for aneurysm rupture status.Methods: D models of aneurysms were extracted from medical imaging data (D rotational angiographies) using a standardized protocol. For these aneurysm models, we calculated a set of metrics characterizing the D shape: Geometry indices (such as undulation, ellipticity and non-sphericity); writhe- and curvature-based metrics; as well as indices based on Zernike moments. Using statistical learning methods, we investigated the association between shape features and aneurysm disease status. This processing was applied to a clinical dataset of  aneurysms ( ruptured,  unruptured) registered in the AneuX morphology database. We report here statistical performance metrics [including the area under curve (AUC)] for morphometric models to discriminate between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.Results: The non-sphericity index NSI (AUC = .), normalized Zernike energies ZsurfN (AUC = .) and the modified writhe-index WLmean (AUC = .) exhibited the strongest association with rupture status. The combination of predictors further improved the predictive performance (without location: AUC = ., with location AUC = .). The anatomical location was a good predictor for rupture status on its own (AUC = .). Different protocols to isolate the aneurysm dome did not affect the prediction performance. We identified problems regarding generalizability if trained models are applied to datasets with different selection biases.Conclusions: Morphology provided a clear indication of the aneurysm disease status, with parameters measuring shape (especially irregularity) being better predictors than size.

Subjective QoL as well as family support and family functioning were measured with patients and family members. Patients and their relatives assessed the patients' support need and their satisfaction with the care provided. In addition, patients were administered a disease-related HRQoL measure (QoLIED-, Version ). Backward stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis was used to explain variances in patients and relatives' subjective QoL. Results: One hundred and four dyads of patient and family member participated. Subjective QoL in patients and family members differed significantly, as did satisfaction with care delivery. In both groups family support contributed significantly to QoL. In the models % of the variance in QoL in patients and relatives could be explained. While the quality of life of the family members was affected by the patients' knowledge about the disease and the reason for their current hospitalization, patient QoL scores had no influence on the QoL of family members. The patients' QoL, however, depended significantly on the QoL of the family members. Conclusion: Interventions should address both PWE and family members and focus on the self-care improvement of PWE and the well-being and coping of family members. A patient-centred approach needs to include both the PWE and the relatives and address family support in order to alleviate stress in the patients and relatives alike.","doc_id":14469,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16475","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Monitoring of building constructions with passive RFID technology","authors":"Brunner, Basil; Küng, Roland; Strässler, Daniel","subject":"Batteryless sensor; Passive HF-RFID; Energy harvesting; IoT;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004, 621.3","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Monitoring of building constructions with passive RFID technology; Batteryless sensor; Passive HF-RFID; Energy harvesting; IoT;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; The effective monitoring of building constructions increases the safety, cuts down on maintenance costs and builds a solid basis for sustainability. Therefore a reliable and uncomplicated acquisition of meaningful sensor data from modules embedded into the constructions are vital. A passive RFID based sensor system that measures mechanical stress in reinforcing steel was developed at the Centre for Signal Processing and Communications Engineering (ZSN) at the ZHAW University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland. The system enables the monitoring of building structures over their whole lifespan (> years).The newly developed compact strain sensor operates wireless and can therefore be completely embedded in concrete in comparison to older systems, which were wire bound. The project was initiated by enertec engineering AG, Switzerland.To perform a measurement the loop antenna of the portable RFID reader is held over the surface of the building structure. Energy harvesting from the . MHz RF-field delivers the necessary power for operating the batteryless sensor. The strain is converted to an electrical signal with  Ω strain gauges in bridge configuration. The signal is afterwards amplified, digitised and stored in an EEPROM. The worldwide RFID standard ISO  at a frequency of . MHz is used for the communication of commands and for reading out the stored data. A Windows based graphical user interface (GUI) is used to configure the sensor and display the measured data as well as to connect the sensor to the IoT.The sensor has an accuracy of well under  MPa in a measuring range of ± MPa. A reader with  Watt transmission power can identify the sensor up to a distance of  cm. The maximum measuring distance is  cm, limited by the wireless transfer of the harvesting energy. This is a triplication of other known systems on the market due to efficient energy harvesting circuit and using a very low power electronic design. For monitoring dynamic processes, e.g. strain changes of a passing truck, it is possible to capture up to  samples per second.A field test was successfully carried out on a newly built bridge. The ease of installation together with the benefit of a fully connector-less sensor in concrete are important success factors for intelligent construction projects.","doc_id":14609,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20732","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Effekt vom Lokomat® auf die Gehfähigkeit bei Multipler Sklerose Patienten/-innen im Vergleich zur konventionellen Physiotherapie","authors":"Bonicalza, Jessica; Mosimann, Julia","subject":"Multiple Sclerosis; Physical therapy; Robot-assisted gait training;  Physiotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.82, 616.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Effekt vom Lokomat® auf die Gehfähigkeit bei Multipler Sklerose Patienten/-innen im Vergleich zur konventionellen Physiotherapie; Multiple Sclerosis; Physical therapy; Robot-assisted gait training;  Physiotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Darstellung des Themas:  Der Lokomat® ist ein robotergestutztes Trainingsgerat, welches die Gehfähigkeit von Patienten/-innen mit neurologischen Erkrankungen verbessern soll.

The outcome of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) on walking capacity varies between different studies. This essay compiles the results of several studies to provide a broad picture of RAGT’s impact.Aim:   The aim of this paper is to determine if RAGT is more beneficial to walking capacity in multiple sclerosis patients than conventional overground walking training (CT) and to establish a recommendation for the physiotherapeutic practice.Methods:  Literature research was conducted in CINAHL und Medline via (OvidSP). Based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria, five studies were selected.Results:  Overall, RAGT is not significantly more effective than CT to improve walking for people with multiple sclerosis in all evaluated assessments (MWT, BBS, TUG und FSS). The improvements during the treatment periods are in range of the measurement error of the assessments.Conclusion:  Based on the results of this paper, effectiveness to train walking capacity with the Lokomat® could not be demonstrated as greater than with use of CT. Therefore, no explicit recommendation can be made for the physiotherapeutic practice of RAGT.","doc_id":14627,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"55","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16973","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Long-term follow-up of the SAPALDIA cohort : new insights into chronic disease","authors":"Meier, Flurina; Kriemler, Susi; Imboden, Medea; Dratva, Julia; Rochat, Thierry; Probst-Hensch, Nicole","subject":" Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"616","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Long-term follow-up of the SAPALDIA cohort : new insights into chronic disease;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Nearly % of the adult disease burden is attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCD).

Doch für die Produktion wird eine hohe Menge an Ressourcen und Energie benötigt, welches zu einer Umweltbelastung führt. Mit einer Verlängerung der Nutzungs- sowie der Lebensdauer der Geräte kann die Abfallerzeugung sowie der Ressourcen- und Energieverbrauch minimiert und die Kreislaufeffizienz erhöht werden, welches im gesamten die Umweltbelastung reduziert. Die Verlängerung der Nutzungs- sowie Lebensdauer können durch Massnahmen, wie das Teilen, der Wiederverwendung, das Reparieren und der Wiederaufbereitung erzielt werden.Die vorliegende Thesis untersucht den Entscheidungsprozess der Reparaturshops bei einem Reparaturfall in der Deutschschweiz. Dabei werden autorisierte sowie nicht autorisierte Reparaturstellen in Betracht gezogen. Durch die gesamtheitliche Betrachtung des Entscheidungsprozesses werden Kriterien für die Beurteilung der Reparierbarkeit sowie Limitationen bei der Durchführbarkeit einer Reparatur eruiert. Gleichzeitig wird beim Beratungsprozess untersucht, ob und welche Empfehlungen den Kundinnen und Kunden durch die Reparaturshops gemacht werden. Abschliessend werden dabei die Unterschiede zwischen den autorisierten und nicht autorisierten Reparaturshops dargestellt. Um diese forschungsleitenden Fragen zu beantworten, wurden Interviews mit acht Expertinnen und Experten aus dem Reparaturbereich durchgeführt.Die Erkenntnisse aus den Interviews zeigen, dass bei der Bewertung der Reparierbarkeit die Kundenentscheidung, die Kostensicht, Garantie und Versicherung, diverse Richtlinien, die Durchlaufzeit sowie das Kriterium der Verlängerung der Nutzungs- und Lebensdauer beachtet werden. Die Reparierbarkeit wird jedoch von internen und externen Limitationen beeinträchtigt. Des Weiteren werden die Kundinnen und Kunden von allen befragten Reparaturshops beraten und erhalten entsprechende Empfehlungen. Dabei werden die Investitionsmöglichkeiten für Neugeräte oder wiederaufbereitete Mobiltelefone aufgezeigt. Auch werden die Nutzerinnen und Nutzer durch die Reparaturshops mit Bedienungshilfen unterstützt, wobei in einigen Fällen auch Reparaturen somit umgangen werden können. Zwischen den autorisierten und nicht autorisierten Reparaturshops sind ebenfalls Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Garantie, der Qualität, der Wahrnehmung durch die Kundinnen und Kunden sowie der Durchlaufzeit zu beobachten.Die Verlängerung der Nutzungs- und Lebensdauer der Mobiltelefone können durch Reparaturen gefördert werden und dies führt zur Reduktion der Umweltbelastung. Damit so viele Mobiltelefone wie möglich im Kreislauf behalten werden können, wird die aktive Rückförderung der Reparaturshops, der nicht mehr gebrauchten Geräte, als optimal betrachtet. Ferner sind schnelle und unkomplizierte Reparaturprozesse einzuführen, damit die Hemmschwelle für die Kundinnen und Kunden für die Durchführung der Reparaturen minimiert wird.

Cancer related fatigue is a complex symptom that is not yet explained completely and there are only a few remedies with proven evidence. Patients do not necessarily follow a treatment plan with regular follow ups. As a consequence, physicians lack of knowledge how their patients are coping with their fatigue in daily life. To overcome this knowledge gap, we developed a smartphone-based monitoring system. A developed Android app provides activity data from smartphone sensors and applies experience based sampling to collect the patients’ subjective perceptions of their fatigue and interference of fatigue with the patients’ daily life. To evaluate the monitoring system in an observational study, we recruited seven patients suffering from cancer related fatigue and tracked them over two to three weeks. We collected around  h of activity data and over  completed questionnaires. We analysed the average completion of answering the digital questionnaires and the wearing time of the smartphone. A within-subject analysis of the perceived fatigue, its interference and measured physical activity yielded in patient specific fatigue and activity patterns depending on the time of day. Physical activity level correlated stronger with the interference of fatigue than with the fatigue itself and the variance of the acceleration correlates stronger than absolute activity values. With this work, we provide a monitoring system used for cancer related fatigue. We show with an observational study that the monitoring system is accepted by our study cohort and that it provides additional details about the perceived fatigue and physical activity to a weekly paper-based questionnaire.","doc_id":15121,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"54","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12073","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Shape-based assessment of intracranial aneurysm disease status","authors":"Juchler, Norman; Schilling, Sabine; Vartan, Kurtcuoglu; Hirsch, Sven","subject":"Shape-based risk assessment; Intracranial aneurysms;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"616","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Shape-based assessment of intracranial aneurysm disease status; Shape-based risk assessment; Intracranial aneurysms;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; The risk assessment of intracranial aneurysms is an exceedingly difficult task.

Previous phylogenetic studies have revealed the extreme genetic homogeneity of the pathogenoutside its center of origin, which makes epidemiological studies difficult. These are generally only possible using hypervariable regions of the genome such as those represented by CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), which are, however, not practical to sequence due to their size and variability. Here, we present a simple PCR assay targeting the duplication of a single CRISPR spacer in Erwinia  amylovora that was found to be an important marker to discriminate between two main European populations of the pathogen. We implemented the assay on a total of  isolates to follow the spread of fire blight across the continent over several decades and, wherever possible, within single countries. The results obtained point to the occurrence of two major separate introduction events for E. amylovora in Europe that occurred approximately  years apart, and confirmed the existence of two principal distribution areas located in Northeastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean Basin from which the pathogen moved on to colonize the Eurasian continent.","doc_id":15175,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"44","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21820","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Antiviral screen against canine distemper virus-induced membrane fusion activity","authors":"Shrestha, Neeta; Gall, Flavio; Vesin, Jonathan; Chambon, Marc; Turcatti, Gerardo; Fotiadis, Dimitrios; Riedl, Rainer; Plattet, Philippe","subject":"CDV; Cell-based fusion assay; Envelope glycoproteins; Host cell receptor; Inhibitor discovery;  Mikrobiologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"579","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Antiviral screen against canine distemper virus-induced membrane fusion activity; CDV; Cell-based fusion assay; Envelope glycoproteins; Host cell receptor; Inhibitor discovery;  Mikrobiologie; Canine distemper virus (CDV), a close relative of the human pathogen measles virus (MeV), is an enveloped, negative sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Morbillivirus and causes severe diseases in dogs and other carnivores. Although the vaccination is available as a preventive measure against the disease, the occasional vaccination failure highlights the importance of therapeutic alternatives such as antivirals against CDV. The morbilliviral cell entry system relies on two interacting envelope glycoproteins: the attachment (H) and fusion (F) proteins. Here, to potentially discover novel entry inhibitors targeting CDV H, F and/or the cognate receptor: signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) proteins, we designed a quantitative cell-based fusion assay that matched high-throughput screening (HTS) settings. By screening two libraries of small molecule compounds, we successfully identified two membrane fusion inhibitors (F- and F-). Although both inhibitors exhibited similarities in structure and potency with the small molecule compound G (an AS- class morbilliviral F-protein inhibitor), F- displayed improved efficacy in blocking fusion activity when a G-escape variant was employed. Altogether, we present a cell-based fusion assay that can be utilized not only to discover antiviral agents against CDV but also to dissect the mechanism of morbilliviral-mediated cell-binding and cell-to-cell fusion activity.","doc_id":15314,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9939","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Differences across health care systems in outcome and cost-utility of surgical and conservative treatment of chronic low back pain : a study protocol","authors":"Melloh, Markus; Röder, Christoph; Elfering, Achim; Theis, Jean-Claude; Müller, Urs; Staub, Lukas P.; Aghayev, Emin; Zweig, Thomas; Barz, Thomas; Kohlmann, Thomas; Wieser, Simon; Jüni, Peter; Zwahlen, Marcel","subject":"Chronic disease; Delivery of health care; Health care cost; Human; Low back pain; New Zealand; Outcome assessment; Switzerland; Cross-cultural comparison; Prospective study; Cost-utility; Study protocol;  Orthopädische Chirurgie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"617.5","year":"2008","for_data_analysis":"Differences across health care systems in outcome and cost-utility of surgical and conservative treatment of chronic low back pain : a study protocol; Chronic disease; Delivery of health care; Health care cost; Human; Low back pain; New Zealand; Outcome assessment; Switzerland; Cross-cultural comparison; Prospective study; Cost-utility; Study protocol;  Orthopädische Chirurgie; Background: There is little evidence on differences across health care systems in choice and outcome of the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) with spinal surgery and conservative treatment as the main options. At least six randomised controlled trials comparing these two options have been performed; they show conflicting results without clear-cut evidence for superior effectiveness of any of the evaluated interventions and could not address whether treatment effect varied across patient subgroups. Cost-utility analyses display inconsistent results when comparing surgical and conservative treatment of CLBP. Due to its higher feasibility, we chose to conduct a prospective observational cohort study.Methods: This study aims to examine if: . Differences across health care systems result in different treatment outcomes of surgical and conservative treatment of CLBP. Patient characteristics (work-related, psychological factors, etc.) and co-interventions (physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, return-to-work programs, etc.) modify the Outcome of treatment for CLBP. Cost-utility in terms of quality-adjusted life years differs between surgical and conservative treatment of CLBP.This study will recruit  patients from orthopaedic spine units, rehabilitation centres, and pain clinics in Switzerland and New Zealand. Effectiveness will be measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at baseline and after six months. The change in ODI will be the primary endpoint of this study.

It will classify patients with CLBP into different clinical subgroups and help to identify specific target groups who might benefit from specific surgical or conservative interventions. Furthermore, cost-utility differences will be identified for different groups of patients with CLBP.

At first glance, energy is only required for charging devices. However, energy input is also needed for manufacturing devices and for data transfer. In the interdisciplinary project “digital sufficiency”, the cumulative energy demand (ced) of digital media use by Swiss adolescents was modelled with a life cycle assessment. The project was funded by the Mercator Foundation Switzerland.Modelling approach: Modelling was based on digital media behaviour data. A survey was carried out to gather detailed answers from more than  swiss adolescents aged between  and . These data were adapted to represent the average swiss young person. The results were supplemented with data on device ownership from the JAMES study. Since most adolescents have multiple devices, the survey focused on the use of devices that have multiple uses and are widespread: mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops and televisions.For each type of digital media use (i.e. sending text messages), the following aspects were included: the electricity demand for charging the devices, the electricity and equipment needed for data provision (data centre) and transfer (wlan, mobile antenna, international network). In addition, the pro-rata energy requirement for manufacturing the devices was included. To calculate the energy demand associated with data transfer, an average data volume per behaviour was compiled. Modelling of the internet and the devices was based on the green media calculator. The ced was calculated with the method proposed by Frischknecht et al.. As background data, the Swiss database ecoinvent, version . was used (system model: \"recycled content\" corresp. “cut-off”). Results: The average  to  year old swiss individual’s digital media use has a cumulative energy demand of roughly  megajoules per day. Of this energy, almost % is non-renewable. The analysis showed that the production and disposal of the devices accounts for more than half of the energy. Devices owned by the adolescents themselves as well as those that are shared within the family (pro-rata) were accounted for. More than % of the ced results from televisions, since almost every family (%) and nearly one in three adolescents owns a television. Another reason is that televisions need more energy than smaller devices both for the production (higher material demand) and use phase (direct energy use; larger data transfer due to high image resolution.) The devices direct electricity consumption contributes approx. % to the total ced: desktops and televisions each contribute %, laptops % and the remaining devices less than %. The transfer of data from the device to the data centre and within the internet is of little relevance. The base use of the router (stand-by) accounts for % of the energy demand. Processing and provision of data in data centres is negligible for all activities, except for televisions (%) and video viewing (%).Conclusions: When assessing the cumulative energy demand of digital media use, it is important not only to consider the direct energy use of devices, but also include the indirect energy needed for production of the devices. Data provision in data centres is only relevant for data intense uses. To reduce the energy demand, the following recommendations can be given: () sharing devices and avoiding buying new ones by increasing their lifetime. () switching from energy intensive devices like desktops and televisions to more efficient devices like mobile phones. () reducing the number of new devices purchased has the biggest reduction potential.","doc_id":15380,"prior":"life cycle assessment","SDG12":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19428","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"A review of nature-based solutions for resource recovery in cities","authors":"Kisser, Johannes; Wirth, Maria; De Gusseme, Bart; Van Eekert, Miriam; Zeeman, Grietje; Schönborn, Andreas; Vinnerås, Björn; Finger, David C.; Kolbl Repinc, Sabina; Bulc, Tjaša Griessler; Bani, Aida; Pavlova, Dolja; Staicu, Lucian C.; Atasoy, Merve; Cetecioglu, Zeynep; Kokko, Marika; Haznedaroglu, Berat Z.; Hansen, Joachim; Istenič, Darja; Canga, Eriona; Malamis, Simos; Camilleri-Fenech, Margaret; Beesley, Luke","subject":"Circular Cities; Energy; Nature-Based Solutions; Nutrients; Resource Recovery;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"A review of nature-based solutions for resource recovery in cities; Circular Cities; Energy; Nature-Based Solutions; Nutrients; Resource Recovery;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Our modern cities are resource sinks designed on the current linear economic model which recovers very little of the original input.

The starting point was the so-called FM Value Map developed earlier by the leader of the research group. The project applied three basic theoretical perspectives: FM, Corporate Real Estate Management (CREM) and Business to Business (BB) marketing and started with a major literature review on added value based on each of these perspectives. The collaboration included a series of workshops and preparation of research papers covering theoretical, methodological and empirical aspects. The results were published as an anthology in May . The three basic perspectives of FM, CREM and BB marketing provide both overlapping and complementary focus areas in relation to adding value. Four conceptual models are presented and compared. They include parameters and strategies for how FM can add value with many similarities and a trend towards convergence. Stakeholder relationships and relationship management are seen as crucial in adding value, which for instance is expressed in the concepts FM Value Network and Value Adding Management. Besides adding value for the core business of organisations it is becoming increasingly important for FM to add value for society, for instance in terms of sustainability and corporate social responsibility. The advancement in knowledge and understanding presented in the paper offers a new state of the art, which can give inspiration and guidance for cutting edge FM organisations and professionals as well as for advanced teaching and future research.","doc_id":15881,"prior":"corporate social responsibility","SDG12":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7220","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Asynchronous wake-up scheme for wireless light curtains","authors":"Benoît, David; Almer, Daniel; Würms, Martin; Meli, Marcel; Käser, Hans","subject":"RFID; Wireless; Wake-up; Low power;  Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2008","for_data_analysis":"Asynchronous wake-up scheme for wireless light curtains; RFID; Wireless; Wake-up; Low power;  Informatik; It is desired to wirelessly control light curtains in an industrial environment.

The new Health Insurance Act mandates the introduction of a national tariff system which reflects differences in resource use across patients based on observable patient characteristics. In this study we develop a prospective payment system (PPS).Data: Primary data on patient characteristics, cost per episode and daily time spent by medical staff were collected in a survey of ’ patients from  inpatient psychiatric facilities in , representing roughly one third of the annual total. Patient characteristics include the main psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-) and a weekly assessment of the severity of illness using the Health of Nations Outcome Scales questionnaire (HoNOS).Methods: Predictors of per-diem cost are examined with a multivariate linear regression model. Explanatory variables include the main psychiatric diagnosis, HoNOS scores, socio-demographic characteristics, type of insurance plan, compulsory hospitalization, emergency hospitalization, and hospital fixed effects. Furthermore, a staggered progression of per-diem cost over time is modelled. Different variants of the tariff structure are evaluated, some of which include intentional deviation of the tariff from the true distribution of costs in order to set incentives. Goodness-of-fit is evaluated by an out-of-sample evaluation of several statistical measures of the deviation of hypothetical revenues and observed costs, such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).Results: Compared to the uniform per-diem tariff presently in operation in Switzerland, the PPS are capable of improving the accuracy of the tariff from a MAPE value of .% to approximately .%. The analysis yields several variants of PPS which are equivalent in terms of goodness-of-fit, but differ in terms of the patient characteristics used and with respect to financial incentives for hospitals. The main model constitutes a per-diem payment which is differentiated over three phases of treatment; the first week, days  to , and from the -st day onward. The payment is further determined by  diagnostic groups, scores in three out of the  dimensions of the HoNOS questionnaire (aggression, non-accidental self-injury, somatic comorbidity), and three age-related groups.Discussion: The proposed PPS combines incentives for an appropriate provision of care with incentives for a reduction of length of stay. Policy makers should take into account the different incentives implied by the alternative variants. While the PPS yields a set of adjusting factors for the payment, the Swiss system requires hospital-specific per-diem base rates to be negotiated between the mental health facilities and the insurers.","doc_id":15995,"prior":"Produktion","posterior":"resource use","SDG12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7171","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Low power window detector for ZigBee home automation applications","authors":"Meli, Marcel; Rion, Olivier","subject":"Low power; Wireless communication; Home automation; ZigBee;  Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"004","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Low power window detector for ZigBee home automation applications; Low power; Wireless communication; Home automation; ZigBee;  Informatik; Heating or cooling a room when windows or doors are open is obviously not a good idea.

Sensors that detect the state of doors/windows can help in the automation process, so as to reduce energy losses or remind us to close “that window”.

Methode: Die Perspektiven der Nutzenden und der Health Professionals wurden mittels Fokusgruppeninterviews, einer Online-Befragung und der Befragung einer sogenannten QS-Usergroup erfasst. Ergebnisse: Gesunde, chronisch kranke Nutzende und Health Professionals haben unterschiedliche Motivationen und Einstellungen gegenüber der Selbstvermessung. Gesunde Personen möchten mehr über sich erfahren und konkrete Ziele erreichen, z.B. Reduktion von Gewicht oder sportliche Leistungen. Chronisch kranke Personen nutzen die Selbstvermessung, um ihre Krankheit besser managen zu können und um Zusammenhänge zwischen Verhalten, Alltag und Symptomen zu ergründen. Beide Gruppen zeigen den Wunsch nach mehr Wissen und Eigenverantwortung. Von Health Professionals erwarten sie eine Interpretation und Auseinandersetzung mit den Daten. Health Professionals stehen den Messergebnissen kritisch gegenüber, wenn diese nicht über anerkannte Medizinprodukte erfolgt sind. Die Zuverlässigkeit der Messungen und Informationen sind für Konsumprodukte meist nicht geprüft. Festzustellen, welche dieser Geräte und Anwendungen für die Therapie geeignet sind, kann von den Health Professionals nicht geleistet werden. Fazit: Das Potential für Empowerment und Partizipation von Patientinnen und Patienten durch Quantified Self ist vorhanden, kann aber bislang nur in geringem Umfang realisiert werden.","doc_id":16128,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"59","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6811","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Ökobeichtstuhl - Provoking and Entertaining : Confessions of a ‘Scientainment’ Project","authors":"Jaisli, Isabel; Bättig-Frey, Petra","subject":"Ökobilanz; Scientainment;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Ökobeichtstuhl - Provoking and Entertaining : Confessions of a ‘Scientainment’ Project; Ökobilanz; Scientainment;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","doc_id":16152,"prior":"Ökobilanz","SDG12":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1561","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Fire blight disease reactome : RNA-seq transcriptional profile of apple host plant defence responses to Erwinia amylovora pathogen infection","authors":"Kamber, Tim; Buchmann, Jan P.; Pothier, Joël; Smits, Theo; Wicker, Thomas; Duffy, Brion","subject":"Transcriptomics; Feuerbrand; Erwinia;  Biologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Fire blight disease reactome : RNA-seq transcriptional profile of apple host plant defence responses to Erwinia amylovora pathogen infection; Transcriptomics; Feuerbrand; Erwinia;  Biologie; The molecular basis of resistance and susceptibility of host plants to fire blight, a major disease threat to pome fruit production globally, is largely unknown. RNA-sequencing data from challenged and mock-inoculated flowers were analyzed to assess the susceptible response of apple to the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora. In presence of the pathogen , transcripts were differentially expressed at  h post inoculation. These included putative disease resistance, stress, pathogen related, general metabolic, and phytohormone related genes. Reads, mapped to regions on the apple genome where no genes were assigned, were used to identify potential novel genes and open reading frames. To identify transcripts specifically expressed in response to E. amylovora, RT-PCRs were conducted and compared to the expression patterns of the fire blight biocontrol agent Pantoea vagans strain C-, another apple pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. papulans, and mock inoculated apple flowers. This led to the identification of a peroxidase superfamily gene that was lower expressed in response to E. amylovora suggesting a potential role in the susceptibility response.

The burden of physical inactivity was estimated with a population attributable fractions (PAFs) approach.

It is associated with decreased quality of life for patients, and presents a major burden for caregivers. The involvement of informal caregivers in medical care is recommended, but it has not been clearly described. An understanding of the experience of caregivers is needed to improve the support provided to them by healthcare professionals.Design: A qualitative, interpretative, phenomenological approach was used.Methods: Twelve informal caregivers participated in qualitative interviews. The analysis followed the six steps of the interpretative phenomenological approach.Results: Caregivers' experiences were described using five themes: () feeling overwhelmed by their loved one having unexplainable symptoms and behaviours; () learning that this and previous experiences were complications of liver disease; () becoming aware of the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy; () having feelings of being tied down and () experiencing and overcoming obstacles in working with healthcare professionals.Conclusions: This study provides insight into caregivers' experiences and the consequences for their lives. The first occurrence of symptoms was a shock, but receiving the diagnosis was seen as an important step in understanding and learning. Caregivers provide daily assessments of their relatives' conditions, and they feel responsible for medication management. Over time, the caregivers impressively showed how they were able to incorporate their personal experiences into care-giving and to accept more accountability in managing the disease.Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses should acknowledge caregivers as experts in caring for their loved ones. Nurses can assist caregivers in managing an episode of hepatic encephalopathy and can provide individualised interventions to ease the future burden.","doc_id":16530,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24237","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Connoisseurship consumption & market evolution : the case of the Swiss mechanical watch industry and the emergence of new luxury watch brands","authors":"Pieth, Matthias; Duma, Fabio","subject":"Connoisseurship; Luxury consumer behavior; Luxury market evolution; Luxury marketing; Luxury management;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"658.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Connoisseurship consumption & market evolution : the case of the Swiss mechanical watch industry and the emergence of new luxury watch brands; Connoisseurship; Luxury consumer behavior; Luxury market evolution; Luxury marketing; Luxury management;  Marketingmanagement; The Swiss luxury watch industry is dominated by major brands which, coming out of the quartz crisis in the s, redefined themselves focusing on heritage, tradition and the craftmanship of watchmaking and today are subsidiaries of major luxury groups with the exception of brands such as Rolex, Audemars Piguet or Chopard. However, since the early ’s, several small independent watch brands have emerged in the shadow of the big players and created a lively and diverse niche market. Drawing from institutional theory and literature on connoisseurship consumption and market evolution, the present study set out to define connoisseurship in the watch context, and what effect connoisseurship consumption has on market evolution of the Swiss mechanical watch industry in general and in particular on the emergence of independent brands and their legitimization in the market. To determine and define the characteristics of connoisseurs and the role of connoisseurship consumption in the particular context, and to investigate their role in the emergence of independent watch brands, a qualitative study was conducted by conducting expert interviews with representatives of independent watch companies and watch connoisseurs. The study fills a gap in marketing research on connoisseurship consumption in the Swiss watch industry and contributes to the broader understanding of the role of connoisseurs and connoisseurship consumption for market evolution in comparable segments or product categories. The results show that connoisseurship consumption plays a considerable role in the emergence phase of independent watch brands. The findings suggest that connoisseurship consumption is important for new independent watch brands to gain customers and to build brand legitimacy. Whilst an increasing number of connoisseurs question the value propositions of some bigger and well-known brands (e.g. heritage), it remains yet to be seen if connoisseurship consumption will have an effect on the watch market in general as more consumers accumulate detailed knowledge about the sector and the product category.

Dieser Trend nennt sich «Quantified Self» und ist nicht nur eine Spielerei, sondern der Drang nach Selbstoptimierung. Das Ziel der Quantified Self-Bewegung ist es, neue Erkenntnisse über sich selbst zu gewinnen (Timmer, Kool & van Est, ). Nafus und Sherman () bezeichnen diese Entwicklung als «Self-knowledge through numbers». Die Selbstvermessung knüpft an eine lange Tradition in der Forschung an, bei der es darum geht, Verhalten zu quantifizieren, zu analysieren und zu optimieren (Timmer, Kool & van Est, ). Es stellen sich die Fragen, wie die Selbstvermessungs-Technologien heute genutzt werden, welche Erwartungen damit verbunden sind und welche Beweggründe dahinter stehen. Diese und weitere Fragen wurden im Rahmen einer interdisziplinären Studie untersucht, die von der Stiftung für Technologiefolgen-Abschätzung TA-SWISS initiiert wurde.Methode: Mittels Literaturrecherche und Experten/-innen-Interviews wurde der Ist-Stand und die Trendentwicklung von Quantified Self erarbeitet. In Fokusgruppen wurden Nutzer/-innen und Health Professionals zu Motiven, Motivation und Erfahrungen befragt. Resultate: Durch Selbstvermessungstechnologien wird der Körper zum Ergebnis der eigenen Leistung und ist nicht mehr biologisches Schicksal. Krankheit, Unproduktivität und Unzufriedenheit werden als Verlust von Selbstkontrolle und Selbstdisziplin gedeutet (Lupton, ).

Here, we report that in vitro models of disease comprised of primary striatal neurons expressing N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (via lentiviral gene delivery) faithfully reproduce the gene expression changes seen in human HD. Neither viral infection nor unrelated (enhanced green fluorescent protein) transgene expression had a major effect on resultant RNA profiles. Expression of a wild-type fragment of huntingtin [htt-Q] also caused only a small number of RNA changes. The disease-related signal in htt-Q versus htt-Q comparisons was far greater, resulting in the differential detection of % of all mRNA probe sets. Transcriptomic effects of mutated htt are time- and polyglutamine-length dependent and occur in parallel with other manifestations of polyglutamine toxicity over - weeks. Specific RNA changes in htt-Q-expressing striatal cells accurately recapitulated those observed in human HD caudate and included decreases in PENK (proenkephalin), RGS (regulator of G-protein signaling ), dopamine D() receptor (DRD), DRD, CNR (cannabinoid CB() receptor), and DARPP- (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein-; also known as PPPRB) mRNAs. HD-related transcriptomic changes were also observed in primary neurons expressing a longer fragment of mutant huntingtin (htt-Q). The gene expression changes observed in cultured striatal neurons are not secondary to abnormalities of neuronal firing or glutamatergic, dopaminergic, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling, thereby demonstrating that HD-induced dysregulation of the striatal transcriptome might be attributed to intrinsic effects of mutant huntingtin.","doc_id":16688,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23357","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Automatic quantification of white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging","authors":"Igwe, Kay C.; Lao, Patrick J.; Vorburger, Robert S.; Banerjee, Arit; Rivera, Andres; Chesebro, Anthony; Laing, Krystal; Manly, Jennifer J.; Brickman, Adam M.","subject":"Automated segmentation; Half Gaussian mixture model; Mixture model; Small vessel cerebrovascular disease; White matter hyperintensity;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Automatic quantification of white matter hyperintensities on T-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging; Automated segmentation; Half Gaussian mixture model; Mixture model; Small vessel cerebrovascular disease; White matter hyperintensity;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//; White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are areas of increased signal visualized on T-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. They are typically attributed to small vessel cerebrovascular disease in the context of aging. Among older adults, WMH are associated with risk of cognitive decline and dementia, stroke, and various other health outcomes. There has been increasing interest in incorporating quantitative WMH measurement as outcomes in clinical trials, observational research, and clinical settings. Here, we present a novel, fully automated, unsupervised detection algorithm for WMH segmentation and quantification. The algorithm uses a robust preprocessing pipeline, including brain extraction and a sample-specific mask that incorporates spatial information for automatic false positive reduction, and a half Gaussian mixture model (HGMM). The method was evaluated in  participants with varying degrees of WMH (.-. cm) from a community-based study of aging and dementia with dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, correlation, and bias relative to the ground truth manual segmentation approach performed by two expert raters. Results were compared with those derived from commonly used available WMH segmentation packages, including SPM lesion probability algorithm (LPA), SPM lesion growing algorithm (LGA), and Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (BIANCA). The HGMM algorithm derived WMH values that had a dice score of ., sensitivity of ., and specificity of . compared to ground truth. White matter hyperintensity volumes derived with HGMM were strongly correlated with ground truth values (r = ., p = .e-), with no observable bias (-. [-., .], p-value = .). Our novel algorithm uniquely uses a robust preprocessing pipeline and a half-Gaussian mixture model to segment WMH with high agreement with ground truth for large scale studies of brain aging.","doc_id":16765,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24473","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"How can the international clinical guidelines for knee osteoarthritis management be implemented systematically in Switzerland?","authors":"Ettlin, Lea; Niedermann Schneider, Karin","subject":"Policy Brief; Implementation; Exercise; Guideline; Knee osteoarthritis;  Physiotherapie;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"615.82, 616.7","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"How can the international clinical guidelines for knee osteoarthritis management be implemented systematically in Switzerland?; Policy Brief; Implementation; Exercise; Guideline; Knee osteoarthritis;  Physiotherapie;  Krankheiten des Bewegungsapparates und Orthopädie; Key MessagesThe challenges: International clinical guidelines for the conservative management of knee osteoarthritis (OA) recommend exercise, education, and weight control (if appropriate) as first-line treatment for all people with knee OA. However, findings from various health care settings have identified an underuse of exercise and education. A recent survey among medical specialists in Switzerland identified an evidence-performance gap, implying that the strong evidence in favour of exercise is not being transferred into clinical practice. On average, only % of patients with knee OA were reported to have been referred for specific exercise. The systematic application of structured exercise and education to translate the guideline recommendations into practice would help to overcome this evidence-performance gap in Switzerland.This policy brief summarises the main results from the above-mentioned survey, describes the challenges facing the improvement of conservative disease management (i.e. the systematic application of structured exercise and education) and presents options to address the challenges resulting in three key recommendations.Recommendations: The following describes the three key recommendations for the implementation of the clinicalguideline’s recommendation of ‘exercise and education as first-line treatment’ into practice in Switzerland: Translation of guideline recommendations into a specific exercise and education programme Implementing a best-practice exercise and education programme in Switzerland could be a solution to translate the guideline recommendations into practice. There are existing structured exercise and education programmes for knee OA that are already successfully established throughout the world.Facilitation of the systematic application of exercise through standardised treatment pathwaysThe education of health care professionals is important to increase their understanding of the need, the effectiveness and long-term benefits of exercise, as well as the advantages of a structured treatment pathway. This would facilitate the systematic application of exercise and education through standardised treatment pathways. A standardised treatment pathway could could also facilitate an improvement in interprofessional work collaboration.Promotion of the benefits of exercise in the long-term management of chronic diseases: To achieve a paradigm shift from the current situation of simply treating acute symptoms to structured exercise and education and self-management, it is essential to promote the benefits of exercise. The Swiss population should be informed and made aware of the fact that physical inactivity is a risk factor for knee OA related symptoms and that exercise is a beneficial intervention to prevent or improve these symptoms.Implementation considerations: Potential windows of opportunity:• There is high-quality evidence in favour of exercise reducing pain and improving function in people with knee OA. A Cochrane review from  states that further research in this area is unlikely to change the evidence that exercise is beneficial for knee pain and physical function.• Financial pressure for cost-effective health care management.• Increased awareness of health and cost benefits of exercise for non-comunicable diseases, e.g. knee OA.• Existing exercise and education programmes for people with knee OA established throughout the world.","doc_id":16767,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8725","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Psychometric properties of the Fatigue Severity Scale : Rasch analyses of responses in a Norwegian and a Swedish MS cohort","authors":"Lerdal, A.; Johansson, S.; Kottorp, Anders; von Koch, L.","subject":"Fatigue; Multiple Sclerosis; Psychometrics; Survey and Questionnaire; Severity of Illness Index;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Psychometric properties of the Fatigue Severity Scale : Rasch analyses of responses in a Norwegian and a Swedish MS cohort; Fatigue; Multiple Sclerosis; Psychometrics; Survey and Questionnaire; Severity of Illness Index;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Background: Rigorous testing of the original Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS-) with modern psychometric methods is warranted.Objective: To determine the psychometric properties of the FSS- in multiple sclerosis (MS): internal scale validity; person response validity; unidimensionality; uniform differential item functioning; temporal stability of response patterns; and ability to separate people into distinct groups of fatigue.Methods: Rasch analyses were conducted on data from a Norwegian and a Swedish MS cohort followed for two years.Results: Item estimations in the FSS- did not differ between sex or levels of education but between the cohorts with regard to disability, disease course and time for evaluation, however, items  and  demonstrated unacceptable high outfit mean-square values in both cohorts.

Due to the high burden of the disease, depression is of particular concern. However, knowledge about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Swiss university students during the pandemic is limited. We therefore assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their change during the COVID- pandemic in a large sample of Swiss university students. Methods: We assessed depressive symptoms in two cross-sectional cohorts of university students (n = ) in spring and autumn  during the COVID- pandemic and compared them with a matched sample of the Swiss national population (n = ). Binary logistic regression models estimated prevalence with corresponding % confidence intervals (% CI). Results: Adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in female (.% (% CI: .–.)) and male students (.% (% CI: .–.)) was substantially higher than in the matching female (.% (% CI: .–.)) and male (.% (.–.)) pre-pandemic national population. Depressive symptoms in the two consecutive student cohorts did not significantly differ. Conclusions: More than a quarter of Swiss university students reported depressive symptoms during the COVID- pandemic, which was substantially higher as compared to the matched general population.

Patienten/-innen und Angehörige haben zugleich hohe Ansprüche an die Thematisierung belastender Themen.  Ziel: Bislang gibt es kaum Daten zur Ärzte/-innen-Patienten/-innen-Kommunikation (APK) bei IPF in der Schweiz. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es daher, eine Grundlage für eine bedürfnisgerechte und optimale APK aus Sicht der Patienten/-innen abzuleiten. Methodik: Mittels einer elektronischen Erhebung in der Patienten/-innen Kohorte wurde der IST- und SOLL-Zustand in der APK bei IPF erhoben. Dafür wurden insgesamt  IPF-Patienten/-innen und Angehörige zu ihren Erfahrungen und Bedürfnissen in der APK befragt.Resultate: Zusammengefasst über alle Bereiche zeigt sich, dass fast die Hälfte (%) keine zufriedenstellenden Erfahrungen mit der APK gemacht hat. Für eine gelungene Kommunikation auf Patienten/-innenseite ist laut Befragung die Berücksichtigung der individuellen Bedürfnisse im Gespräch sowie die präzise Aufklärung über die Behandlungsoptionen massgeblich.  Schlussfolgerung: Für Ärzte/-innen ist es wichtig, angemessen auf Ängste, Wünsche und Sorgen zu reagieren und Behandlungsmöglichkeiten transparent zu vermitteln. Diesbezüglich wird empfohlen, das Kommunikationsverhalten in der Praxis zu reflektieren und eine bedürfnisorientierte Kommunikation anzustreben.","doc_id":17444,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"54","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21646","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Cooperative caching and video characteristics in D2D edge networks","authors":"Kafıloğlu, S.

Producing MIEDs requires resources, energy and causes considerable emissions. Extending the service life MIEDs could significantly reduce the demand for new devices and associated environmental impacts. However, whether service life extension actually reduces environmental impacts associated with MIEDs is still uncertain. First, available life cycle assessments of MIEDs suggest that the production of integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for the majority of GHG emissions during the production phase and that greenhouse gas emissions increase with the size of the device and, more importantly, with its storage capacity. However, there is only little information available on MIED specific components such as logic or memory type integrated circuits. In order to quantify environmental impacts of service life extension of MIEDs new approaches for life cycle inventory modelling (e.g. modular modelling) are required. Second, service life-extending measures are subject to rebound effects, which occur if the number of devices being produced does not fall as expected. Such effects depend on consumer behaviour (e.g. re-spending effects) and the rationalities of involved economic actors. Thus, environmental, behavioural and economic aspects have tobe taken into account in order to develop service life extending measures that entail environmental benefits while being both economically viable and appealing to consumers.","doc_id":17690,"prior":"consumer behaviour","SDG12":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8719","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Factors that impact the level of difficulty of everyday technology in a sample of older adults with and without cognitive impairment","authors":"Patomella, Ann-Helen; Kottorp, Anders; Malinowsky, Camilla; Nygård, Louise","subject":"Mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; Occupational therapy;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Factors that impact the level of difficulty of everyday technology in a sample of older adults with and without cognitive impairment; Mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; Occupational therapy;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Everyday technologies (ET) are an important part of the environment in which we live and interact, and older adults with cognitive impairments have to be able to manage ETs in order to participate in society.

This is unfortunate, as the potential for a broader societal impact through claims is significant.There are several best practices for transforming organizations to deliver more value along corporate responsibility criteria, and insurance companies need to make treasure of this experience.

Unruptured IAs are prevalent in -% of the population and are detected ever more frequently due to the increased availability of medical imaging. Albeit the majority of IAs develops asymptomatically, the rare rupture of an IA causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage can have detrimental effects on the patient’s health or even cause the patient’s death. Therefore, clinicians are more often faced with difficult treatment decisions where they must weigh the costs of treatment against the risks of aneurysms to rupture.So far it is not possible to non-invasively determine the condition of the affected vessel wall region. Clinicians are therefore seeking for biomarkers that describe the structural stability of IAs. IA morphology, as seen in angiographic imaging, holds the potential for such a biomarker. Recent pathobiological studies suggest that structural wall instability is reflected in the geometry of the aneurysm lumen.This thesis project investigated the imaging-based morphological assessment of IAs. A first, data-driven approach, was based on a quantitative shape analysis derived on D surface geometries of  aneurysms. The author benchmarked established and novel morphometric parameters in terms of their predictive capacity for the disease status of the aneurysm, with the non-sphericity index and normalized Zernike energies performing best. He observed that shape is a stronger predictor for disease status than aneurysm size alone and confirmed the existing belief that IA morphology is associated with rupture.A second, psychometric approach, addressed the indistinct notion of morphological irregularity used by clinicians to characterize IA shape. Based on rating data from  clinical experts and  laypersons, the perceived irregularity of  aneurysms was quantified and used to identify the morphological constituents of overall irregularity. The author demonstrated that irregularity represents a continuous characteristic, with the risk of rupture increasing as the irregularity increases.Both approaches revealed a pronounced dependency of the shape on the anatomical location of the aneurysm. Combining shape and location substantially improved the accuracy of classification models for the IA rupture status. Other clinical aspects such as patient sex, age, smoking status or a history of blood hypertension did not play a significant role in the experiments.For future work, it is of great importance that the scientific community establishes a reference database to which new datasets can be related.

Hence an understanding of disease mechanisms at the molecular level is of paramount importance for identifying possible intervention points for their control. Whole-transcriptome changes during early disease stages in susceptible plant species are less well-documented than those of resistant ones. This study focuses on the differential transcriptional changes at  hours post inoculation (hpi) in tomato leaflets affected by three pathogens: () Phytophthora infestans, () Botrytis cinerea, and () Oidium neolycopersici. Grey mould (B. cinerea) was the disease that had progressed the most by  hpi, both in terms of visible symptoms as well as differential gene expression. By means of RNA-seq, we identified   differentially expressed tomato genes induced by B. cinerea infection and  by P. infestans infection at  hpi. Additionally, a set of  genes were differentially expressed during all three diseases when compared by a Bayesian approach to their respective mock infections. And Gene expression patterns were found to also depend on the inoculation technique. These findings suggest a specific and distinct transcriptional response in plant leaf tissue in reaction to B. cinerea and P. infestans invasion at  hpi, indicating that plants may recognize the attacking pathogen.","doc_id":18043,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19552","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"DIPEx.ch - Datenbank für Gesundheit und Krankheit : Narrative aus Patientensicht ein Einblick in die Diversität bei MS","authors":"Glässel, Andrea; Spitale, Giovanni; Ott, Joelle; Biller-Andorno, Nikola","subject":" Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"616.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"DIPEx.ch - Datenbank für Gesundheit und Krankheit : Narrative aus Patientensicht ein Einblick in die Diversität bei MS;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","doc_id":18053,"prior":"Krankheit","SDG12":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11459","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The potential of gamification in changing consumer behaviour towards a more sustainable nutrition behaviour","authors":"Berger, Verena; Miesler, Linda; Hari, Jürg J.","subject":"Gamification; Behavioral Change; Nutrition; Sustainable Consumption;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.8","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"The potential of gamification in changing consumer behaviour towards a more sustainable nutrition behaviour; Gamification; Behavioral Change; Nutrition; Sustainable Consumption;  Marketingmanagement; Purpose of the Paper: First, the paper discusses gamification and its impact on consumer behaviour in various areas and clarifies opportunities of the application of game elements in these areas.

A special focus in the clinical field is placed on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), especially on those isolated from the stromal vascular fraction of the adipose tissue. Due to their good clinical efficacy and tolerability, they can be used for allogeneic cell therapies (e.g. Crohn’s disease, graft versus host disease, acute myocardial infarct). However, the required number of therapeutically active human adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (hASCs) for allogeneic applications is in the range of trillion cells per year. Thus, alternatives to the -dimensional planar cultivation systems, typically applied to propagate hASCs are urgently required. Different studies have recently demonstrated the applicability of stirred single-use bioreactors as a promising alternative to the planar cultivation systems. In these dynamically mixed culture systems, the required growth surface for the adherent growing cells is provided by microcarriers (MCs), which are suspended in the bioreactor. Although adherent mammalian cells are well investigated in combination with MCs for the production of vaccines, working with hASCs is more complex due to their higher shear sensitivity. This raises the question of how the induced fluid shear stress affects the cell expansion, the cell quality and the formation of MC-cell agglomerates during the cultivation in dynamic bioreactors. For this purpose, MC-based cell expansions were performed in single-use spinner flasks at different impeller speeds below (,  rpm) and above ( and  rpm) the specific suspension criteria NSu ( rpm) and NS ( rpm) for polystyrene-based MCs. Cell numbers, metabolites and the formation of MC-cell agglomerates were measured during the cell expansion process. Furthermore, the expression of standard surface markers (CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD) for hASCs were analysed after harvesting of the cells. Beside the biological investigations, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations were performed in order to predict the velocity gradients and the hydrodynamic forces. The results indicated that too low ( rpm) and too high impeller speeds ( rpm) result in statistically significant lower cell densities (. and . x  cells/mL) compared to those at the suspension criteria (. and . x  cells/mL). These lower cell densities can be ascribed to mass transport limitations at low impeller speeds and to too high hydrodynamic strains at high impeller speeds. The effect of the shear stress on the MC-cell agglomerate formation at high impeller speeds was not significant, when compared the Sauter mean diameters to those resulting at the suspension criteria. In contrast, impeller speeds below the suspension criteria resulted in a strong MC-agglomerate formation, which may support mass transfer limitations.","doc_id":18126,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"41","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21521","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Genetic characterization of Erwinia amylovora isolates detected in the wild walnut‑fruit forest of South Kyrgyzstan","authors":"Doolotkeldieva, Tinatin; Bobushova, Saikal; Carnal, Simon; Rezzonico, Fabio","subject":"Malus sieversii; Malus niedzwetzkyana; Crataegus turkestanica; Pyrus korshinskyi; IUCN red list;  Biochemie;  Pflanzenkrankheiten, Schädlinge","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 632","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Genetic characterization of Erwinia amylovora isolates detected in the wild walnut‑fruit forest of South Kyrgyzstan; Malus sieversii; Malus niedzwetzkyana; Crataegus turkestanica; Pyrus korshinskyi; IUCN red list;  Biochemie;  Pflanzenkrankheiten, Schädlinge; Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight, was first reported in Kyrgyz orchards in  and, within a few years, the disease has spread throughout most of the northern part of the country.

Here, we present the results of field surveys in the forests and in the nearby orchards and gardens of the Jalal-Abad region during the  season. Further, we use genetic profiling of the CRISPR regions to compare the genotypes of the obtained isolates to those of previous outbreaks in the north of the country and in nearby Kazakhstan. While fire blight was found in twelve of the twenty-six sites investigated in and around the Arslonbob walnut–fruit forest, it was mostly located on domesticated varieties of quince, apple or pear in gardens, orchards or nurseries. Plants in the forest and especially endangered wild species were not affected by the disease, but their proximity to the current infection herds is cause of major concern and calls for immediate protective action. Genetic analysis suggests that the main introduction route for fire blight to Central Asia was import of contaminated plant material from already affected countries in the Eurasian continent, which probably occurred on multiple independent instances. Nonetheless, indications of natural spread of the disease were identified between the regions of South Kazakhstan and North Kyrgyzstan.","doc_id":18214,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15360","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Das Blackcurrant Reversion Virus bei Cassis (Ribes nigrum) in der Beerensammlung von ProSpecieRara (Riehen BS) : Virusfreimachung","authors":"Genucchi, Katharina","subject":"Ribes nigrum; Schwarze Johannisbeere; Cassis; Blackcurrant Reversion Virus; Cecidophyopsis ribis; Johannisbeergallmilbe; ProSpecieRara; Virusfreimachung; Thermotherapie; In-vitro-Kultivierung; Blackcurrant; Blackcurrant gall mite; Big bud mite; Virus elimination; Thermotherapy; In vitro cultivation;  Landwirtschaft;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"630, 634","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Das Blackcurrant Reversion Virus bei Cassis (Ribes nigrum) in der Beerensammlung von ProSpecieRara (Riehen BS) : Virusfreimachung; Ribes nigrum; Schwarze Johannisbeere; Cassis; Blackcurrant Reversion Virus; Cecidophyopsis ribis; Johannisbeergallmilbe; ProSpecieRara; Virusfreimachung; Thermotherapie; In-vitro-Kultivierung; Blackcurrant; Blackcurrant gall mite; Big bud mite; Virus elimination; Thermotherapy; In vitro cultivation;  Landwirtschaft;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft; In this bachelor thesis, black currants (Ribes nigrum L.) from the introductory collection of ProSpecieRara (PSR) were examined for the Blackcurrant Reversion Virus (BRV) and a method for virus elimination in the infected plants was searched.

By contrast, its sister species, Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii is the host-specific causative agent of the devastating maize disease Stewart's wilt. This pathogen has a restricted lifecycle, overwintering in an insect vector before being introduced into susceptible maize cultivars, causing disease and returning to overwinter in its vector. The other subspecies of P. stewartii subsp. indologenes, has been isolated from different plant hosts and is predicted to proliferate in different environmental niches. Here we have, by the use of comparative genomics and a comprehensive suite of bioinformatic tools, analyzed the genomes of ten P. stewartii and nineteen P. ananatis strains. Our phylogenomic analyses have revealed that there are two distinct clades within P. ananatis while far less phylogenetic diversity was observed among the P. stewartii subspecies. Pan-genome analyses revealed a large core genome comprising of , protein coding sequences is shared among the twenty-nine compared strains.

These risks change dynamically over time and so, potentially, does their management. Societies and key actors go through learning processes and subsequently may be better able to deal with related challenges. However, social scientific research on the acceptance of such projects is mainly concerned with (static) risk perception issues and does not include dynamic aspects. Adaptive capacity, which is part of the concept of vulnerability, therefore represents a promising complementing facet for this line of research. The aim of this paper is to examine the role of perceived adaptive capacity for the acceptance of contested long-term infrastructure for the two issues of nuclear and hazardous waste. In an online experimental survey (N = ) examining either the acceptance of a nuclear waste repository or of a hazardous waste site we demonstrate that i) perceived adaptive capacity can be separated empirically as a psychological construct from risk and benefit perception, and ii) perceived adaptive capacity explains a significant additional share of variance in the acceptance of both waste types beyond risk and benefit perception. Furthermore, we report what adaptation mechanisms of perceived adaptive capacity participants expect to occur in the future.

On the other hand, there are apple scab, caused by Venturia inaequalis and powdery mildew, caused by Podosphaera leucotricha, which represent the major phytosanitary problems. Classical breeding has produced many scab and mildew resistant cultivars and efforts to breed also fire blight resistant cultivars are currently undertaken. Marker assisted selection (MAS) increases efficiency by allowing early non-destructive screening of seedlings and identifying genotypes showing pyramids of resistance genes. If the development of markers for MAS was the primary goal of genetic analysis in the s, identification and cloning of resistance genes is now the goal. The first and until now the sole resistance gene which has been isolated and transformed into a susceptible apple cultivar is the gene HcrVf (Rvi), responsible for the Vf scab resistance present in most classically bred scab resistant cultivars. Much effort is currently spent in the identification and positional cloning of other apple genes conferring resistance to apple scab and fire blight. In our labs, we identified the putative scab resistance gene Rvi and two fire blight resistance genes namely from ‘Evereste’ and Malus × robusta . The functionality of these candidate genes is currently under scrutiny by complementation experiments. However, the final goal is the creation of a product, e.g., an improved apple cultivar that is resistant to scab and fire blight. The ideal product would have advantages to the environment and producer, and should raise as little concern as possible with consumers. To accomplish this ‘ideal product’, we opted for the cisgenic approach by introducing the scab resistance gene HcrVf with its own regulatory sequences into the highly susceptible apple cultivar, ‘Gala’, through Agrobacterium transformation. All marker genes were eliminated after transformation. Similarly, we are currently introducing into both the readily developed cisgenic ‘Gala’ and in the untransformed ‘Gala’ the putative Malus own fire blight resistance gene candidates, aiming at both proof of functionality of the identified candidates and possibly at rapid development of a fire blight and scab resistant cisgenic apple.","doc_id":18524,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4299","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Umsorgt werden und umsorgen - Leben mit mehreren Langzeiterkrankungen (Leila) : eine qualitative Studie zum Beitrag von APN in integrierter Versorgung","authors":"Müller-Staub, Maria; Zigan, Nicole; Händler-Schuster, Daniela; Probst, Sebastian; Monego, Renate; Imhof, Lorenz","subject":"Advanced Practice Nursing (APN); Leben mit chronischen Krankheiten; Multiple chronische Krankheiten; Integrierte Versorgung; Grounded theory;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Umsorgt werden und umsorgen - Leben mit mehreren Langzeiterkrankungen (Leila) : eine qualitative Studie zum Beitrag von APN in integrierter Versorgung; Advanced Practice Nursing (APN); Leben mit chronischen Krankheiten; Multiple chronische Krankheiten; Integrierte Versorgung; Grounded theory;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Hintergrund: Das Leben mit mehreren chronischen Krankheiten ist komplex und führt zu einer erhöhten Pflege- und Betreuungsbedürftigkeit. Zur Förderung der integrierten Versorgung wurde ein dreijähriges Projekt namens «Leben mit Langzeiterkrankung» (Leila) initiiert. Ziel: Das Projekt hatte zum Ziel, Leistungen von Pflegeexpertinnen in Advanced Practice Nursing (APN) für chronisch erkrankte Menschen in Zusammenarbeit mit Hausarztpraxen zu entwickeln. Folgende Fragestellungen wurden untersucht: . Wie erleben Patient(inn)en, Zuweisende und Pflegeexpertinnen APN das Leila-Dienstleistungsangebot? . Wie gestalten sich Zuweisungsprozesse? . Wie erleben die Beteiligten die Zusammenarbeit und die APN-Rollenausübung? Methode: Es wurde ein qualitativer Ansatz gemäß Grounded Theory nach Corbin und Strauss gewählt, um Erfahrungen mit Leila und Interaktionen der an Leila beteiligten Personen zu untersuchen. Dabei wurden  Interviews mit Patient(inn)en, die mit multiplen chronischen Krankheiten leben, deren betreuende Pflegeexpertinnen APN und zuweisenden Ärzt(inn)en durchgeführt und evaluiert. Ergebnisse: «Umsorgt werden und umsorgen» zeigte sich als zentrale Kategorie. Diese beschreibt wie auf die Patient(inn)en eingegangen wurde, sie einbezogen und ernst genommen wurden. Die Hauptkategorie «Den Alltag gestalten» zeigt, dass die Patient(inn)en lernten, mit den Folgen chronischer Erkrankungen im Alltag umzugehen. «Alle Ressourcen nutzen» legt dar, wie Potenziale und Stärken eingesetzt wurden.

To foster integrated care a project called “Living with chronic disease” (Leila) was initiated. Aim: The aim was to develop an Advanced Practice Nursing (APN) service in collaboration with medical centers for persons who are living with multiple chronic diseases. The following research questions were addressed: . What are patients' experiences, referring physicians and APNs with the Leila-Service? . How are referral processes performed? . How do the involved groups experience collaboration and APN role development? Methods: A qualitative approach according grounded theory of Corbin and Strauss was used to explore the experiences with the Leila project and the interaction of the persons involved.  interviews were conducted with patients who are living with multiple chronic diseases, their APN's and the referring physicians. Results: The findings revealed “Being cared for and caring” as main category. The data demonstrated how patients responded to their involvement into care and that they were taken as serious partners in the care process. The category “organizing everyday life” describes how patients learned to cope with the consequences of living with multiple chronic diseases. “Using all resources” as another category demonstrates how capabilities and strengths were adopted. Conclusions: The results of the cooperation- and allocation processes showed that the APN recognition and APN role performance have to be negotiated. Prospective APN-services for this patient population should be integrated along with physician networks and other service providers including community health nursing.","doc_id":18616,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18667","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Identification of clinically relevant characteristics of intracranial aneurysm morphology","authors":"Juchler, Norman; Schilling, Sabine; Bijlenga, Philippe; Rüfenacht, Daniel; Kurtcuoglu, Vartan; Hirsch, Sven","subject":"Intracranial aneurysms; Morphology;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"616.8","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Identification of clinically relevant characteristics of intracranial aneurysm morphology; Intracranial aneurysms; Morphology;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Intracranial aneurysms are focal deformations of larger cerebral arteries that occur in -% of the population. Although they remain quiescent most of the time, aneurysms may rupture at a rate of about % per year, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage with potentially catastrophic effects on the patient. It is exceedingly challenging to predict the clinical fate of intracranial aneurysms. Currently, physicians associate shape irregularity with vessel wall instability. However, there is no consensus on which shape features reliably predict aneurysm rupture.Here we present two approaches that aim to eliminate the subjectivity of rater assessment. In a first approach, we have implemented a semi-automated classification pipeline to predict the rupture status using morphometric parameters. These parameters were computed from D geometries of intracranial aneurysms obtained from D rotational angiographies. The main objective of this first study was to identify morphometric parameters that efficiently encode the disease status and understand how well morphology predicts disease status in general. In the second study, we followed a psychometric approach to better understand how human raters assess aneurysm morphology. We acquired rating data from  clinical experts and informed laypersons on perceived irregularity and the presence of  different morphological attributes (presence of a rough surface, of blebs, lobules, asymmetry and a complex parent vasculature). We related this data to clinically relevant parameters using regression analysis and binary classification.Our investigations confirmed that aneurysm morphology provides significant information about the disease. For example, a logistic regression model based on perceived irregularity alone is able to discriminate relatively well ruptured from unruptured aneurysms (AUC=.±.). Extending that model by aneurysm location increased the AUC significantly to .±., suggesting that morphology varies with location. Morphometric parameters well correlating to perceived irregularity (e.g. non-sphericity NSI, or total Gaussian curvature GLN) likewise predict the disease status well, but to a lesser extent. More specific parameters are required that are able to encode relevant morphological structure such as blebs/lobules or asymmetry.","doc_id":18626,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1640","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Comparative genomics-informed design of two LAMP detection assays for detection of the kiwifruit pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae and discrimination of isolates belonging to the pandemic biovar 3","authors":"Ruinelli, Michela; Schneeberger, Pierre H.H; Ferrante, Patrizia; Bühlmann, Andreas; Scortichini, Marco; Vanneste, Joel L.; Duffy, Brion; Pothier, Joël F.","subject":"Field based detection; Actinidiae;  Biologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Comparative genomics-informed design of two LAMP detection assays for detection of the kiwifruit pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae and discrimination of isolates belonging to the pandemic biovar ; Field based detection; Actinidiae;  Biologie; The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, sensitive and reliable field-based assay for detection of the quarantine pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, the causal agent of the most destructive and economically important bacterial disease of kiwifruit.

The results of these experiments demonstrated the ability of a single gene isolated from the native gene pool of apple to protect a susceptible cultivar from fire blight.

The new Health Insurance Act mandates the introduction of a national tariff system which reflects differences in resource use across patients based on observable patient characteristics. In this study we develop a prospective payment system (PPS).Data: Primary data on patient characteristics, cost per episode and daily time spent by medical staff were collected in a survey of ’ patients from  inpatient psychiatric facilities in , representing roughly one third of the annual total. Patient characteristics include the main psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-) and a weekly assessment of the severity of illness using the Health of Nations Outcome Scales questionnaire (HoNOS).Methods: Predictors of per-diem cost are examined with a multivariate linear regression model. Explanatory variables include the main psychiatric diagnosis, HoNOS scores, socio-demographic characteristics, type of insurance plan, compulsory hospitalization, emergency hospitalization, and hospital fixed effects. Furthermore, a staggered progression of per-diem cost over time is modelled. Different variants of the tariff structure are evaluated, some of which include intentional deviation of the tariff from the true distribution of costs in order to set incentives. Goodness-of-fit is evaluated by an out-of-sample evaluation of several statistical measures of the deviation of hypothetical revenues and observed costs, such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).Results: Compared to the uniform per-diem tariff presently in operation in Switzerland, the PPS are capable of improving the accuracy of the tariff from a MAPE value of .% to approximately .%. The analysis yields several variants of PPS which are equivalent in terms of goodness-of-fit, but differ in terms of the patient characteristics used and with respect to financial incentives for hospitals. The main model constitutes a per-diem payment which is differentiated over three phases of treatment; the first week, days  to , and from the -st day onward. The payment is further determined by  diagnostic groups, scores in three out of the  dimensions of the HoNOS questionnaire (aggression, non-accidental self-injury, somatic comorbidity), and three age-related groups.Discussion: The proposed PPS combines incentives for an appropriate provision of care with incentives for a reduction of length of stay. Policy makers should take into account the different incentives implied by the alternative variants. While the PPS yields a set of adjusting factors for the payment, the Swiss system requires hospital-specific per-diem base rates to be negotiated between the mental health facilities and the insurers.","doc_id":18829,"prior":"Produktion","posterior":"resource use","SDG12":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6990","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Genome-based population structure analysis of the strawberry plant pathogen Xanthomonas fragariae reveals two distinct groups that evolved independently before its species description","authors":"Gétaz, Michael; Krijger, Marjon; Rezzonico, Fabio; Smits, Theo; van der Wolf, Jan M.; Pothier, Joël F.","subject":" Biochemie;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572, 634","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Genome-based population structure analysis of the strawberry plant pathogen Xanthomonas fragariae reveals two distinct groups that evolved independently before its species description;  Biochemie;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft; Xanthomonas fragariae is a quarantine organism in Europe, causing angular leaf spots on strawberry plants.

The Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ) has proven to be able to separate these groups and might also have potential to predict overall functional level (need of assistance in daily life activities) among them.Aim: To investigate whether the ETUQ can predict overall functional level among older adults with MCI or mild‐stage AD.Method: Participants were older adults with a mean age of  years with MCI (n = ) or mild‐stage AD (n = ). A three‐step scale indicating (i) independence, (ii) need for minimal assistance or (iii) need for moderate to maximal assistance in daily life was dichotomised in two ways and used as outcome variables in two logistic regression models. Predictors in both models were perceived ability to use everyday technology (ET) and amount of relevant everyday technologies measured by the ETUQ. Ethical approval was obtained from the regional Ethical Committee.Result: Perceived ability to use ET discriminated individuals who were independent or in need of minimal support from those in need of moderate to maximal assistance (OR = ., p < ., confidence interval = %; .–.). The amount of relevant everyday technologies discriminated individuals who were independent from those in need of assistance at any level (OR = .; p < .; confidence interval = %; .-.).Conclusion: Both perceived ability to use ET and amount of relevant everyday technologies had potential to predict overall function but at different levels. The findings support the predictive validity of the ETUQ and suggest further research for the development of clinical cut‐off criteria.","doc_id":19159,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"60","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12255","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Engineering of bacteriophages Y2::dpoL1-C and Y2::luxAB for efficient control and rapid detection of the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora","authors":"Born, Yannick; Fieseler, Lars; Thöny, Valentin; Leimer, Nadja; Duffy, Brion; Loessner, Martin J.","subject":"Bacteriophage; Depolymerase; Fire blight; Luciferase; Recombinant phage; Reporter; Reporter phage; Bacteriophages; Erwinia amylovora; Viral gene expression regulation; Genetic engineering; Malus; Plant diseases; Viral proteins; Virulence;  Biologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Engineering of bacteriophages Y::dpoL-C and Y::luxAB for efficient control and rapid detection of the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora; Bacteriophage; Depolymerase; Fire blight; Luciferase; Recombinant phage; Reporter; Reporter phage; Bacteriophages; Erwinia amylovora; Viral gene expression regulation; Genetic engineering; Malus; Plant diseases; Viral proteins; Virulence;  Biologie; Erwinia amylovora is the causative agent of fire blight, a devastating plant disease affecting members of the Rosaceae Alternatives to antibiotics for control of fire blight symptoms and outbreaks are highly desirable, due to increasing drug resistance and tight regulatory restrictions. Moreover, the available diagnostic methods either lack sensitivity, lack speed, or are unable to discriminate between live and dead bacteria. Owing to their extreme biological specificity, bacteriophages are promising alternatives for both aims. In this study, the virulent broad-host-range E. amylovora virus Y was engineered to enhance its killing activity and for use as a luciferase reporter phage, respectively. Toward these aims, a depolymerase gene of E. amylovora virus L (dpoL-C) or a bacterial luxAB fusion was introduced into the genome of Y by homologous recombination. The genes were placed downstream of the major capsid protein orf, under the control of the native promoter. The modifications did not affect viability of infectivity of the recombinant viruses. Phage Y::dpoL-C demonstrated synergistic activity between the depolymerase degrading the exopolysaccharide capsule and phage infection, which greatly enhanced bacterial killing. It also significantly reduced the ability of E. amylovora to colonize the surface of detached flowers. The reporter phage Y::luxAB transduced bacterial luciferase into host cells and induced synthesis of large amounts of a LuxAB luciferase fusion. After the addition of aldehyde substrate, bioluminescence could be readily monitored, and this enabled rapid and specific detection of low numbers of viable bacteria, without enrichment, both in vitro and in plant material.IMPORTANCE: Fire blight, caused by Erwinia amylovora, is the major threat to global pome fruit production, with high economic losses every year. Bacteriophages represent promising alternatives to not only control the disease, but also for rapid diagnostics. To enhance biocontrol efficacy, we combined the desired properties of two phages, Y (broad host range) and L (depolymerase for capsule degradation) in a single recombinant phage. This phage showed enhanced biocontrol and could reduce E. amylovora on flowers. Phage Y was also genetically engineered into a luciferase reporter phage, which transduces bacterial bioluminescence into infected cells and allows detection of low numbers of viable target bacteria. The combination of speed, sensitivity, and specificity is superior to previously used diagnostic methods. In conclusion, genetic engineering could improve the properties of phage Y toward better killing efficacy and sensitive detection of E. amylovora cells.","doc_id":19192,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22876","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Sustainable food production with biostimulants : testing the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus R. irregulare and the bacteria B. amyloliquefaciens on plant growth and disease resistance","authors":"Fehr, Anne-Miamed","subject":"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus; AMF; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Biostimulants; MHB; Rhizoglomus irregulare;  Mikrobiologie;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"579, 635","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Sustainable food production with biostimulants : testing the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus R. irregulare and the bacteria B. amyloliquefaciens on plant growth and disease resistance; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus; AMF; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Biostimulants; MHB; Rhizoglomus irregulare;  Mikrobiologie;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau); The soil beneath our feet holds a complex network of microorganisms that influence each other as well as the plants that grow in the soil. Promoting these soil communities offers new opportunities to create sustainable agricultural systems. Through their fungal network arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) provide additional nutrients from the soil to plants. Hence, they represent a natural soil nutrient resource with the potential to reduce external fertilizer inputs in the future. The AMF Rhizoglomus irregulare and the bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are two biostimulants that associate with roots of many important agricultural crops.In this study three field trials were carried out with the crops celery, celery root and root parsley, on three vegetable farms with organic and demeter management. The effect of the two biostimulants R. irregulare and B. amyloliquefaciens inoculated alone or in combination, on yield performance and disease suppression was evaluated by measuring the plant weight, colonization rate by the inoculated fungus in plant roots, plant nutrient concentrations and disease infection rates.A positive effect of the inoculation with R. irregulare on plant growth was found in root parsley with a significant yield increase of  %. In celery and root parsley both inoculated and control plants showed high colonization levels, indicating that in these soils the occurrence of native AMF was already high. The crop celery root showed a significant increase in arbuscular root colonization. No significant positive effects of B. amyloliquefaciens on plant growth, as well as of both biostimulants on disease suppression were found.The yield increase by R. irregulare inoculation in root parsley was not reflected in a higher colonization rate by AMF in the roots. However, analysis of the nutrient concentrations of the experimental plants shows, that inoculated plants presented significantly higher uptakes of N, P, C, Mg and Ca. It is assumed that the inoculated AM-fungus has replaced the native AM-fungi in the root. In the future, molecular methods present promising tools to investigate the arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonization at species level and therefore, to better understand the influence of inoculated AM- fungi.","doc_id":19245,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"41","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8233","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Big Data : machine learning to identify shape biomarkers in intracranial aneurysm","authors":"Hirsch, Sven; Juchler, Norman; Schilling, Sabine; Bijlenga, Philippe; Rüfenacht, Daniel","subject":" Spezielle Computerverfahren;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"006, 616","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Big Data : machine learning to identify shape biomarkers in intracranial aneurysm;  Spezielle Computerverfahren;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; An intracranial aneurysm is a disease of the cerebral blood vessel wall resulting in the deformation and enlargement of the vascular lumen. If the process of deformation remains active, the vessel wall may either rupture and produce a hemorrhage, or thrombosis and ischemia may occur.Although statistically safe, some IAs do rupture. The physician needs to decide what to do for the individual patient. Obviously, an aneurysm should only be treated if the treatment is less risky than the aneurysm itself. So far, no accepted criteria exist for individual assessment of aneurysm stability and there are no clear treatment guidelines. Consequently, there is currently no validated tool to help predict development or treatment outcomes for an individual aneurysm and physicians rely solely on their personal judgment.The AneuX consortium collects a comprehensive number of patient data sets to estimate the disease status of intracranial aneurysms. The starting point is the hypothesis that vessel D-shape can be used as an image biomarker. Research and development in the field require massive information integration realized by a diverse community of scientists, physicians and engineers involved in better understanding the biological processes, and the development of new tools to manage and treat patients.The available cases are collected in a unified database containing imaging and clinical patient information on intracranial aneurysms. The AneurysmDataBase hosted by the Swiss Neuro Foundation aspires to establish the standard for collecting and characterizing information about intracranial aneurysms. We develop web-based applications to inspect, analyze and display data for various users: clinicians, patients and industry.As an aneurysm’s D-shape is strongly linked to the underlying formation processes, it is believed that the presence or absence of certain shape features mirror the disease status of the aneurysm wall. The shape of the aneurysm and its circumjacent arterial lumen already plays a significant role in the qualitative assessment of the aneurysm. Currently, clinicians associate irregularity with wall instability. However, no consensus yet exists about which shape features reliably predict instability or whether there exist any that qualify as biomarkers of the disease status at all. Here we present a classification pipeline that allows us to identify shape features with the highest predictive power of aneurysm instability.D models of aneurysms are extracted from medical imaging data (mostly D rotational angiography) using a standardized vessel segmentation protocol. Subsequently, the aneurysm and adjacent segments of parent vessels are cut from the lumen replica of the vascular tree. A variety of established representations of the D shape are calculated for the extracted aneurysm segment. These include the calculation of Zernike moments (ZM), their invariants (ZMI) and simple geometry indices such as undulation, ellipticity or non-sphericity. Different feature reduction techniques (for ZMI) and machine-learning classification methods are applied to find linking patterns between shape features and aneurysm disease status.We will present a machine learning framework to identify imaging biomarkers for intracranial aneurysm. These biomarkers are used for assessing the stability of an aneurysm and finally weighed against an interventional risk to propose the best treatment strategy for a patient.The AneurysmDataBase is pivotal to realize studies on larger cohorts and we are presenting the current state and vision of this disease management platform. The database provides statistical knowledge about a lesion site and can e.g. serve design of new devices, by providing geometries for sizing of a device or for conducting Computational Fluid Dynamics.","doc_id":19269,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"59","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8465","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the Danish version of the everyday technology use questionnaire","authors":"Kaptain, Rina Juel; Kottorp, Anders; Patomella, Ann-Helen; Helle, Tina","subject":"Agreement; Svensson’s method; Everyday technology; Occupational therapy; Psychometrics; Translation;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362, 616","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the Danish version of the everyday technology use questionnaire; Agreement; Svensson’s method; Everyday technology; Occupational therapy; Psychometrics; Translation;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Background: Everyday technologies are naturally integrated in people’s daily life.

Nurses in this study report that they can trigger positive reactions and reduce behavioral symptoms by means of meaningful interventions, when connected to the residents’ biography. Meaningful interventions can support residents in making contact to their current everyday life, acting independently and perceiving self-efficacy (= connecting). To initiate meaningful interventions, nurses need to connect biographical information to current experiences of the resident (= negotiating). This requires a thorough understanding of the residents’ situation. Nurses obtain an in-depth understanding through caring relationships, which are characterized by continuity of care and a mutual dialogue, where needs and experiences are shared, understood and evaluated (= being-in-good-hands).Einleitung: In der Schweiz sind % der Pflegeheimbewohnenden von einer dementiellen Erkrankung betroffen. Bei fortschreitender Demenz treten vermehrt Verhaltensauffälligkeiten auf. Dies beeinträchtigt die Lebensqualität von Betroffenen und belastet Angehörige und Pflegende. Ein personzentrierter Ansatz, der die Biographie der Bewohnenden berücksichtigt, reduziert solche Verhaltensauffälligkeiten. In der bestehenden Literatur wird vorwiegend beschrieben, wie biographische Informationen bei punktuellen Therapien und von den ausführenden therapeutischen Fachpersonen einbezogen werden. Personzentrierte Pflege findet jedoch nicht nur während bestimmter Aktivitäten statt: Pflegepersonen sind rund um die Uhr für die Betreuung der Betroffenen zuständig. Ziel: Das Ziel dieser Studie ist es, zu untersuchen, wie Pflegende biographische Informationen im Pflegealltag berücksichtigen. Methode: Es wurden qualitative Interviews mit Pflegefachpersonen (n=) geführt und anhand des Grounded-Theory-Ansatzes nach Charmaz analysiert. Ergebnisse: Das Einbeziehen der Biographie in den Alltag zeigt sich als kontinuierlicher, sich wiederholender Prozess mit drei Hauptkategorien: „Aushandeln“, „Anknüpfen“ und „Aufgehoben sein“. Pflegende dieser Studie berichten, dass positive Reaktionen hervorgerufen und Verhaltensauffälligkeiten reduziert werden können. Voraussetzung dazu sind pflegerische Interventionen, die für die Betroffenen eine spezielle, an ihre Biographie anknüpfende Bedeutung in sich tragen. Sie werden damit für die Betroffenen bedeutungsvoll. Bedeutungsvolle Interventionen erlauben es den Bewohnenden, an den Alltag anzuknüpfen, eigenständig zu handeln und sich als wirksam zu erleben (=Anknüpfen). Um bedeutungsvolle Interventionen zu gestalten, werden biographische Informationen mit aktuellen Erfahrungen verbunden (=Aushandeln). Dazu sind vertiefte Kenntnisse über die Bewohnenden nötig. Diese erhalten Pflegende durch vertrauensvolle Beziehungen, welche sich durch Kontinuität und einen Austausch auszeichnen, bei dem Bedürfnisse und Erfahrungen erfasst, verstanden und gemeinsam eingeschätzt werden (=Aufgehoben sein).","doc_id":19852,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"7","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5196","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Autarkic system for condition monitoring of industrial drives","authors":"Gruber, Juan-Mario","subject":"Condition Monitoring; Energy Harvesting; Wireless Sensor; Zigbee;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004, 621.3","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Autarkic system for condition monitoring of industrial drives; Condition Monitoring; Energy Harvesting; Wireless Sensor; Zigbee;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; A concept for an autonomous condition monitoring is developed.

Infections by Xanthomonas spp. cause a wide variety of non-specific symptoms, making their identification difficult. The coexistence of phylogenetically close strains, but drastically different in their phenotype, poses an added challenge to diagnosis. Data on future climate change scenarios predict an increase in the severity of epidemics and a geographical expansion of pathogens, increasing pressure on plant health services. In this context, the effectiveness of integrated disease management strategies strongly depends on the availability of rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic methods. The accumulation of genomic information in recent years has facilitated the identification of new DNA markers, a cornerstone for the development of more sensitive and specific methods. Nevertheless, the challenges that the taxonomic complexity of this genus represents in terms of diagnosis together with the fact that within the same bacterial species, groups of strains may interact with distinct host species demonstrate that there is still a long way to go. In this review, we describe and discuss the current molecular-based methods for the diagnosis and detection of regulated Xanthomonas, taxonomic and diversity studies in Xanthomonas and genomic approaches for molecular diagnosis.","doc_id":20287,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"50","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1277","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Präeklampsie - eine Krankheit mit psychischen Folgen?","authors":"Debrunner, Eveline","subject":"Präeklampsie; Psychische Auswirkung; Gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität; Posttraumatische Belastungsstörung; Postpartale Depression;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"618","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Präeklampsie - eine Krankheit mit psychischen Folgen?; Präeklampsie; Psychische Auswirkung; Gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität; Posttraumatische Belastungsstörung; Postpartale Depression;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Die Präeklampsie ist eine schwerwiegende Krankheit, die mit möglicherweise ernsten Folgen für Mutter und Kind einhergeht.

The interest in self-quantification and -optimization has strongly increased during the past few years and got an additional boost during the Corona Crisis. This trend is called «The Quantified-Self» and it is practiced not only for fun and out of curiosity, but for many it is out of an urge to improve one’s health. However, little is known about what the peoples’ experience is like, what implications it has for them (Belliger & Krieger, ; Lupton, ), how they deal with the measures taken and the threat of data leakage. This study explores these questions and adds also the perspective of health professionals and how they deal with the self-obtained data from their patients in their practice.Method: An extensive literature review was conducted to outline the current state and future developments of data-driven self-optimization. Furthermore, three moderated focus groups of about  minutes each with - persons were conducted: one group with healthy individuals, one with chronically ill individuals and one with health professionals. In addition, a meet-up of the Quantified Self group in Zurich, was attended. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content-analyzed.Results: The analysis shows that healthy individuals measure their body states and behavior mainly out of fun, interest of the body, curiosity and for documentation purposes. Improving their health is often only a secondary goal. People with a chronic illness in contrast measure mainly for disease management purposes. They strive to maintain their health and rebuild normality and independence alongside their health issue. In using electronic devices and self-obtained data, they are trying to maintain everyday life (Haslbeck et al., ; Mahrer Imhof et al., ). Corbin and Strauss () refer to these disease management activities as \"illness work\". Quantified Self-technologies contribute to illness work, e.g. taking medication, measuring glucose or sleep. Individuals with chronic diseases attach great importance to data security and therefore tend to use conventional measuring devices or obtain all together from any device that has capacity to go online. For both groups, the measurement results have an impact on everyday life. Health professionals are currently very reluctant to make use of self-measured data from their patients and prefer to measure themselves. Furthermore, they are reluctant in recommending such devices to their patients. The analysis showed a gap between the users need for guidance in choosing a good product and make use of the data and the health professionals willingness to provide guidance and coaching.","doc_id":20499,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"66","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11502","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Age- and level-dependence of fatty infiltration in lumbar paravertebral muscles of healthy volunteers","authors":"Crawford, Rebecca J.; Filli, L.; Elliott, J.M.; Nanz, D.; Fischer, M.A.; Marcon, M.; Ulbrich, E.J.","subject":"Body Mass Index; ElectriciImpedance; Low back pain; Lumbosacral region; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Sex characteristics;  Orthopädische Chirurgie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"617.5","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Age- and level-dependence of fatty infiltration in lumbar paravertebral muscles of healthy volunteers; Body Mass Index; ElectriciImpedance; Low back pain; Lumbosacral region; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Sex characteristics;  Orthopädische Chirurgie; Background and purpose: Normative age-related decline in paravertebral muscle quality is important for reference to disease and risk identification in patients.

The fat signal fraction was highest at L (women, .% ± .%; men, .% ± .%; P < .). The fat signal fraction at L correlated best with total lumbar fat signal fraction (women, r = .; men, r = ., P < .). Total fat signal fraction was higher in the multifidus compared with erector spinae muscles at L-L for both sexes (P < .).Conclusions: Lumbar paravertebral muscle fat content increases with aging, independent of volume, in healthy volunteers - years of age. Women, low lumbar levels, and the multifidus muscle are most affected. Further study examining younger and older subjects and the functional impact of fatty infiltrated paravertebral muscles are warranted.","doc_id":20516,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22940","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"A Swiss health care professionals’ perspective on the meaning of interprofessional collaboration in health care of people with MS : a focus group study","authors":"Schmid, Fabienne; Rogan, Slavko; Glässel, Andrea","subject":"Focus group; Health care professional; Interprofessional collaboration; Multiple sclerosis; Qualitative research;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"A Swiss health care professionals’ perspective on the meaning of interprofessional collaboration in health care of people with MS : a focus group study; Focus group; Health care professional; Interprofessional collaboration; Multiple sclerosis; Qualitative research;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Part of the Special Issue Health Care from Patients' Perspective; Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system mainly of adults ranging from  to  years of age. The risk of developing MS is % higher in women than in men. Most people with MS (PwMS) experience a spectrum of symptoms such as spasticity, continence dysfunctions, fatigue, or neurobehavioral manifestations. Due to the complexity of MS and the variety of patient-centered needs, a comprehensive approach of interprofessional collaboration (IPC) of multiple health care professionals (HCP) is necessary. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the meaning of IPC in the comprehensive care of PwMS from a HCP perspective. Focus groups (FG) with HCP were conducted, recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The sample contained HCP from three MS clinics in different phases of care and rehabilitation. Four main categories emerged: (a) experience with IPC, (b) relevant aspects for IPC in patients' treatment, (c) differences in in- and outpatient settings, and (d) influence of patient perspective. IPC plays a crucial role in the HCP perspective when treating PwMS, which can benefit from an IPC therapeutic approach because HCP work together in a patient-centered way. The inpatient setting of HCP strongly supports the implementation of IPC. This prerequisite does not exist in outpatient settings.","doc_id":20562,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7105","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Nachweis für die Existenz unterschiedlicher Wirt-Pathogen-Interaktionen zwischen dem Wildapfel Malus × robusta 5 und dem Erreger des Feuerbrandes (Erwinia amylovora) mittels QTL-Kartierung","authors":"Wöhner, T.; Vogt, I.; Richter, K.; Wensing, A.; Geider, K.; Sundin, G.-W.; Savory, E.-A.; Day, B.; Hanke, V.; Gessler, C.; Broggini, G.; Fahrentrapp, Johannes; Peil, A.; Flachowsky, H.","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"630","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Nachweis für die Existenz unterschiedlicher Wirt-Pathogen-Interaktionen zwischen dem Wildapfel Malus × robusta  und dem Erreger des Feuerbrandes (Erwinia amylovora) mittels QTL-Kartierung; Proof of existence of different host-pathogen interactions between the wild apple (Malus × robusta) and the causal agent of fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) by means of QTL mapping;  Landwirtschaft; Feuerbrand zählt zu den gefährlichsten Pflanzenkrankheiten im Kernobstanbau weltweit. Die Krankheit wird verursacht durch das Bakterium Erwinia amylovora (Burrill) Winslow. Eine effektive Bekämpfung des Feuerbrandes ist zurzeit nur mit streptomycinhaltigen Pflanzenschutzmitteln möglich. Deren Anwendung ist in Deutschland jedoch nur in Ausnahmefällen möglich. Ein Ausweg aus dieser Situation wird unter anderem auch im Anbau resistenter Sorten gesehen. Viele der im Anbau erfolgreichen Apfelsorten sind jedoch anfällig gegenüber Feuerbrand. Aus diesem Grund stellt die Züchtung feuerbrandresistenter Apfelsorten eines der Hauptziele in vielen Züchtungsprogrammen in der Welt dar. Resistenzen sind hauptsächlich bei Apfelwildarten beschrieben. Diese dienen somit als wichtige genetische Ressource für die Resistenzzüchtung. Bei einer ersten QTL-Kartierung in der Kreuzungspopulation 'Idared' x Malus × robusta  (Mr) mit dem Erwinia amylovora Erregerstamm Ea konnte ein QTL auf Chromosom  in Mr detektiert werden. Das führt zu der Annahme, dass die Resistenz gegen Feuerbrand in Mr von einem einzelnen Gen determiniert wird. Auch nach Inokulation mit dem Wildtypstamm Ea konnte der QTL auf Chromosom  nachgewiesen werden. Im Gegensatz dazu brach der QTL in Mr nach der Inokulation mit der avrRpt Deletionsmutante pZYRKD- des Stammes Ea zusammen. Die durchschnittliche Länge der Triebnekrose aller Nachkommen betrug % und % für die beiden Stämme pZYRKD- und Ea.

The Wi-Fi Direct standard provides a fast, stable, and secure connection which can be easily established between devices without requiring a wireless access point or an Internet connection. This is especially important as users of mobile phones can keep connection to several devices simultaneously without interrupting their Internet connection. Compared to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct is more secure, operates at data rates of up to  Mbps, and covers distances up to  meters. We will give a short overview of Wi-Fi direct in general and then describe how it can be used for proximity-based applications such as ticketing systems, localized advertising and dynamic crowd management (e.g. football stadiums). The specialty of our implementation of Wi-Fi direct is that we utilize a star-like network. In this network, our server node works as the group owner in its center. All clients connect to the server node, which takes care of authentication, dynamic IP assignment and blacklisting. This architecture has also the advantage that it can be extended to service more clients by chaining server nodes together. In this paper, we describe the software components of our system and discuss the critical aspects of its design with respect to security, notification, and authentication.

Our inductive qualitative study of corporate social responsibility (CSR) managers in multinational corporations (MNCs) prompts to rethink the validity of this assumption. We show that as the institutionalization of CSR advances and consolidates, CSR managers are pushed to the organizational periphery. This indicates that the relationship between professionalization and institutionalization can be ‘asymmetric’ under certain conditions. To advance the study of this asymmetry, we develop a conceptual framework and a set of corresponding propositions that explain why some groups are able to advance their professionalization projects, while others cannot. Our study makes three main contributions to the literature: First, we explicate under which conditions the relationship between institutionalization and professionalization is more likely asymmetric than symmetric. Second, our explanation of the shifting organizational positions of different professional groups allows for further delineating occupational from organizational professionals. Third, we contribute to the CSR literature by examining the dynamic yet ambiguous role of CSR managers as driving forces behind the implementation of CSR.","doc_id":21490,"prior":"corporate social responsibility","SDG12":1},{"id":"93","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22365","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Food waste digestion : anaerobic digestion of food waste for a circular economy","authors":"Banks, Charles; Heaven, Sonja; Zhang, Yue; Baier, Urs; Murphy, Jerry","subject":"Biomasse; Bioenergie; Food waste; Lebensmittelabfall; Biogas; Circular economy;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Food waste digestion : anaerobic digestion of food waste for a circular economy; Biomasse; Bioenergie; Food waste; Lebensmittelabfall; Biogas; Circular economy;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; There is increasing awareness of the quantities of food that are lost every year across the globe; while the quality of available data varies, estimates suggest the total is around . billion tonnes.

Aim and approach usedIncreased energy supply from photovoltaics is a main priority in the “Energy Strategy ”. Within the joint research project \"Next generation photovoltaics\" funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, we analysed different options for the enhanced integration of photovoltaic technologies into the envelope of Swiss buildings (BIPV). The PV modules for building integration are using novel monolithic silicon heterojunction organometallic perovskite tandem cells (SHJ-PSC) with adaptions to improve the visual acceptance. In a joint effort of product developers, architects and scientists, this project aimed at providing pathways for the wide-scale use of BIPV façade solutions, and developing integrated designs based on emerging high-efficiency module technologies to improve the visual aspect and acceptance of PV systems installed in Switzerland. These so-called active façades incorporating BIPV modules to generate electricity can provide a significant contribution to the energy transition away from fossil and nuclear fuels. We compared the environmental impacts of different façade construction systems with and without SHJ-PSC BIPV modules with improved visual design, using a prospective life cycle assessment with a time horizon of .

This façade design is based on low-embodied-energy construction principles, it is defined by a non-loadbearing wood-panel substructure and it integrates a double layer of natural insulation: cellulose and wood-fibre. In addition, its design incorporates an opaque SHJ-PSC BIPV façade-cladding following contemporary façade design trends. (Figure ). The use of photovoltaic modules integrated into the façade cladding or roof will increase the environmental impact of the building envelope, compared to using conventional construction materials. The environmental impacts of the AAF using PV modules are two to four times higher compared to a conventional façade. The PV modules cause the highest share of greenhouse gas emissions of the AAF with about  kg CO-eq per square meter (see Figure ). The additional materials required to build the AAF including exterior panels, insulation and other materials cause about  kg CO-eq per square meter of façade. The brick and timber frame façades cause greenhouse gas emissions around  and  kg CO-eq, respectively. If the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the PV module is excluded this will result in a reduction between  and  kg CO-eq per square meter of façade.However, the environmental impacts of the AAF are significantly reduced if the whole life cycle is considered due to the PV electricity produced by the building. Therefore, we calculated the saved greenhouse gas emissions due to the electricity produced by the advanced active façade and fed to the European electricity grid using the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the current European electricity mix as reference. These calculated savings due to the electricity produced by the BIPV are about  times higher than the impacts of the advanced active façade. Incorporating BIPV panels into building’s façades will cause net savings of about  kg CO-eq per square meter over the whole life cycle of BIPV façades, while simultaneously saving up to  kg CO-eq per square meter of façade for the reduced material demand to build the façade (see Figure ). We performed this analysis for  different environmental impacts according to the recommended midpoints by the Joint Research Council of the European Commission. The results were comparable to greenhouse gas emissions with the net saved environmental impacts being many times higher for all the environmental impacts analysed except mineral resource use caused by the indium used in the novel SHJ-PSC tandem module (see Figure ).To conclude, the use of PV modules in AAF can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions per square meter of façade between  and  % if the production of the PV module and its produced electricity are excluded. If the production and life cycle of the PV modules are included into the analysis the AAF will cause net greenhouse gas savings up to four times higher than the production of the AAF itself. The results for environmental impacts other than greenhouse gases were similar except for mineral resource depletion. Overall, the building integration of photovoltaic modules as AAF will reduce the environmental impacts of the building while simultaneously providing a visually appealing building envelope.","doc_id":22091,"prior":"production","posterior":"resource use","SDG12":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20715","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Active façades : life cycle environmental impacts and savings of photovoltaic power plants integrated into the building envelope","authors":"Itten, René; Stucki, Matthias; Clua Longas, Angela; Cattaneo, Gianluca","subject":"Life cycle assessment; Photvoltaic; Building; Integration; Prevoskite; Greenhouse gas emission; Facade;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"621.3, 690","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Active façades : life cycle environmental impacts and savings of photovoltaic power plants integrated into the building envelope; Life cycle assessment; Photvoltaic; Building; Integration; Prevoskite; Greenhouse gas emission; Facade;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk; . Aim and approach usedIncreased energy supply from photovoltaics is a main priority in the “Energy Strategy ”. Within the joint research project \"Next generation photovoltaics\" funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, we analysed different options for the enhanced integration of photovoltaic technologies into the envelope of Swiss buildings (BIPV). The PV modules for building integration are using novel monolithic silicon heterojunction organometallic perovskite tandem cells (SHJ-PSC) with adaptions to improve the visual acceptance. In a joint effort of product developers, architects and scientists, this project aimed at providing pathways for the wide-scale use of BIPV façade solutions, and developing integrated designs based on emerging high-efficiency module technologies to improve the visual aspect and acceptance of PV systems installed in Switzerland. These so-called active façades incorporating BIPV modules to generate electricity can provide a significant contribution to the energy transition away from fossil and nuclear fuels.

We propose a novel paradigm which compares the two nodes’ ultra-wideband (UWB) channels to other nodes, called observers. The main idea is that the dissimilarity between the channel impulse responses (CIRs) increases with d and allows for an estimate d_hat. Our approach relies on extracting common multipath components (MPCs) from the CIRs. This is realistic in indoor or urban scenarios and if d is considerably smaller than the distances to the observers.We present distance estimators which utilize the rich location information contained in MPC delay differences. Likewise, we present estimators for the relative position vector which process both MPC delays and MPC directions. We do so for various important cases: with and without time synchronization, delay measurement errors, and knowledge of the MPC association between the two CIRs. The estimators exhibit great technolog- ical advantages: they do not require line-of-sight conditions or knowledge about the observer locations or the environment.We study the estimation accuracy with a numerical evaluation based on random sampling and, additionally, with an experimen- tal evaluation based on measurements in an indoor environment. The proposal shows the potential for great accuracy in theory and practice. We describe how the paradigm could be incorporated into established cooperative localization frameworks to provide them with novel inter- and intra-node measurements for spatio- temporal tracking. This could enable low-cost localization of wireless users or networks in dynamic multipath settings.","doc_id":22181,"prior":"wireless","SDG12":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2866","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Relative validation of a food frequency questionnaire to estimate food intake in an adult population","authors":"Steinemann, Nina; Grize, Leticia; Ziesemer, Katrin; Kauf, Peter; Probst-Hensch, Nicole; Brombach, Christine","subject":"Food frequency questionnaire; Dietary assessment; Epidemiological studies; Food group intake; Nutrient intake; Validation study; Weighed food record;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Diätetik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"000, 613.2","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Relative validation of a food frequency questionnaire to estimate food intake in an adult population; Food frequency questionnaire; Dietary assessment; Epidemiological studies; Food group intake; Nutrient intake; Validation study; Weighed food record;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Diätetik; Background: Scientifically valid descriptions of dietary intake at population level are crucial for investigating diet effects on health and disease.

Biodiversity impacts are mainly caused by cocoa and coffee (% of total) and by beef (%).

A total of  online retailer participated in the  study, which encompasses business-to-consumer ( percent), business-to-business ( percent) and direct-to-consumer ( percent) companies. For the first time,  Austrian retailers took part, besides a representative  Swiss companies.After a record year in , the e-commerce boom is continuing, with online sales in  of  billion Swiss francs in Switzerland, which is about  percent more than in . E-commerce has made a five-year leap in growth since the beginning of the Corona crisis one and a half years ago. Online retail is booming, with nine out of  of the online shops surveyed seeing sales growth in , and a third seeing very strong growth of over  percent. Due to an increased stay-at-home attitude and changed consumer behavior, assortments in the home and sporting goods segments have grown strongly (more than  percent compared to the previous year) for two-thirds of online retailers since the Corona crisis. Half of the retailers are also selling more food, cosmetics, toys, and furniture online than before the Corona crisis. Nine out of  online shops have gained new customers as a result of the Corona crisis, half of them even a great number. One in five have customers who have been buying more and more frequently since the start of the Corona crisis, and in a further fifth of them, customers are not buying more, but more frequently. Small and large online shops alike are benefiting from this e-commerce boom. For example, Galaxus, the leading digital marketplace in Switzerland, has been able to significantly increase its market share not only among customers, but also among retailers.Half of Swiss retailers believe that the decline of physical stores is an upward trend due to increased online commerce. On the other hand, a third of omnichannel retailers believe in the potential of new store formats such as showrooms, click and collect, pick-up, experiential and consultative stores, pop-up stores, and self-service stores.Due to the ongoing strong growth of e-commerce, online retailers have invested a lot in the digital value chain: The extension of product ranges, the hiring of additional staff, and the expansion of warehouse and logistics capacities were mentioned very frequently by the survey participants. Business processes had to be further digitized, and retailers report growing budgets in digital sales and marketing. The study results also confirm that Corona further accelerated the digital transformation and upgraded the value of e-commerce departments. Regarding the organizational, personnel, and cultural impact of the strong e-commerce growth, it can be stated empirically that the demand shock not only created many new jobs, but also new types of job profiles with new requirements. In addition, according to online retailers, the Corona crisis strengthened the digital mindset, cohesion, and solidarity within their teams.The main e-commerce problems currently are currently found in the market and in procurement: Some products are no longer available from manufacturers, importers, or major suppliers, international supply chains have been interrupted or have slowed down in some cases, and purchasing and logistics prices have risen since the Corona crisis.To take advantage of this increased demand for online goods, and attract online customers to their own online stores, almost all companies rely increasingly on digital marketing. Nowadays, no online shop operator can avoid search engines, newsletters, and social media marketing. Thus, the search engines (first and foremost Google) and social media platforms (first and foremost Facebook and Instagram) are among the big winners of the Corona crisis. According to the study results, the Corona losers in terms of marketing and communication are advertisements, newspaper supplements, and sponsoring. For three quarters of online shops, the online marketing budget has grown since the Corona crisis, and the budget has shifted further from offline to online marketing instruments. Services such as click-and-collect or live chat have also gained in importance, while innovative omnichannel retailers have introduced virtual store tours (-degree tours) and video advice. No major changes were reported in the methods of payment: Purchase on account, PayPal, as well as credit and debit cards are most widely used by retailers. Mobile payment solutions such as TWINT in Switzerland continue to gain market share.","doc_id":22628,"prior":"consumer behavior","SDG12":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12076","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Measuring the perceived morphological complexity of intracranial aneurysms","authors":"Juchler, Norman; Schilling, Sabine; Bijlenga, Philippe; Kurtcuoglu, Vartan; Hirsch, Sven","subject":"Morphology; Intracranial aneurysms;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"616","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Measuring the perceived morphological complexity of intracranial aneurysms; Morphology; Intracranial aneurysms;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; The rupture of intracranial aneurysms is a potentially deadly event.

Here, we examined the local environment-species relationships of a phytoplasma-mediated grapevine disease on a scale of  m in a . ha vineyard using: (i) data on elevation and habitat types; (ii) cover of host plants Urtica dioica and Convolvulus arvensis over three seasons, (iii) vector monitoring over four seasons; (iv) genetic tests for phytoplasma presence in the vector; and (v) inspection of  grapevine plants for visual symptoms of the ‘bois noir’ disease. The data were analyzed in a joint causal model that describes the interplay between vector, pathogen, disease and environment, estimated with Bayesian inference. Our results indicate that surrounding natural and semi-natural vegetation (fallow land, forest and managed agricultural land) and high density of the major host plant U. dioica are associated with an increase in vector population densities. Higher vector population densities at low availability of U. dioica were associated with higher phytoplasma infection rates in the vector. The prevalence of disease symptoms in grapevine plants was nonetheless more affected by grapevine cultivar and higher elevation than by the estimated availability of infected vectors. The results of our local analysis support current bois noir management recommendations stating that () removal of the host plant U. dioica should be best carried out in either spring or autumn; and () grapevine cultivars are unequally susceptible. Moreover, we provide evidence that U. dioica control before the flight period may result in low U. dioica densities and high H. obsoletus population densities, causing an increase in vector infection rates and disease pressure.; Die Schwarzholzkrankheit (Bois noir) ist eine durch Phytoplasmen ausgelöste Vergilbungskrankheit auf Reben, welche erhebliche ökonomische Schäden im europäischen Rebbau verursacht. Bisherige epidemiolgische Studien zu den Habitatassoziationen von Bois noir konzentrierten sich auf die regionale Ebene. Lokale Standortfaktoren, wie das vom Überträgerinsekt (Hyalesthes obsoletus, Hemiptera: Cixiidae), bevorzugte Mikroklima oder lokale Interaktionen mit den Wirtspflanzen, wurden bis jetzt kaum untersucht. Jedoch sind gerade diese notwendig für die Entwicklung standortspezifischer Bekämpfungsstrategien.Wir untersuchten die kleinräumigen “Umwelt-Art-Beziehungen” dieser Vergilbungskrankheit in einer räumlichen Auflösung von  m in einem . ha großen Rebberg. Dabei verwendeten wir die folgenden Daten: (i) Höhe (m ü. NN) und Landschaftskontext; (ii) Deckungsgrad von den Wirtspflanzen Urtica dioica und Convolvulus arvensis aus drei Jahren; (iii) Gelbfallenfänge von H. obsoletus aus vier Jahren; (iv) molekulare Phytoplasmennachweise in Überträgerinsekten; und (v) Symptomausprägung der Schwarzholzkrankheit auf  bonitierten Rebstöcken.Unsere Ergebnisse zeigten, dass natürliche und naturnahe Bereiche (wie Brachflächen, Wälder, Grasflächen) in der näheren Umgebung und hohe Deckungsgrade der wichtigsten Wirtspflanze, U. dioica, mit zunehmenden Fangzahlen des Überträgerinsektes korrelierten. Höhere Populationsdichten korrelierten außerdem mit höheren Durchseuchungsraten bei geringem Vorkommen der Wirtspflanze U. dioica. Das Auftreten von Krankheitssymptomen an Weinreben war allerdings deutlich stärker beeinflußt von der Weinsorte und der Meereshöhe als vom geschätzten Vorkommen an infizierten Überträgerinsekten.Die Modellergebnisse unserer kleinräumigen Untersuchung bestätigen bestehende Managementstrategien, dass () die Wirtspflanze U. dioica im Frühjahr oder Herbst bekämpft werden sollte und dass () die Ausprägung der Symptome in Abhängigkeit von der jeweiligen Rebsorte unterschiedlich stark sind. Darüber hinaus zeigen wir, dass eine Bekämpfung von U. dioica, welche eine nicht vollständige Entfernung der Wirtspflanze zu Folge hat, bei anschließender hohen Populationsdichte des Vektors, eine hohe Durchseuchung des Vektors und damit höheren Befallsdruck auf die Weinreben zur Folge haben kann.","doc_id":22894,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"4","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13235","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Advances in the biofabrication of 3D skin in vitro : healthy and pathological models","authors":"Randall, Matthew J.; Jüngel, Astrid; Rimann, Markus; Wuertz-Kozak, Karin","subject":"3D tissue model; Biofabrication; Bioprinting; Electrospinning; In vitro; Preclinical testing; Skin; Skin disease;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Biotechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610, 660.6","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Advances in the biofabrication of D skin in vitro : healthy and pathological models; D tissue model; Biofabrication; Bioprinting; Electrospinning; In vitro; Preclinical testing; Skin; Skin disease;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Biotechnologie; The relevance for in vitro three-dimensional (D) tissue culture of skin has been present for almost a century.

Dies, weil sie das Thema als zu wenig fassbar empfinden und sich unter anderem fragen, ob sie mit nachhaltigen Anlagen wirklich etwas bewirken können. Die Zielsetzungen dieser Masterarbeit bestehen darin, Argumente für nachhaltige Anlagen zu erarbeiten und eine Vorgehensweise bei der Auswahl von nachhaltigen Anlagen zu entwickeln.Neben den Kriterien, dass Geld sicher und renditebringend angelegt werden soll, werden auch nachhaltige Gesichtspunkte aus dem sozialen, ökologischen und ethischen Bereich bei der Suche nach geeigneten Anlagelösungen immer wichtiger. Diese extrafinanziellen Kriterien, auch ESG-Kriterien genannt, werden unterschiedlich definiert, was eine enggefasste Umschreibung des Begriffs \"Nachhaltigkeit\" schwierig macht. Breit akzeptiert ist die Brundtland-Definition, welche Nachhaltigkeit als eine Entwicklung beschreibt, bei der die Bedürfnisse der Gegenwart befriedigt werden, ohne zu riskieren, dass künftige Generationen ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse nicht mehr befriedigen können.Sowohl das Anlageuniversum als auch das Volumen im nachhaltigen Anlagebereich nehmen stetig zu. Dies macht es für Anleger zunehmend schwieriger, den Überblick zu behalten und die passende Anlagelösung zu finden. Unterstützung dabei bieten verschiedene Ratingagenturen, Nachhaltigkeitslabels und Indikatoren. Die verschiedenen Kennzahlen sind für die meisten Anleger jedoch nicht verständlich, was dazu führt, dass nachhaltige Anlagen manchmal als intransparent bezeichnet werden.Der Entscheid, in nachhaltige Anlagen zu investieren, beruht unter anderem auf dem Argument, dass diese finanziell nicht schlechter abschneiden als konventionelle Anlagen, zusätzlich aber noch über einen sozialen und ökologischen Mehrwert verfügen. Ausserdem bieten Nachhaltigkeitsindikatoren einen zusätzlichen Nutzen bei der Beurteilung und Erkennung von Risiken. Weiter hat ein Anleger bei gewissen nachhaltigen Anlagestrategien die Möglichkeit zu entscheiden, in welche Branchen er gemäss seinen ethischen Kriterien investieren möchte oder nicht. Ein weiteres Argument besteht darin, dass durch den Kauf einer nachhaltigen Anlage die entsprechenden Unternehmen motiviert werden, nachhaltig zu denken und zu wirtschaften. Das Fundament für eine erfolgreiche Beratung im Bezug auf die Auswahl von nachhaltigen Anlagen ist die Bedürfnisanalyse. Nur wenn klar ist, welche nachhaltigen Kriterien eine Anlagelösung erfüllen sollte und was der Kunde genau unter Nachhaltigkeit versteht, kann das passende Anlageprodukt gefunden werden. Neben dem Anlagebedürfnis ist auch die Kenntnis der finanziellen Situation, des Risikoprofils und der Anlagestrategie des Kunden unabdingbar.Die Auswahl nachhaltiger Anlagealternativen stellt für Kundenberater eine herausfordernde Aufgabe dar. Aufgrund von fehlender Transparenz auf den Factsheets muss die Selektion gemäss verschiedenen Kriterien selber vorgenommen werden. Trotzdem konnte in der Masterarbeit aufgezeigt werden, dass für fast alle Positionen eines bestehenden Anlageportfolios eine nachhaltige Alternative gefunden werden kann.","doc_id":23304,"prior":"Nachhaltigkeitslabels","SDG12":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20066","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Powering Sigfox nodes with harvested energy","authors":"Meli, Marcel; Stajic, Stefan; Wick, Stefan","subject":"Energy harvesting; Low power; LPWAN; Sigfox;  Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Powering Sigfox nodes with harvested energy; Energy harvesting; Low power; LPWAN; Sigfox;  Informatik; Sigfox is one of the popular LPWAN technologies used in the Internet of Things.

Currently, transdermal sensing techniques are severely limited in scope (i.e., measurement of heart rate or sweat composition), or else tend to be invasive, often needing to be performed in a clinical setting. This study proposes a minimally invasive alternative strategy, consisting of using dissolving polymeric microneedles to deliver naked eye-invisible functional fluorescent ratiometric microneedle tattoos directly to the skin for real-time monitoring and quantification of physiological and pathological parameters. Reactive oxygen species are overexpressed in the skin in association with various pathological conditions. Here, one demonstrates for the first time the microneedle-based delivery to the skin of active fluorescent sensors in the form of an invisible, ratiometric microneedle tattoo capable of sensing reactive oxygen species in a reconstructed human-based skin disease model, as well as an in vivo model of UV-induced dermal inflammation. One also elaborates a universal ratiometric quantification concept coupled with a custom-built, multiwavelength portable fluorescence detection system. Fully realized, this approach presents an opportunity for the minimally invasive monitoring of a broad range of physiological parameters through the skin.","doc_id":23381,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"99","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7157","date":"2018","language":"fr","title":"Récolte d’énergie pour alimentation des réseaux personnels sans fil : plus d’autonomie, plus d’économies, plus d’écologie!","authors":"Meli, Marcel","subject":"Energierückgewinnung; Wireless; Récolte d'énergie; Energy harvesting;  Informatik;  Energie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"004, 333.79","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Récolte d’énergie pour alimentation des réseaux personnels sans fil : plus d’autonomie, plus d’économies, plus d’écologie!; Energierückgewinnung; Wireless; Récolte d'énergie; Energy harvesting;  Informatik;  Energie; Pour certaines applications dans lesquelles les capteurs sont associés en réseaux personnels sans fil, il peut être très coûteux ou même impossible de procéder à un remplacement de batteries.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, costs and benefits of following a standardised multiprofessional, multicomponent delirium guideline on eight outcomes: delirium prevalence and duration, lengths of stay in ICU and hospital, in-hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and cost and nursing hours per case. It also aimed to explore the associations of delirium with length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation.METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a pre-post design. ICU patients in an historical control group (n = ) who received standard ICU care were compared with a postintervention group (n = ) who received standardised delirium management – delirium risk identification, preventive measures, screening and treatment – with regard to eight outcomes. The delirium management guideline was developed and implemented in  by a group of experts from the study hospital. As appropriate, descriptive statistics and multivariate, multilevel models were used to compare the two groups and to explore the association between delirium occurrence and the selected outcomes.RESULTS: Twelve percent of the  historical controls and % of the  postintervention patients were diagnosed with delirium according to the ICD- delirium diagnosis codes. Patients being treated for heart disease, and those with septic shock, ARDS, renal insufficiency (acute or chronic), older age and higher numbers of comorbidities were significantly more likely to develop delirium during their stay. Multivariate models comparing the historical controls with the post intervention group indicated significant differences in delirium period prevalence (odds ratio ., % confidence interval [CI] .–.; p <.), length of stay in the ICU (time ratio [TR] ., CI .–.; p = .), cost per case (median difference ., CI .–.; p = .) and duration of mechanical ventilation (TR ., CI .–.; p <.). The observed differences in the other four outcomes – in-hospital mortality, delirium duration, length of stay in the hospital, and nursing hours per case – were not significant. Delirium was a significant predictor for prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and for both ICU and hospital stay.CONCLUSION: Standardised delirium management, specifically delirium screening, supports timely detection of delirium in ICU patients. Increased awareness of delirium after the implementation of standardised multiprofessional, multicomponent management leads to increased therapeutic attention, a prolongation of ICU stay and increased costs, but with no influence on mortality.","doc_id":23449,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12488","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Screening for delirium with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) : symptom profile and utility of individual items in the identification of delirium dependent on the level of sedation","authors":"Boettger, Soenke; Meyer, Rafael; Richter, André; Fernandez, Susana Franco; Rudiger, Alain; Schubert, Maria; Jenewein, Josef; Nuñez, David Garcia","subject":"Text revision (DSM-IV-TR); Delirium; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC); Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS); Intensive care unit (ICU); Phenomenology;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610.73, 616","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Screening for delirium with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) : symptom profile and utility of individual items in the identification of delirium dependent on the level of sedation; Text revision (DSM-IV-TR); Delirium; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC); Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS); Intensive care unit (ICU); Phenomenology;  Pflege;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; th edition; Objective: The importance of the proper identification of delirium, with its high incidence and adversities in the intensive care setting, has been widely recognized. One common screening instrument is the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC); however, the symptom profile and key features of delirium dependent on the level of sedation have not yet been evaluated.Method: In this prospective cohort study, the ICDSC was evaluated versus the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, th edition, text revision, diagnosis of delirium set as standard with respect to the symptom profile, and correct identification of delirium. The aim of this study was to identify key features of delirium in the intensive care setting dependent on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale levels of sedation: drowsiness versus alert and calmness.Result: The  delirious patients of  were older, had more severe disease, and prolonged hospitalization. Irrespective of the level of sedation, delirium was correctly classified by items related to inattention, disorientation, psychomotor alterations, inappropriate speech or mood, and symptom fluctuation. In the drowsy patients, inattention reached substantial sensitivity and specificity, whereas psychomotor alterations and sleep-wake cycle disturbances were sensitive lacked specificity. The positive prediction was substantial across items, whereas the negative prediction was only moderate. In the alert and calm patient, the sensitivities were substantial for psychomotor alterations, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, and symptom fluctuations; however, these fluctuations were not specific. The positive prediction was moderate and the negative prediction substantial. Between the nondelirious drowsy and alert, the symptom profile was similar; however, drowsiness was associated with alterations in consciousness.Significance of results: In the clinical routine, irrespective of the level of sedation, delirium was characterized by the ICDSC items for inattention, disorientation, psychomotor alterations, inappropriate speech or mood and symptom fluctuation. Further, drowsiness caused altered levels of consciousness.","doc_id":23456,"prior":"disease","SDG12":1},{"id":"91","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15283","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Wachstumsfördernde Wirkung durch Mischung von Mikroorganismen und Biostimulanzien","authors":"Bühner, Monika","subject":"Biostimulanzien; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; FZB42; Aminosäuren; Huminsäuren; Brunalgenextrakt (Ascophyllum nodosum); Pechnelkenextrakt (Lychnis viscaria); Gemüsebau; Lactuca sativa; Topfversuche;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"630","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Wachstumsfördernde Wirkung durch Mischung von Mikroorganismen und Biostimulanzien; Biostimulanzien; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; FZB; Aminosäuren; Huminsäuren; Brunalgenextrakt (Ascophyllum nodosum); Pechnelkenextrakt (Lychnis viscaria); Gemüsebau; Lactuca sativa; Topfversuche;  Landwirtschaft; Im Handel werden verschiedene Biostimulanzien für einen nachhaltigen Pflanzenbau angeboten.
