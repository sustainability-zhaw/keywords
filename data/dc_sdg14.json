However, since the year , Sino-African trade volumes and Chinese loans to Africa began to rise rapidly. This was further bolstered by the establishment of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).This thesis aimed to investigate the implications of the Sino-African relationship. Research was divided into five objectives in order answer the final question of whether the presence of China contributes to sustainable development in Africa. Secondary data was collected with key observations from the findings being discussed with relevant theories in order to examine China’s contribution to the three development levels, namely, economic, human and environmental stewardship. The first section of the findings presented a performance review of Africa against the UN SDGs. This review revealed a dire situation of poverty and unemployment in Africa as well as the prevalence of deeply entrenched corruption. The second section of the findings displayed the performance of China’s businesses against the UN Global Compact’s principles for responsible businesses. The results from this were mixed. While Chinese companies performed well with workforce localization and skills training, they did not score well on corruption and pollution. The third and final findings section aimed to find out what the BRI brings for Africa. It was found that Africa gains from the relationship through the construction of much needed infrastructure. However, considering that the BRI is labeled as a development strategy, China’s impact on job creation in Africa has not yet reached its potential. China on the other hand benefits handsomely from Africa’s participation in the project, as it gains access to raw materials and markets to sustain domestic economic growth.The key observations were then contextualized with relevant theories to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon’s observed. Concerning economic development, findings showed that the case for Africa as the next flying geese was weak, with some notable exceptions in East Africa due to a stable political system. In the case for human development, the extractive institutions theory showed that China needs to assist in anti-corruption measures. In the context of the world systems theory, it was decided that there is a case for exploitation, however, Africa has overall benefitted from the relationship and therefore caution is taken with labeling the relationship as such. From an environmental perspective, the thesis found evidence of China relocating factories that do not meet their own environmental standards. China has since, with pressure from foreign powers, implemented a more environmentally friendly approach to its BRI projects.Limitations of this thesis revolve around the lack of readily and reliable information. China has in the past been accused of underreporting trade and loan data, whereas Africa lacked statistical capacity to gather information. Having said this, continuous workings from the China Africa Research Initiative as well as the largest field study on Chinese companies by McKinsey & Company allowed this thesis to carry out a holistic study. Recommendations for further research suggest focusing on an in-depth analysis on single countries or regions in Africa, as a contrast to analyzing Africa as a single entity.","doc_id":185,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21133","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Butterflies of fragmented wet grassland in Western European lowland forests : effects of vegetation, connectivity and plot size","authors":"Schlegel, Jürg; Hofstetter, Andreas","subject":" Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Butterflies of fragmented wet grassland in Western European lowland forests : effects of vegetation, connectivity and plot size;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Habitat fragmentation, as a result of habitat loss and degradation, is widely considered to be a major threat to biodiversity.

In order to fill this gap a feeding trial with juvenile carp was conducted. The fish were fed ZEN-contaminated diets at three concentrations (low:  μg kg−, medium:  μg kg−, and high:  μg kg− final feed, respectively) for four weeks. Possible reversible effects of ZEN were evaluated by feeding an additional group with the mycotoxin for four weeks period and the  uncontaminated diet for further two weeks. After that possible ZEN effects on enzyme activities in kidney, spleen, liver and muscle tissue were investigated to get an organism-wide aspect of ZEN effects. Most organs appeared to (over)compensate ZEN effects during the exposure to this mycotoxin, which caused metabolic costs. Oxygen consumption increased in fish treated with the two higher ZEN concentrations via the diet. The differences between the treatments persisted also after the recovery phase of two weeks. Thus, the present study provided evidence of effects of ZEN on carbohydrate metabolism, lipid peroxidation in organs and metabolic oxygen demand. This is the first evidence for increased metabolic costs in a fish species due to exposure to the mycotoxin ZEN.","doc_id":250,"prior":"fish species","sdg14":1},{"id":"87","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20517","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Synchrony matters more than species richness in plant community stability at a global scale","authors":"Valencia, Enrique; de Bello, Francesco; Galland, Thomas; Adler, Peter B.; Lepš, Jan; E-Vojtkó, Anna; van Klink, Roel; Carmona, Carlos P.; Danihelka, Jiří; Dengler, Jürgen; Eldridge, David J.; Estiarte, Marc; García-González, Ricardo; Garnier, Eric; Gómez‐García, Daniel; Harrison, Susan P.; Herben, Tomáš; Ibáñez, Ricardo; Jentsch, Anke; Juergens, Norbert; Kertész, Miklós; Klumpp, Katja; Louault, Frédérique; Marrs, Rob H.; Ogaya, Romà; Ónodi, Gábor; Pakeman, Robin J.; Pardo, Iker; Pärtel, Meelis; Peco, Begoña; Peñuelas, Josep; Pywell, Richard F.; Rueda, Marta; Schmidt, Wolfgang; Schmiedel, Ute; Schuetz, Martin; Skálová, Hana; Šmilauer, Petr; Šmilauerová, Marie; Smit, Christian; Song, MingHua; Stock, Martin; Val, James; Vandvik, Vigdis; Ward, David; Wesche, Karsten; Wiser, Susan K.; Woodcock, Ben A.; Young, Truman P.; Yu, Fei-Hai; Zobel, Martin; Götzenberger, Lars","subject":"Climate change driver; Evenness; Species richness; Stability; Synchrony;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Synchrony matters more than species richness in plant community stability at a global scale; Climate change driver; Evenness; Species richness; Stability; Synchrony;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie; The stability of ecological communities is critical for the stable provisioning of ecosystem services, such as food and forage production, carbon sequestration, and soil fertility. Greater biodiversity is expected to enhance stability across years by decreasing synchrony among species, but the drivers of stability in nature remain poorly resolved. Our analysis of time series from  datasets across the world showed that stability was associated more strongly with the degree of synchrony among dominant species than with species richness. The relatively weak influence of species richness is consistent with theory predicting that the effect of richness on stability weakens when synchrony is higher than expected under random fluctuations, which was the case in most communities. Land management, nutrient addition, and climate change treatments had relatively weak and varying effects on stability, modifying how species richness, synchrony, and stability interact. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of biotic drivers on ecosystem stability, with the potential for environmental drivers to alter the intricate relationship among richness, synchrony, and stability.","doc_id":266,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23727","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Solving the trilemma : climate-friendly, healthy, and popular meals for retirement homes and canteens","authors":"Berger, Verena; Müller, Claudia; Egeler, Gian-Andrea; Muir, Karen; Bradford, Sebastian; Deluchi, Matteo; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"LCA; Food; Meal; Nutrition; Sustainable Food;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927, 640","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Solving the trilemma : climate-friendly, healthy, and popular meals for retirement homes and canteens; LCA; Food; Meal; Nutrition; Sustainable Food;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben; How can retirement homes and canteens transform their catering services into a sustainable business? Using life cycle based information, we developed a database with environmentally friendly, nutritionally balanced and popular meals for retirement homes and canteens. In order to create the database , the life cycle environmental impact of a large sample of  meals from municipal companies was assessed with the Ecological Scarcity Method. From this assessment a subsample of the most environmental friendly meals was selected. In the next step, the recipes were evaluated and optimized using nutritional balance models. Finally, the popularity of the meals  was determined based on sales data. Since the dietary requirements of residents in nursing homes differ greatly from those of guests in canteens, two different databases were created and tested with chefs for comprehensibility and user-friendliness. In addition to the environmental, nutritional, and popularity data for the meals, chefs were provided with the total environmental impact, global warming potential, and cumulative energy use for each constituent. Since factors such as origin, processing, packaging and seasonality differ for each meal preparation, these aspects were dynamically integrated as parameters into the database. Chefs can customize the parameters for their specific ingredients (e.g., from plastic to cardboard packaging) and the environmental impact is adjusted accordingly..With the developed database, the restaurant chefs are enabled to integrate life cycle thinking into their catering service and offer sustainable, healthy and popular meals.  Overall, the selection and optimization of meals reduced the average total environmental impact by % and the global warming potential by % compared to the original meals sample.","doc_id":310,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20333","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Climatic humidity mediates the strength of the species richness-biomass relationship on the Mongolian Plateau steppe","authors":"Li, Zijing; Li, Zhiyong; Tong, Xuze; Zhang, Jing Hui; Dong, Lei; Zheng, Ying; Ma, Wenhong; Zhao, Liqing; Wang, Lixin; Wen, Lu; Dang, Zhenhua; Tuvshintogtokh, Indree; Liang, Cunzhu; Li, Frank Yonghong","subject":"Aboveground biomass; Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship; Climate; Environmental factor; Grassland; Species richness; Humidity; Soil; Biodiversity; Biomass;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Climatic humidity mediates the strength of the species richness-biomass relationship on the Mongolian Plateau steppe; Aboveground biomass; Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship; Climate; Environmental factor; Grassland; Species richness; Humidity; Soil; Biodiversity; Biomass;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie; The relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) have been extensively studied over past decades.

Different rationales and discourses, both project-specific but also more general, influenced the opinions of local stakeholders. Connecting these different opinions was the issue of (dis)trust, which weaves in and out of prominent lines of argumentation and informs individual sentiments. The application of a multidimensional trust framework helps to understand the influence of different types of trust on protected area negotiations. We discuss how a focus on rational trust building can help to sharpen the diverse goals of contemporary protected areas with integrated conservation and economic development schemes, as well as enable the emergence of other types of trust to facilitate conservation debates.","doc_id":477,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1443","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Granitinsel im Kalkmeer","authors":"Hepenstrick, Daniel; Walthard, Peter","subject":" Biologie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"570","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Granitinsel im Kalkmeer; Ilots de granit dans une mer de calcaire; Isole granitiche nel mare calcareo;  Biologie; Vor Jahrtausenden brachten Gletscher sie von den Alpen ins Mittelland und in den Jura: Findlinge aus Granit und anderen kristallinen Gesteinen.

However, while efficient wastewater treatment is possible, the nutrient content of RAS water limits attainable microalgae biomass densities to – g/l at best, which requires frequent harvesting of microalgae. We have taken advantage of the constant evaporation of water from an open thin-layer photobioreactor (  l volume,   m illuminated surface, artificial supply of CO) to continuously add water from RAS to a microalgae culture and thereby provide nutrients for continued growth while evaporating all water. To test for a possible inhibitory effect of RAS water on microalgae growth, components of mineral medium were omitted stepwise in subsequent cultivations and replaced by RAS water as the only source of nutrients. This approach showed that microalgae can be grown successfully for up to three weeks in RAS water without additional nutrients and that high (  g/l) biomass densities can be attained. While growth in wastewater did not reach productivities measured in mineral medium, analysis of growth data suggested that this reduction was not due to an inhibitory effect of the RAS water but due to an insufficient supply rate of nutrients, even though RAS water contained up to   mg/l NO-N. It is, therefore, concluded that this method can be used to fully treat the wastewater discharge of a RAS. Furthermore, because both water evaporation from and microalgae growth in the photobioreactor correlated positively with each other due to their shared dependency on solar radiation, supply of nutrients continuously adjusts to changes in demand.

This is complemented by a thermal model for the heat budget obtained from a projected phase diagram and thermodynamic data. Fractional crystallization (FC) and assimilation–fractional crystallization (AFC) paths have been calculated with these models and the mass ratio of assimilation to crystallization as a function of parent magma type and temperature, crustal rock fertility and temperature, and mechanism of assimilation, have been determined. When these results are combined with F (melt fraction) and r (ratio of mass assimilated/crystallized) values evaluated from geochemical data then new information, not available with the methods separately, can be deduced. This includes when and at what depth and temperature in the crust the assimilation took place, as well as the likely parent magma type and temperature of the assimilant.

Our goal was to develop a tool for assigning vegetation-plot records to the habitats of the EUNIS system, use it to classify a European vegetation-plot database, and compile statistically-derived characteristic species combinations and distribution maps for these habitats.Location:Europe.Methods: We developed the classification expert system EUNIS-ESy, which contains definitions of individual EUNIS habitats based on their species composition and geographic location. Each habitat was formally defined as a formula in a computer language combining algebraic and set-theoretic concepts with formal logical operators. We applied this expert system to classify ,, vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) and other databases. Then we determined diagnostic, constant and dominant species for each habitat by calculating species-to-habitat fidelity and constancy (occurrence frequency) in the classified data set. Finally, we mapped the plot locations for each habitat.Results: Formal definitions were developed for  habitats at Level  of the EUNIS hierarchy, including  coastal,  wetland,  grassland,  shrubland,  forest and  man-made habitats. The expert system classified ,, vegetation plots to these habitat groups and , to other habitats, while , plots remained unclassified or were classified to more than one habitat. Data on each habitat were summarized in factsheets containing habitat description, distribution map, corresponding syntaxa and characteristic species combination.Conclusions: EUNIS habitats were characterized for the first time in terms of their species composition and distribution, based on a classification of a European database of vegetation plots using the newly developed electronic expert system EUNISESy. The data provided and the expert system have considerable potential for future use in European nature conservation planning, monitoring and assessment.","doc_id":1242,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14036","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"'Tutto nero nero' : zur Frage der Abgrenzung zwischen Art. 97 Abs. 1 und Art. 197 Abs. 1 OR anhand ausgewählter Beispiele von Willi Fischer","authors":"Böhme, Anna; Gähwiler, Fabian","subject":"Haftpflichtrecht; Schuldrecht; Gewährleistung; Vertragshaftung;  Privatrecht (CH)","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"346","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"\"Tutto nero nero\" : zur Frage der Abgrenzung zwischen Art.

Several goals are achieved simultaneously: production of valuable goods (food stuff, animal feeds, raw materials, ornamental plants and animals) on one side, and production of utilizable gray water (wastewater purification and hygienisation) on the other side. The main potential of wastewater-fed aquaculture and its major advantage over conventional wastewater treatment is the large diversity of marketable products and therefore broad possibilities of income generation. The combination of the two income generating options (wastewater treatment and biomass production) is a very interesting feature and in addition complies to several global political programs (like Agenda ). Aquaculture is facing challenges. Optimal stocking depends on biogeographical conditions (which species grow where, under what circumstances), cultural acceptance (which products are suitable and marketable) and economical conditions. Among factors limiting the potential and performance of aquaculture are: limited growth rates of organisms, insufficient knowledge of the factors that regulate the aquatic community, the presence of toxic contaminants (heavy metals, hormones) and other undesired effects (colorations) in the wastewater. Appropriate technological tools (aeration, mixing, pumping, special basin forms) can be integrated in order to intensify certain ecological processes and increase the output of the aquaculture plant. At the University of Applied Sciences Wädenswil, Switzerland, wastewater-fed aquaculture is a research focus since . This paper summarises some of the results and insights gained during the past seven years and gives a short overview of literature.","doc_id":1268,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"4","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2317","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The Otelfingen aquaculture project : recycling of nutrients from waste water in a temperate climate","authors":"Staudenmann, Jürg; Junge-Berberović, Ranka","subject":"Pilot plant; Wastewater-fed aquaculture; Ornamental plants; Nutrient elimination;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2003","for_data_analysis":"The Otelfingen aquaculture project : recycling of nutrients from waste water in a temperate climate; Pilot plant; Wastewater-fed aquaculture; Ornamental plants; Nutrient elimination;  Landwirtschaft; A wastewater-fed, partly indoor aquaculture plant ( basins,  m and  m in total) was designed in Otelfingen/Zurich, Switzerland. It was charged with the effluent from a methanization plant processing organic household waste and started operation in spring . The aim of the successive arrangement of the different modules and steps was to efficiently recycle water-borne nutrients in the form of aquatic biomass products, such as floating (ornamental) macrophytes, fish, zoo- and phytoplankton, suitable for selling on the Swiss market. Besides treating the effluent (total organic carbon [TOC], total nitrogen, nitrate [NO-N], ammonium [NH-N], and total phosphorus concentrations being  g/m,  g/m,  g/m,  g/m, and  g/m, respectively) according to Swiss law requirements, the research focused on the search for suitable aquatic organisms and their testing at different environmental conditions. During the -week experimental period, a total of , kg fresh weight (FW) ofbiomass (% as floatingmacrophytes) was harvested. This way,  g/week nitrogen and  g/week phosphorus were eliminated by assimilation, corresponding to -% of the system's inflow. Due to relatively high evapotranspiration rates (on average . mm/week) and for water reconditioning purpose in the fish stocking basins, fresh water was added. Nevertheless, the system's final effluent was very low (% of total inflow plus rainfall) and was carrying only about % and .% of the input loads of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. Hence, the elimination rate was significantly above the average performance of a conventional system normally applied in Middle Europe, although the concentration values of most parameters in the outflow were comparable. Macrophyte production (and thus nutrient assimilation) was close to theoretical maxima in basins with high nutrient levels. Both plankton and fish growth were, at their best, only moderately satisfying. The semi-continual planktonic microalgae culture, and therefore also zooplankton culture, could be improved if the light absorbing humic substances were removed in a pre-treatment. Under given conditions (i.e., temperate climate) fish would rather play an accompanying role in the ecological production process. A wastewater-fed aquaculture facility resembles an integrated production plant rather than a wastewater disposal site. In addition to that, it has potential to prove advantageous over the highly developed conventional wastewater treatment plants established in Middle Europe. Further research in this field is essential and also recommended, considering political programs like Agenda , which contemplate the need for sustainable strategies for handling resources.","doc_id":1306,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"2","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11664","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"New data of the spider fauna (Araneae) of Navarre, Spain : results from the 7th EDGG field workshop","authors":"Polchaninova, Nina; García-Mijangos, Itziar; Berastegi, Asun; Dengler, Jürgen; Biurrun, Idoia","subject":"Spider; Dry grassland;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333, 590","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"New data of the spider fauna (Araneae) of Navarre, Spain : results from the th EDGG field workshop; Spider; Dry grassland;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie); Multi-taxon investigations are of a great importance in biodiversity research.

Eine nachhaltige Bewirtschaftung der Gewässer spielt eine bedeutende Rolle, um die Erhaltung dieser Art zu gewährleisten. Die Dorfbäche in Küsnacht, Erlenbach, Meilen und Feldbach werden seit Jahren mit Nachkommen des Muttertierstamms aus der Fischzucht Stäfa besetzt, jedoch liegen noch keine genetische Erfolgskontrollen vor.Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die populationsgenetische Untersuchung der Art Salmo trutta in diesen Zürichsee-Zuflüssen, um den Erfolg der bisherigen Besatzmassnahmen zu untersuchen. Dabei wurden mit  Mikrosatelliten-Loci die genetischen Unterschiede und die genetische Vielfalt zwischen und innerhalb der Populationen analysiert. Hoch signifikante (p < .) genetische Unterschiede wurden zwischen dem Muttertierstammbesatz und den Individuen in allen Dorfbächen nachgewiesen, was darauf hindeuten könnte, dass zwischen den Besatzfischen und den anderen Populationen aus den Dorfbächen kein freier Genaustausch stattfindet. Weiter war die genetische Variabilität der beprobten Individuen aus den Dorfbächen aufgrund der Allel-Anzahl (AR) höher als im Muttertierstammbesatz, was einen Verlust der genetischen Vielfalt bei den Besatzfischen erklärt. Dadurch ist ihre Fähigkeit, sich an neue Umweltbedingungen anzupassen, stark reduziert. Die genetische Verarmung in der Fischzucht Stäfa konnte ebenso mit einem signifikanten Heterozygotenüberschuss (p < .) nachgewiesen werden. Diese Abweichung des Mutations-Drift-Gleichgewichts wirkt sich nachteilig auf nachkommende Generationen aus, da viele Allele verloren gingen.

At larger areas power laws best represent SARs. Yet, it remains unclear whether SARs follow other shapes at finer spatial grains in continuous vegetation. We asked which function describes SARs best at small grains and explored how sampling methodology or the environment influence SAR shape.Location: Palaearctic grasslands and other non-forested habitats.Taxa: Vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens.Methods: We used the GrassPlot database, containing standardised vegetation-plot data from vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens spanning a wide range of grassland types throughout the Palaearctic and including  nested-plot series with at least seven grain sizes ranging from  cm to  m². Using non-linear regression, we assessed the appropriateness of different SAR functions (power, power quadratic, power breakpoint, logarithmic, Michaelis-Menten). Based on AICc, we tested whether the ranking of functions differed among taxa, methodological settings, biomes or vegetation types.Results: The power function was the most suitable function across the studied taxonomic groups. The superiority of this function increased from lichens to bryophytes to vascular plants to all three taxonomic groups together. The sampling method was highly influential as rooted-presence sampling decreased the performance of the power function. By contrast, biome and vegetation type had practically no influence on the superiority of the power law.Main conclusions: We conclude that SARs of sessile organisms at smaller spatial grains are best approximated by a power function. This coincides with several other comprehensive studies of SARs at different grain sizes and for different taxa, thus supporting the general appropriateness of the power function for modelling species diversity over a wide range of grain sizes. The poor performance of the Michaelis-Menten function demonstrates that richness within plant communities generally does not approach any saturation, thus calling into question the concept of minimal area.","doc_id":1839,"prior":"species diversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8240","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A hospital-wide evaluation of delirium prevalence and outcomes in acute care patients : a cohort study","authors":"Schubert, Maria; Schürch, Roger; Boettger, Soenke; Garcia Nuñez, David; Schwarz, Urs; Bettex, Dominique; Jenewein, Josef; Bogdanovic, Jasmina; Staehli, Marina Lynne; Spirig, Rebecca; Rudiger, Alain","subject":"Cost of diseases OR economic burden of diseases; Delirium; Hospital mortality; Length of stay; Neurocognitive disorder;  Gesundheitsökonomie;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362.1041, 362.11, 616.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"A hospital-wide evaluation of delirium prevalence and outcomes in acute care patients : a cohort study; Cost of diseases OR economic burden of diseases; Delirium; Hospital mortality; Length of stay; Neurocognitive disorder;  Gesundheitsökonomie;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Background: Delirium is a well-known complication in cardiac surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, in many other settings its prevalence and clinical consequences are understudied. The aims of this study were: () To assess delirium prevalence in a large, diverse cohort of acute care patients classified as either at risk or not at risk for delirium; () To compare these two groups according to defined indicators; and () To compare delirious with non-delirious patients regarding hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, nursing hours and cost per case.Methods: This cohort study was performed in a Swiss university hospital following implementation of a delirium management guideline.

It was conducted by the International Ecological Engineering Society in Paris at the conference “Ecological Engineering: from Concepts to Application” organized by the Ecological Engineering Applications Group GAIE. This paper presents the results of the workshop related to three key questions: () what are the benefits of ecological engineering practices to human and ecosystem well-being, () which concepts are used or useful to identify, reference, and measure the benefits of ecological engineering practices, and () how and to whom shall benefits of ecological engineering practices be promoted. While benefits of ecological engineering practices are diverse, general conclusions can be derived to facilitate communication. Identifying benefits requires valuation frameworks reaching beyond the scope of ecology and engineering. A distinction between human and ecosystem well-being in this regard may not be easy or useful, but instead humans embedded in ecosystems should be addressed as a whole. The concepts of resource efficiency, ecosystem services, ecosystem health, and multifunctional land use could serve as suitable references to frame ecological engineering benefits, as well as referring to international political goals such as biodiversity protection, climate change mitigation and poverty reduction.

Particularly, it is generally expected that trees will not be able to adapt or migrate quickly enough in response to the expected climate change without human help. The topic is, however, controversially discussed, because introducing foreign species to an ecosystem can also have disadvantages, such as displacement of native species, especially when a species becomes invasive. Hybridization between introduced and native plant species is one important factor in the evaluation of invasive plants and can be a threat to biodiversity. European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is one of the economically most important broadleaved trees in Europe and is expected to experience a major shift in its natural area as a consequence of climate change. Therefore, its close relative F. orientalis (Fagus orientalis) has been proposed as an alternative for the future. But it has to be taken into consideration that these two species are known to hybridize in their contact zone in Eastern Europe.; Unterstützte Migration - die Bewegung von Arten und Populationen zur Erleichterung der natürlichen Arealausdehnung - hat in letzter Zeit angesichts des Klimawandels grosse Aufmerksamkeit erregt, da es als Instrument zur Verringerung vieler Bedrohungen für Ökosysteme und Arten dienen könnte. Es wird insbesondere erwartet, dass sich Bäume nicht schnell genug anpassen oder migrieren können, um ohne menschliche Hilfe auf den erwarteten Klimawandel zu reagieren. Das Thema wird jedoch kontrovers diskutiert, da die Einführung fremder Arten in ein Ökosystem auch Nachteile mit sich bringen kann. Zum Beispiel die Verdrängung einheimischer Arten, welche insbesondere wenn eine Art invasiv wird auftritt. Die Hybridisierung zwischen fremden und einheimischen Pflanzenarten ist ein wichtiger Faktor bei der Bewertung invasiver Pflanzen und kann eine Bedrohung für die Biodiversität darstellen. Die Rotbuche (Fagus sylvatica) ist einer der wirtschaftlich bedeutendsten Laubbäume Europas und wird voraussichtlich durch den Klimawandel eine starke Veränderung ihres natürlichen Areals erfahren. Daher wurde die nahe verwandte Orientbuche (Fagus orientalis) als Alternative für die Zukunft vorgeschlagen. Dabei ist jedoch zu berücksichtigen, dass diese beiden Arten in ihrer Kontaktzone in Osteuropa bekanntlich hybridisieren.","doc_id":1990,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11278","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Kleinräumige Habitatnutzung des Auerhuhns Tetrao urogallus im Alpenraum","authors":"Bollmann, Kurt; Friedrich, Andrea; Fritsche, Beat; Graf, Roland Felix; Imhof, Stefan; Weibel, Patrick","subject":" Ökologie;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577, 590","year":"2008","for_data_analysis":"Kleinräumige Habitatnutzung des Auerhuhns Tetrao urogallus im Alpenraum;  Ökologie;  Tiere (Zoologie); The Western Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus occupies a broad fundamental ecological niche as long as some criteria are fulfilled regarding structural characteristics of forest stands. We studied these characteristics at the small scale in forest ecosystems that differed in landscape characteristics, tree species composition and ground vegetation. The studies were performed in the Prealps and Central Alps of Switzerland, respectively. Forest stand characteristics were assessed with a set of variables that describe the composition and structure of tree, shrub and ground vegetation and the number and type of forest gaps and edge elements. Logistic regression was used to compare study plots of used areas versus available habitat for Capercaillie in winter and/or summer. Intermediate canopy cover in combination with a good abundance of forest aisles and a minimal amount of basal-branched single trees were the most important predictors of habitat choice of Capercaillie at the scale of a forest stand, independent of the study area. From the edge variables, free-standing, basal-branched trees of Norway spruce Picea abies were the preferred hiding elements for resting Capercaillie. The type and composition of ground vegetation showed distinct differences among the study areas. Surprisingly, the proportion of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus cover was not a significant predictor in the analyses.

Das Projekt zielte auf Förderung und Erhaltung der sexuellen und reproduktiven Gesundheit von jungen Frauen in der Deutschschweiz. Hierbei handelt es sich um ein originelles Konzept, dessen Grundidee es war, jugendgerechte Informationsbroschüren kombiniert mit Beilagen (Kondom, Kleber, Kaugummi) in einem Kosmetiktäschchen abzugeben und gleichzeitig die Beratungsqualität zu verbessern.Methode: Die Meinung sowohl junger Nécessaire-Empfängerinnen (n = ) als auch von Fachpersonen (n = ), die mit Nécessaires gearbeitet haben, wurde mittels halbstrukturierter Fragebogen erhoben. Das Monitoring der Bestellungen während  Monaten (n = ) vermittelte einen Eindruck über die Verwendung des Produkts durch verschiedene Institutionen.Ergebnisse: Junge Mädchen beurteilen das Produkt äußerst positiv. Geschätzt wird v. a. die Broschüre „Rosa zwischen Lust und Frust”, die im Stile eines kommentierten Tagebuchs die Leserinnen sehr anspricht. Kritisch angemerkt wird, dass grundsätzlich junge Männer auch vermehrt auf ihre Verantwortung im Zusammenhang mit Kontrazeption, HIV-Prävention und Partnerschaft sensibilisiert werden sollen. Die befragten Fachpersonen, die mit einem Nécessaire gearbeitet haben, möchten generell das Nécessaire auch weiterhin in ihrer Berufstätigkeit einsetzen. Gewünscht wird Umsetzungshilfe für den praktischen Einsatz des Nécessaires im Berufsalltag. Zudem werden ähnliche Produkte für die Arbeit mit jungen Männern und Migrantinnen gefordert. Das Monitoring des Bestellwesens zeigt, dass sich vor allem Schulen und Institutionen der nichtschulischen Jugendarbeit für das Produkt interessierten. Von ärztlichen Praxen und Beratungsstellen - für die das Projekt auf Grund einer vorgängigen Bedarfsabklärung hauptsächlich entworfen wurde - gingen verhältnismäßig wenig Bestellungen ein.Schlussfolgerungen: Das Nécessaire genießt generell eine hohe Akzeptanz. Die Wissensvermittlung und die Unterstützung von jungen Frauen in der Umsetzung HIV-präventiver Maßnahmen ist dem Projekt „Nécessaire” gelungen. Als Hilfsmittel für die individuelle Beratung von jungen Frauen - insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit der HIV-Prävention - wurde das Produkt nicht im erwünschten Maße eingesetzt.

In Zukunft sollte der praktische Einsatz durch zielgerichtete Maßnahmen wie Begleitmaterialien und Anwendungstraining gefördert werden. Bei der Entwicklung eines ähnlichen Projekts für junge Männer resp. Migrantinnen muss das Konzept an die Lebenswelt der jeweiligen Zielgruppe angepasst werden.; Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the innovative project \"Nécessaire” on sexual and reproductive health promotion. \"Nécessaire” was developed for young women and carried out in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The concept consisted of giving theoretical information in a brochure suitable for young women in its design combined with several items (such as condom, chewing gum, sticker) in a spongebag.Method: Young women (n = ) as well as professionals (n = ) were asked to give their opinion on the \"Necessaire” by filling in a semi-structured questionnaire. In addition, the product ordering was monitored over  months, in order to examine the use of the product by various institutions.Results: On the whole, the young women praised the product. They especially liked the brochure, which was made up like a diary written by a young woman called Rosa. According to their answers the combination of information and useful items stimulated the reflection on topics like sexuality, love, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. Critical voices pointed out the need for interventions aimed at young men, in order to make them more aware of their responsibility in contraception, HIV prevention and partnerships. The professionals generally would like to continue using the product in their work with young women. Many of them asked for more accompanying material with practical ideas for using the product. A similar product for young men and foreign youngsters was often asked for. The monitoring of the product ordering showed that schools and institutions such as youth centres evinced the greatest interest in the product. This contrasted with the results of a feasibility study conducted in advance. Although medical and advice centres indicated a need for a product to support professionals counselling young women, these institutions ordered relatively few kits.Conclusion: Generally speaking the \"Nécessaire” was well received by young women as well as by professionals. It not only informs on sexual health but also promotes preventive behaviour in daily life. The product was not used as an aid for counselling young women as much as was intended. It is suggested to promote the Nécessaire’s use by taking specific measures like developing written material with practical ideas for professionals. In the case of developing a similar product for young men and migrants, their specific backgrounds and cultures should be taken into account and the material adapted accordingly.","doc_id":2262,"prior":"Erhaltung","sdg14":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1123","date":"2016","language":"de","title":"Der Einfluss von perioperativer Angst auf den Genesungsprozess","authors":"Imhof, Bettina","subject":"Perioperative; Anxiety; Recovery; Nursing intervention;  Pflege","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610.73","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Der Einfluss von perioperativer Angst auf den Genesungsprozess; Perioperative; Anxiety; Recovery; Nursing intervention;  Pflege; Hintergrund: Bei % der Patientinnen und Patienten, welche in ein Schweizer Spital eintreten wird eine Operation durchgeführt (BfS, ).

In the main part of this talk the implementation of new method to study the transport phenomena under specific geometrical constraints is shown. The local reactive flow in an industrial domain of special geometry still is an important topic in numerical simulation. For example, the problem of high aspect ratio between length and thickness of the thin layer requires a smooth mesh generation to avoid the badly conditioning system resulting from stretched element. The classical solution of convective dominant transport is usually stabilized by an added numerical diffusion which lead to an inaccurate representation of the boundary layer. The nonlinear conservation system is usually solved by means of linearization methods like Newton Raphson which is not always efficient in the case of badly conditioning problems. In SOFC fuel cell applications, unlike conventional methods, ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) numerical scheme allows one to predict local gradients of chemical species and electrical charges with low computing costs and unconditional numerical stability. This is especially important in the vicinity of a current collector rib and under extreme operation conditions, e.g. when the fuel gets depleted. Furthermore, the convection dominant transport within the gas distribution channels has been accurately calculated without using an additional transversal (artificial) numerical diffusion.

Four different freshwater perturbations are applied to the North Atlantic between °N and °N leading to a substantial weakening of MOC and an expansion of winter sea ice cover over the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Seas. Deactivating the freshwater forcing leads to a two-phase recovery of the MOC. The first phase is a slow basin-wide advection process whereas the second phase is an abrupt, decadal-scale transition, located in the North Atlantic. The slow basin-wide advection process to an intermediate state of the MOC is characterized by a restart of the deep water production in the area of the subpolar gyre and the Irminger Basin. However, the ice cover over the GIN Seas remains, whereas the surface density gradually increases in the GIN Seas on a century time scale. The length of this intermediate state depends on the strength of freshwater perturbation, which determines the magnitude of the meridional density gradient in the North Atlantic. The second transition phase is triggered by a model-specific density threshold reached in the GIN Seas. When passed, the MOC abruptly intensifies by ∼% within - years. The analysis shows that this abrupt intensification only depends on surface salinity in the GIN Seas. The model results reveal that the simulated sea ice retreat in the GIN Seas and a rapid increase of the Greenland air temperature of the second phase of the resumption of the MOC are similar in amplitude to temperature proxies observed during Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the last ice age.","doc_id":2429,"prior":"sea","sdg14":1},{"id":"7","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6793","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Raumnutzung des Libellen-Schmetterlingshafts nördlich der Alpen : Folgerungen für den Artenschutz","authors":"Müller, Markus; Krüsi, Bertil; Schlegel, Jürg","subject":" Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333, 590","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Raumnutzung des Libellen-Schmetterlingshafts nördlich der Alpen : Folgerungen für den Artenschutz;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie); Spatial Use of the Owly Sulphur north of the Alps – Consequences for species protection Isolation of habitats remains one of the most severe threats to biodiversity, and it is vital to enable exchange among habitat islands by creating suitable stepping stones or connecting habitat corridors.

The study investigated flying habits of this protected species in order to elucidate both its core habitat and adjacent areas used for hunting and mating, with special regard to obstacles. The results revealed that wind protection seems to be one of the prime requirements for L. coccajus, whereas land use and thus vegetation type play a minor role, at least as far as hunting is concerned. For instance, L. coccajus was frequently observed to fly and hunt above corn fields and other crops.

Due to high effluent concentrations on one hand (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentrations being , , and  mg l−, respectively) and stringent wastewater regulations on the other hand, the aquaculture was split into modules and stocked with organisms of different environmental requirements. The modular structure, as opposed to traditional one-pond polyculture, allowed manipulation and better nutrient budgeting of the system. Research focused on nutrient-recycling efficiency of a wide array of modules, producing biomass such as algae, fish, zooplankton, and aquatic macrophytes as ornamental plants (Eichhornia, Pistia, Ipomoea, Lemna, Azolla) which were suitable for sale on the Swiss market. Different arrangements of modules, of water and wastewater flows and of nutrient concentrations were tested in  years, -. Our research showed that aquaculture can be set up to either produce treated wastewater ready for discharge into surface waters or to maximize nutrient recycling through biomass production. In the first case, the recommended loadings are below . g N m− day− and . g P m− day−, in the latter . g N m− day− and . g P m− day− still resulted in a % removal of nitrogen and % removal of phosphorus.

Aquaponics can promote scientific literacy and provide a useful tool for teaching the natural sciences at all levels, from primary through to tertiary education. An aquaponics classroom model system can provide multiple ways of enriching classes in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and the day-to-day maintenance of an aquaponics can also enable experiential learning. Aquaponics can thus become an enjoyable and effective way for learners to study STEM content, and can also be used for teaching subjects such as business and economics, and for addressing issues like sustainable development, environmental science, agriculture, food systems, and health.

Bacterial evolution in HCH-contaminated soils resulted in the development of several Spingomonadaceae which express a series of HCH-converting enzymes. We showed that LinB, a haloalkane dehalogenase from Sphingobium indicum BA, also transforms various HBCDs besides HCHs. Here we present evidence that LinA, another dehalogenase from S. indicum also converts certain HBCDs to pentabromocyclododecenes (PBCDEs). Racemic mixtures of α-, β-, γ-HBCDs, a mixture of them, and δ-HBCD, a meso form, were exposed to LinA. Substantial conversion of (-)β-HBCD was observed, but all other stereoisomers were not transformed significantly. The enantiomeric excess (EE) of β-HBCDs increased up to % in  h, whereas EE values of α- and γ-HBCDs were not affected. Substrate conversion and product formation were described with second-order kinetic models. One major (Pβ) and possibly two minor (Pβ, Pβ) metabolites were detected. Respective mass spectra showed the characteristic isotope pattern of PBCDEs, the HBr elimination products of HBCDs. Michaelis-Menten parameters KM=. ± . μM and vmax=. ± . μmoll(-)h(-) were deduced from exposure data with varying enzyme/substrate ratios. LinA is more substrate specific than LinB, the latter converted all tested HBCDs, LinA only one. The widespread HCH pollution favored the selection and evolution of bacteria converting these compounds. We found that LinA and LinB, two of these HCH-converting enzymes expressed in S. indicum BA, also dehalogenate HBCDs to lower brominated compounds, indicating that structural similarities of both classes of compounds are recognized at the level of substrate-protein interactions.","doc_id":2791,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19840","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Stream biofilm response to an increasing number of non-flow periods","authors":"Etter, Ariane; Fischer, Selina","subject":"Intermittent waterways; Intermittency; Non-flow period; Artificial streams; Stream biofilm; Frequency; Duration; Impact; Recovery; Autotrophic and heterotrophic activities; Function; Biomass;  Biologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"570","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Stream biofilm response to an increasing number of non-flow periods; Intermittent waterways; Intermittency; Non-flow period; Artificial streams; Stream biofilm; Frequency; Duration; Impact; Recovery; Autotrophic and heterotrophic activities; Function; Biomass;  Biologie; Anthropogenic impacts and climate change are considerably altering freshwater systems. Most significant consequences of this are changes to flow regimes as well as the transformation of permanent into temporary waterways. This is problematic, as despite their role in supporting biodiversity and ecosystem processes, temporary waterways are undervalued and poorly understood. In fact, although the effects of non-flow periods are known, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how changes in frequency and duration of non-flow periods influence temporary waterways. Therefore, the goal of further research is to extend the current knowledge surrounding the effects of temporal components on the aquatic ecosystem. This bachelor thesis aims to identify how the frequency of non-flow periods affects autotrophic and heterotrophic stream biofilm. With this objective, an experiment at the Experimental Stream Facility of Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA) was performed. The treatments consisted of one drought duration ( days) and three frequencies ( period of ,  periods of ,  periods of  non-flow days). The development of the autotrophic and heterotrophic stream biofilm was measured during flow periods by means of yield of photochemistry, aerobic respiration, ecosystem metabolism and ash free dry mass. The hypotheses were that with increasing frequency, the effects on stream biofilm are less because the number of subsequent non-flow days is smaller and thus the biofilm is less stressed, and that autotrophs in the epipsammic biofilm recover more slowly than in the epilithic biofilm, because the amount of water retained in sand is higher. Both hypotheses were partially confirmed, as an increasing frequency only lessened the effect on epipsammic biofilm and only autotrophic function recovered more slowly in sand than on cobbles. In addition, the majority of the variables experienced the most severe impact and thus the quickest recovery in the same treatment. Nevertheless, at the end of the experiment none of the differences persisted. Therefore, the frequency of non-flow periods only had an effect on a short-term but not on a long-term scale and consequently, both hypotheses were discarded.","doc_id":2794,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10310","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Establishment of vegetation (local dry meadows) on flat roofs and creation of habitat for ground nesting Birds","authors":"Baumann, Nathalie","subject":"Urban biodiversity; Ground nesting bird; Breeding success; Ecological compensation; Biodivers roofs; Hey mulch technique;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"333, 577","year":"2008","for_data_analysis":"Establishment of vegetation (local dry meadows) on flat roofs and creation of habitat for ground nesting Birds; Urban biodiversity; Ground nesting bird; Breeding success; Ecological compensation; Biodivers roofs; Hey mulch technique;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie","doc_id":2815,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24557","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Distribution maps of vegetation alliances in Europe","authors":"Preislerová, Zdenka; Jiménez‐Alfaro, Borja; Mucina, Ladislav; Berg, Christian; Bonari, Gianmaria; Kuzemko, Anna; Landucci, Flavia; Marcenò, Corrado; Monteiro‐Henriques, Tiago; Novák, Pavel; Vynokurov, Denys; Bergmeier, Erwin; Dengler, Jürgen; Apostolova, Iva; Bioret, Frederic; Biurrun, Idoia; Campos, Juan Antonio; Capelo, Jorge; Čarni, Andraž; Çoban, Süleyman; Csiky, János; Ćuk, Mirjana; Ćušterevska, Renata; Daniëls, Fred J.A.; De Sanctis, Michele; Didukh, Yakiv; Dítě, Daniel; Fanelli, Giuliano; Golovanov, Yaroslav; Golub, Valentin; Guarino, Riccardo; Hájek, Michal; Iakushenko, Dmytro; Indreica, Adrian; Jansen, Florian; Jašková, Anni; Jiroušek, Martin; Kalníková, Veronika; Kavgacı, Ali; Kucherov, Ilya; Küzmič, Filip; Lebedeva, Maria; Loidi, Javier; Lososová, Zdeňka; Lysenko, Tatiana; Milanović, Đorđije; Onyshchenko, Viktor; Perrin, Gwenhael; Peterka, Tomáš; Rašomavičius, Valerijus; Rodríguez‐Rojo, María Pilar; Rodwell, John S.; Rūsiņa, Solvita; Sánchez‐Mata, Daniel; Schaminée, Joop H.J.; Semenishchenkov, Yuri; Shevchenko, Nikolay; Šibík, Jozef; Škvorc, Željko; Smagin, Viktor; Stešević, Danijela; Stupar, Vladimir; Šumberová, Kateřina; Theurillat, Jean‐Paul; Tikhonova, Elena; Tzonev, Rossen; Valachovič, Milan; Vassilev, Kiril; Willner, Wolfgang; Yamalov, Sergey; Večeřa, Martin; Chytrý, Milan","subject":"Alliance; Distribution; Europe; EuroVegChecklist; Map; Phytosociology; Syntaxon; Vegetation survey; Vegetation type;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"580","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Distribution maps of vegetation alliances in Europe; Alliance; Distribution; Europe; EuroVegChecklist; Map; Phytosociology; Syntaxon; Vegetation survey; Vegetation type;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Aim: The first comprehensive checklist of European phytosociological alliances, orders and classes (EuroVegChecklist) was published by Mucina et al.

Here we provide the first maps of all alliances in Europe.Location: Europe, Greenland, Canary Islands, Madeira, Azores, Cyprus and the Caucasus countries.Methods: We collected data on the occurrence of phytosociological alliances in European countries and regions from literature and vegetation-plot databases. We interpreted and complemented these data using the expert knowledge of an international team of vegetation scientists and matched all the previously reported alliance names and concepts with those of the EuroVegChecklist. We then mapped the occurrence of the EuroVegChecklist alliances in  territorial units corresponding to countries, large islands, archipelagos and peninsulas. We subdivided the mainland parts of large or biogeographically heterogeneous countries based on the European biogeographical regions. Specialized alliances of coastal habitats were mapped only for the coastal section of each territorial unit.Results: Distribution maps were prepared for , alliances of vascular-plant dominated vegetation reported in the EuroVegChecklist. For each territorial unit, three levels of occurrence probability were plotted on the maps: (a) verified occurrence; (b) uncertain occurrence; and (c) absence. The maps of individual alliances were complemented by summary maps of the number of alliances and the alliance–area relationship. Distribution data are also provided in a spreadsheet.Conclusions: The new map series represents the first attempt to characterize the distribution of all vegetation types at the alliance level across Europe. There are still many knowledge gaps, partly due to a lack of data for some regions and partly due to uncertainties in the definition of some alliances. The maps presented here provide a basis for future research aimed at filling these gaps.","doc_id":2818,"prior":"coastal habitats","sdg14":1},{"id":"91","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13086","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Closing the loop on poop","authors":"Sommer, Sarah","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"363","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Closing the loop on poop;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Closing the nutrient cycle is essential to longer space journeys.

While these aggregates do not impact the already short lifetime of dissolved iron, they impede the citrate-favored homogeneous process that mainly inactivates E. coli.

Mehrere Studien haben gezeigt, dass die Diversifizierung der Nutzpflanzen die Klimaresilienz der landwirtschaftlichen Systeme verbessern, den Einsatz von Pestiziden reduzieren und die Biodiversität fördern kann. Immer mehr Verbraucher werden sich dieser Problematik bewusst und bevorzugen lokal produzierte Produkte aus biologischer Landwirtschaft. In der vorliegenden Arbeit stellen wir einen effizienten Ablauf zur Identifizierung neuer Kulturpflanzen auf Basis der öffentlich zugänglichen Datenbanken EcoCrop und FAOSTAT der Food and Agriculture Organization der Vereinten Nationen vor und wenden ihn auf die Schweiz an. Um neue Kulturen zu identifizieren, vergleicht die Proximity Analyse die Schweizer Agrarproduktion mit der Produktion anderer Länder. Die EcoCrop-Alternative Analyse nutzt die Wachstumsbedingungen zur Identifikation neuer Kulturen. Zudem haben wir durch Interviews mit Interessenvertretern entlang der Nutzpflanzen-Wertschöpfungskette Kriterien entwickelt, welche die neuen Kulturen erfüllen müssen, um in der Schweiz erfolgreich angebaut werden zu können. Diese Kriterien umfassen eine breite Palette von Themen, die von der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion über die unterstützende Infrastruktur bis hin zu kommerziellen Kriterien reichen und wurden dann zur Bewertung der neuen Kulturen herangezogen. Diese Bewertung ergab, dass die Proximity Analyse und die EcoCrop-Alternative Analyse zur Identifizierung potenzieller neuer Kulturen für sehr unterschiedliche Anwendungen führten, von Getreide über Gemüse bis zu Obstbäumen, von denen einige nur für Nischenmärkte relevant sind und andere ein Potenzial für den Anbau in grösserem Umfang haben. Während die Proximity Analyse eine Tendenz zu Kulturen mit höherem wirtschaftlichem Potenzial aufweist, entdeckte die EcoCrop-Alternative Analyse zum Teil eher exotische Pflanzen, die sich allenfalls für Nischenmärkte eignen. Zusammenfassend liefern die beiden Ansätze zur Identifizierung von Nutzpflanzen sich ergänzende Listen neuer Pflanzen, die dann anhand der durch die Interviews definierten Kriterien weiter analysiert werden können. Da die verwendeten Datenbanken öffentlich zugänglich sind, kann der vorgestellte Arbeitsablauf global angewendet werden und möglicherweise eine Rolle bei der Diversifizierung der Landwirtschaft spielen und diese an die Herausforderungen des Klimawandels anpassen.; Globally, agriculture has to diversify to adapt to climate change. Many studies have shown that crop diversification can improve climate resilience of agricultural systems, reduce pesticide application and promote biodiversity. Increasingly, consumers are more aware of these issues and favor products produced locally from organic agriculture. Here, we present an efficient workflow for identifying new crops based on the publicly available databases, EcoCrop and FAOSTAT of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and apply it to Switzerland. To identify new crops, the Proximity Analysis compares Swiss agricultural production with national production data of other countries. The EcoCrop Alternative Analysis uses conditions for growth as a tool for identification of new crops. Furthermore, through interviews with stakeholders along the crop value chain, we developed criteria which the new crops have to fulfill in order to be successfully cultivated in Switzerland. These criteria span a wide range of topics from agricultural production to supporting infrastructure and commercial criteria, and were then used to assess the new crops. This assessment indicated that the Proximity Analysis and the EcoCrop Alternative Analysis resulted in the identification of potential new crops for very varying uses, from cereals to vegetables and fruit trees, some only relevant for niche markets and others with the potential of being cultivated on a larger scale. While the Proximity Analysis has a bias toward crops with a higher economic potential, the EcoCrop Alternative Analysis discovered more exotic plants suited for niche markets. Taken together, the two approaches for crop identification deliver complementing lists of new crops that can then be further analyzed using the criteria defined through the interviews. Since the databases used are public, the presented workflow can be applied globally and may be able to play a role in diversifying agriculture, adapting it to the challenges presented by a changing climate.","doc_id":3291,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17817","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The global impacts of extreme sea-level rise : a comprehensive economic assessment","authors":"Pycroft, Jonathan; Abrell, Jan; Ciscar, Juan-Carlos","subject":"Climate change; Impact assessment; Sea-level rise; Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"The global impacts of extreme sea-level rise : a comprehensive economic assessment; Climate change; Impact assessment; Sea-level rise; Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; This paper investigates the world-wide economic cost of rapid sea-level rise of the kind that could be caused by accelerated ice flow from the West Antarctic and/or the Greenland ice sheets.

Kurgans are small, but numerous objects resembling “islands” in “the sea” of arable land. We asked: i) how strongly does vascular plant species richness on kurgans depend on their size and does this relationship differ between steppe specialists and generalist species? ii) Which other factors influence vascular plant species richness on kurgans?Location: Southern Ukraine.Methods: We recorded species lists and environmental conditions of  kurgans. With non-linear regression we analyzed species-area relationships (SARs) for all species and steppe and generalists species separately. Then, we assessed importance of other factors in explaining the residuals of the SAR models using simultaneous autoregressive models and multimodel inference.Results: Kurgan area had strong influence on species richness of all groups of species, but particularly on richness of steppe specialists. The estimates of slope of the power function (z-values) in the models for total species richness were high for total species richness (.), but even higher for steppe species (.) and lower for generalist species (.). For total species richness and steppe species, the most important predictors in addition to area were steepness of the kurgan (positive), distance to steppe enclave (negative) and precipitation of the warm period (negative). For steppe species also habitat amount index (positive) and the disturbance (negative) were important predictors. For generalist species, the only important predictors were land use in the surrounding (lower when only arable fields) and steepness of a kurgan (positive).Main conclusions: Our results indicate that kurgans are habitat islands only for steppe habitat specialists. For this group of species, area and isolation are important predictors of species richness, what is in accordance with the theory of island biogeography, while also local factors play a role.","doc_id":3749,"prior":"sea","sdg14":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11925","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"“Primeval forest relict beetles” of Central Europe : a set of 168 umbrella species for the protection of primeval forest remnants","authors":"Eckelt, Andreas; Müller, Jörg; Bense, Ulrich; Brustel, Hervé; Bußler, Heinz; Chittaro, Yannick; Cizek, Lukas; Frei, Adrienne; Holzer, Erwin; Kadej, Marcin; Kahlen, Manfred; Köhler, Frank; Möller, Georg; Mühle, Hans; Sanchez, Andreas; Schaffrath, Ulrich; Schmidl, Jürgen; Smolis, Adrian; Szallies, Alexander; Németh, Tamás; Wurst, Claus; Thorn, Simon; Christensen, Rune Haubo Bojesen; Seibold, Sebastian","subject":"Saproxylic beetles; Old growth; Primeval forest relicts; Habitat continuity; Megatree continuity; Forest conservation; Flagship species; Umbrella species;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"590","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"“Primeval forest relict beetles” of Central Europe : a set of  umbrella species for the protection of primeval forest remnants; Saproxylic beetles; Old growth; Primeval forest relicts; Habitat continuity; Megatree continuity; Forest conservation; Flagship species; Umbrella species;  Tiere (Zoologie); Identification of forest stands with priority for the conservation of biodiversity is of particular importance in landscapes with a long cultural and agricultural history, such as Central Europe.

Looking forward, the use of plastic degrading enzymes may facilitate sustainable plastic waste management and become an important tool for the realization of a circular plastic economy.","doc_id":4040,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12197","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Establishing criteria for human mesenchymal stem cell potency","authors":"Samsonraj, Rebekah M.; Rai, Bina; Sathiyanathan, Padmapriya; Puan, Kia Joo; Rötzschke, Olaf; Hui, James H.; Raghunath, Michael; Stanton, Lawrence W.; Nurcombe, Victor; Cool, Simon M.","subject":" Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Establishing criteria for human mesenchymal stem cell potency;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; This study sought to identify critical determinants of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) potency using in vitro and in vivo attributes of cells isolated from the bone marrow of age‐ and sex‐matched donors. Adherence to plastic was not indicative of potency, yet capacity for long‐term expansion in vitro varied considerably between donors, allowing the grouping of MSCs from the donors into either those with high‐growth capacity or low‐growth capacity. Using this grouping strategy, high‐growth capacity MSCs were smaller in size, had greater colony‐forming efficiency, and had longer telomeres. Cell‐surface biomarker analysis revealed that the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) criteria did not distinguish between high‐growth capacity and low‐growth capacity MSCs, whereas STRO‐ and platelet‐derived growth factor receptor alpha were preferentially expressed on high‐growth capacity MSCs. These cells also had the highest mean expression of the mRNA transcripts TWIST‐ and DERMO‐. Irrespective of these differences, both groups of donor MSCs produced similar levels of key growth factors and cytokines involved in tissue regeneration and were capable of multilineage differentiation. However, high‐growth capacity MSCs produced approximately double the volume of mineralized tissue compared to low‐growth capacity MSCs when assessed for ectopic bone‐forming ability. The additional phenotypic criteria presented in this study when combined with the existing ISCT minimum criteria and working proposal will permit an improved assessment of MSC potency and provide a basis for establishing the quality of MSCs prior to their therapeutic application.","doc_id":4100,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22837","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Wiesel-Habitatvernetzung in neuem Licht : ein Ansatz zur Erfassung von Kleinstrukturen mittels LiDAR","authors":"Inauen, Josua","subject":"Fernerkundung; LiDAR; Objekterkennung; Kleinstrukturen; Asthaufen; Wiesel;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Elektro-, Kommunikations-, Steuerungs- und Regelungstechnik","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333.7, 621.3","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Wiesel-Habitatvernetzung in neuem Licht : ein Ansatz zur Erfassung von Kleinstrukturen mittels LiDAR; Fernerkundung; LiDAR; Objekterkennung; Kleinstrukturen; Asthaufen; Wiesel;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Elektro-, Kommunikations-, Steuerungs- und Regelungstechnik; In dieser Arbeit wurde anhand eines Vergleiches eines LiDAR- mit einem Vektor-Referenzdatensatz die Praktikabilität von Laserscanning-Daten für die Erhebung von Kleinstrukturen im Kontext von Wieselförderprojekten eingeschätzt.

A visual comparison was used to determine whether the piles of branches (reference data) captured in the field are present in the LiDAR data set. In addition, a tool for extracting brush piles from a LiDAR data set was developed based on existing models. The tool is based on the calculation of several attributes of terrain models derived from LiDAR data. After the exclusion of irrelevant areas such as settlement areas, roads and water areas, the tool extracts potential piles of branches and outputs them in a vector format using heuristically determined limit values for height, area, slope, exposure diversity and compactness. The results show that LiDAR is well suited for the detection and extraction of small natural structures such as piles of branches. Over % of the reference data points were detectable in the LiDAR data set. The tool achieved a hit rate of about  %. The work provides a well implementable approach for the generation of spatial data of ecological small structures, which are only sparsely available today and could be interesting for different ecological connectivity projects and habitat modelling.","doc_id":4225,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4081","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Some European green roof norms and guidelines through the lens of biodiversity : do ecoregions and plant traits also matter?","authors":"Catalano, Chiara; Laudicina, Vito Armando; Badalucco, Luigi; Guarino, Riccardo","subject":" Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Some European green roof norms and guidelines through the lens of biodiversity : do ecoregions and plant traits also matter?;  Ökologie","doc_id":4255,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"42","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9568","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Behandlungsverfahren in der Ergotherapie : Gestern und Heute","authors":"Roos, Kim Caroline; Aubort, Lucette; Adam, Josef; Küng, Cäcilia","subject":"Behandlung; Geschichte; Ergotherapie; Intervention;  Ergotherapie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"615.8515","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Behandlungsverfahren in der Ergotherapie : Gestern und Heute; Behandlung; Geschichte; Ergotherapie; Intervention;  Ergotherapie; Einleitung: Im Rahmen des Unterrichts zur ergotherapeutischen Geschichte wurden „historische“ Schriftstücke und Behandlungsgegenstände gesucht.

Regional persistence is tightly linked to size, spatial configuration and quality of habitat patches. Hence it is important for the management of endangered species that priority patches can be identified. We developed a predictive model of patch occupancy by capercaillie, a threatened grouse species, based on a single snapshot of data. We used logistic regression to predict patch occupancy as a function of patch size, isolation, connectivity, relative altitude, and biogeographical area. The probability of a patch being occupied increased with patch size and increasing altitude, and decreased with increasing distance to the next occupied patch. Patch size was the most important predictor although occupied patches varied considerably in size. Our model only uses data on the number, size and spatial configuration of habitat patches. It is a useful tool to designate priority areas for conservation, i.e. large core patches with high resilience in habitat quality, smaller island‐patches that still have high probability of being inhabited or becoming recolonised, and patches functioning as “stepping stones”. If capercaillie is to be preserved, habitat suitability needs to be maintained in a functional network of patches that account for size and inter‐patch distance thresholds as found in this study. We suggest that similar area‐isolation relationships are valid for almost any region within the distribution range of capercaillie. The thresholds for occupancy are however likely to depend on characteristics of the respective landscape. The outcome of our study emphasises the need for future investigations that explore the relationship between patch occupancy, matrix quality and its resistance to dispersing individuals.","doc_id":4348,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20760","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Gesunde Führung in KMU : ein Leitfaden für Führungskräfte in Holzbauunternehmen","authors":"Gloor, Judith","subject":"Gesunde Führung; KMU; Holzbau; Leitfaden;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Leitendes Management","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610, 658.4","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Gesunde Führung in KMU : ein Leitfaden für Führungskräfte in Holzbauunternehmen; Gesunde Führung; KMU; Holzbau; Leitfaden;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Leitendes Management; Die Erhaltung der Gesundheit aller Mitarbeitenden ist vor dem Hintergrund des demographischen Wandels wesentlich.

This paper presents an assessment of the local criticality of quarried aggregates by adapting the methodology for metal criticality determination to the characteristics of construction aggregates. Two approaches, strong and weak locality, are envisaged to examine different substitution scenarios in the case of local supply constraint. The adapted methodology examines three dimensions: Supply Risk, Environmental Implications and Vulnerability to Supply Restriction. The application of the methodology to the cantons of Switzerland shows that inside a country, the criticality is driven by the Supply Risk, which depends on the surface and number of quarries and their distribution in the region. A comparison of the supply risk of aggregates with the supply risk of steel shows that for most of the cantons the supply risk of natural aggregates is lower. The application of this methodology at a world scale will indicate highly critical regions and enable policymakers to define measures for ensuring a sustainable growth, either by regulating the extraction of aggregates or by demonstrating the local need to consider the use of other materials, apart from concrete.","doc_id":4515,"prior":"overexploitation","sdg14":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23310","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Reduction of nonvolatile particulate matter emissions of a commercial turbofan engine at the ground level from the use of a sustainable aviation fuel blend","authors":"Durdina, Lukas; Brem, Benjamin Tobias; Elser, Miriam; Schönenberger, David; Siegerist, Frithjof; Anet, Julien","subject":"Aviation emissions; Sustainable aviation fuel; Particulate matter; Black carbon; Air pollution;  Luftfahrt- und Fahrzeugtechnik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"629","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Reduction of nonvolatile particulate matter emissions of a commercial turbofan engine at the ground level from the use of a sustainable aviation fuel blend; Aviation emissions; Sustainable aviation fuel; Particulate matter; Black carbon; Air pollution;  Luftfahrt- und Fahrzeugtechnik; Non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) emissions from aircraft turbine engines deteriorate air quality and contribute to climate change.

The environment is important for economic production in a twofold way: firstly, it supplies resources as inputs for the production process and, secondly, it serves as a sink for all kinds of waste products generated by economic activities. It is shown that in the absence of environmental policy the overexploitation of the renewable resource stock and the dumping of waste will drive nature beyond the limits of its assimilative and regenerative capacity. Therefore, we focus on these phenomena by modelling on the one hand recycling processes that decrease the flow of waste to the environment and considering on the other hand requirements for a sustainable extraction of raw materials. Hence, by including the intention to spare resources and the aim of reducing waste, we deal with an input problem - sometimes referred to as the primary problem - and an output problem - referred to as the secondary problem. Both problems can be considered to have local, regional and global impacts. For example, reduced resource requirements might decrease the dependency of resource-importing countries (local or regional effect) and will also help to maintain the supply of resources in all world regions (global effect). Alternatively consider the example of a reduction in the combustion of waste which is due to an increase in recycling. The reduction will cause the mitigation of local and regional air pollution as well as of global warming causing emissions of CO. Hence, one far-reaching policy additionally induces ancillary benefits on different geographical levels. We use the framework of an endogenous growth model where waste is generated as an undesired byproduct in the production of the desired output. Nature is assumed to have a certain regenerative capability which depends on the state of the environment. Furthermore, environmental quality is negatively affected by the amount of waste dumped and the amount of resources extracted. The amount of dumped waste can be reduced by recycling firms which process the waste and sell it to the intermediate sector where it serves as substitute for natural resources as an input in production. We show that balanced sustainable growth is only possible if governmental policy ensures a recycling rate of unity. By reviewing the debate on complete recycling, we finally discuss this result from an ecological economics point of view. It is shown that the feasibility of complete recycling depends critically on the nature of wastes, a sufficient storing space for wastes and the availability of sufficient energy.","doc_id":4893,"prior":"overexploitation","sdg14":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12703","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Recycling for sustainability - a long-run perspective?","authors":"Kuhn, Thomas; Pittel, Karen; Schulz, Thomas","subject":"Growth; Recycling; Sustainability; Secondary effects;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338.927","year":"2003","for_data_analysis":"Recycling for sustainability - a long-run perspective?; Growth; Recycling; Sustainability; Secondary effects;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; In our paper, we analyse the prospects for sustainable growth offered by recycling promoting environmental policies where the main objective of the government is to assure for sustainability in the sense of a non deteriorating state of the environment.

Hence, by including the intention to spare resources and the aim of reducing waste, we deal with an input problem - sometimes referred to as the primary problem - and an output problem - referred to as the secondary problem. Both problems can be considered to have local, regional and global impacts. For example, reduced resource requirements might decrease the dependency of resource-importing countries (local or regional effect) and will also help to maintain the supply of resources in all world regions (global effect). Alternatively consider the example of a reduction in the combustion of waste which is due to an increase in recycling. The reduction will cause the mitigation of local and regional air pollution as well as of global warming causing emissions of CO. Hence, one far-reaching policy additionally induces ancillary benefits on different geographical levels. We use the framework of an endogenous growth model where waste is generated as an undesired byproduct in the production of the desired output. Nature is assumed to have a certain regenerative capability which depends on the state of the environment. Furthermore, environmental quality is negatively affected by the amount of waste dumped and the amount of resources extracted. The amount of dumped waste can be reduced by recycling firms which process the waste and sell it to the intermediate sector where it serves as substitute for natural resources as an input in production. We show that balanced sustainable growth is only possible if governmental policy ensures a recycling rate of unity. By reviewing the debate on complete recycling, we finally discuss this result from an ecological economics point of view. It is shown that the feasibility of complete recycling depends critically on the nature of wastes, a sufficient storing space for wastes and the availability of sufficient energy.","doc_id":4893,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8912","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Forcing of stratospheric chemistry and dynamics during the Dalton Minimum","authors":"Anet, J.

We carried out several sensitivity ensemble experiments to separate the effects of (i) reduced solar ultra-violet (UV) irradiance, (ii) reduced solar visible and near infrared irradiance, (iii) enhanced galactic cosmic ray intensity as well as less intensive solar energetic proton events and auroral electron precipitation, and (iv) volcanic aerosols. The introduced changes of UV irradiance and volcanic aerosols significantly influence stratospheric dynamics in the early th century, whereas changes in the visible part of the spectrum and energetic particles have smaller effects. A reduction of UV irradiance by %, which represents the presently discussed highest estimate of UV irradiance change caused by solar activity changes, causes global ozone decrease below the stratopause reaching as much as % in the midlatitudes at  hPa and a significant stratospheric cooling of up to °C in the mid-stratosphere and to °C in the lower mesosphere. Changes in energetic particle precipitation lead only to minor changes in the yearly averaged temperature fields in the stratosphere. Volcanic aerosols heat the tropical lower stratosphere, allowing more water vapour to enter the tropical stratosphere, which, via HOx reactions, decreases upper stratospheric and mesospheric ozone by roughly %. Conversely, heterogeneous chemistry on aerosols reduces stratospheric NOx, leading to a % ozone increase in the tropics, whereas a decrease in ozone of up to % is found over Antarctica in boreal winter. The linear superposition of the different contributions is not equivalent to the response obtained in a simulation when all forcing factors are applied during the Dalton Minimum (DM) – this effect is especially well visible for NOx/NOy. Thus, this study also shows the non-linear behaviour of the coupled chemistry-climate system. Finally, we conclude that especially UV and volcanic eruptions dominate the changes in the ozone, temperature and dynamics while the NOx field is dominated by the energetic particle precipitation. Visible radiation changes have only very minor effects on both stratospheric dynamics and chemistry.","doc_id":4948,"prior":"ocean","sdg14":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20798","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Traditional land use, management and biodiversity of European semi-natural grasslands : editorial to the 15th EDGG Special Feature","authors":"Boch, Steffen; Becker, Thomas; Deák, Balasz; Dengler, Jürgen; Wagner, Viktoria","subject":" Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Traditional land use, management and biodiversity of European semi-natural grasslands : editorial to the th EDGG Special Feature;  Ökologie; Seit  Jahren geben Mitglieder der Eurasian Dry Grassland Group (EDGG) und deren Vorgängerorganisationen Grasland-Sonderausgaben (Special Features) in Tuexenia heraus.

Sie boten vielen licht- und wärmeliebenden Pflanzen- und Tierarten günstige Lebensbedingungen, darunter vielen heute gefährdeten Orchideenarten. Seither wandelten sich die Wälder jedoch sukzessiv zu dichteren und dunkleren Hochwäldern, in deren Beschattung und Konkurrenzdruck Cypripedium calceolus ebenso wie zahlreiche weitere, heute gefährdete Lichtwald-Arten verkümmerten. So auch auf der ehemals artenreichen, bis  jedoch in der Sukzession weit fortgeschrittenen und überwucherten Parzelle  in Zuckenriet (SG). Nach aufwändigen Pflegearbeiten wurde diese  erstmals mit Ziegen beweidet. Anhand der vorliegenden Erfolgskontrolle wurde überprüft, ob die Rückführung der Parzelle zu einem Orchideenwald mit geeigneten Standortbedingungen für Cypripedium calceolus und weitere Lichtwald-Arten voranschreitet und wie die extensive Ziegenbeweidung diesen Prozess beeinflusst. Insgesamt hat der Vergleich der pflanzlichen Zusammensetzung und der Standortbedingungen der untersuchten Flächen grössere Unterschiede zwischen «nicht beweidet» (NB) / «beweidet» (B) zur artenreicheren Referenzfläche (R), als zwischen den Bewirtschaftungsformen NB & B gezeigt. Zudem hat die Stratifizierung (flach / steil) einen grösseren Einfluss auf die Standorte und die Pflanzenzusammensetzung auf NB & B als die Bewirtschaftungsform. Sowohl die mechanisch gepflegten NB wie auch die B Flächen zeigen eine positive Entwicklung, mit Spontanansiedlungen von drei Orchideenarten und einer ersten Magerwiesenart. Die einmalige Beweidung hat somit noch keine wesentlichen Unterschiede zur mechanisch gepflegten Fläche bewirkt. Jedoch ist eine deutliche Verringerung der Streudeckung der flachen, beweideten Flächen feststellbar, was sich auf eine künftige Ansiedlung von Magerwiesenarten und Orchideenarten positiv auswirken kann.Light forests rich in structure and species as a result of intensive human use were widespread until the th century. They provided favourable living conditions for many light and thermophilic plant and animal species, including many orchid species that are endangered today. Since then, however, the forests have gradually changed into denser and darker high forests, in whose shade and competitive pressure Cypripedium calceolus as well as numerous other, today endangered species of light forest, disappeared. This was also the case on the formerly species-rich, but by  in succession far advanced, dark and overgrown plot  in Zuckenriet (SG). After intensive maintenance work, the plot had been grazed with goats for the first time in . The present success control, examined whether the return of the plot to an orchid forest with suitable site conditions for Cypripedium calceolus and other light forest species is progressing and in which way this process is influenced by the extensive grazing of goats. Overall, the comparison of the plant composition and site conditions of the investigated areas showed larger differences between \"not grazed\" (NB) / \"grazed\" (B) and the species-rich reference area (R) than between the management forms NB & B. In addition, stratification (flat / steep) has a greater influence on the sites and plant composition on NB & B than the type of management. Both the mechanically maintained NB and the B plots show a positive development, with spontaneous settlements of three orchid species and a first species of lean meadow. The single grazing has not yet caused any significant differences to the mechanically maintained areas, but a significant reduction of the litter coverage of the flat grazed areas can be observed, which may have a positive effect on the future settlement of lean meadow and orchid species.","doc_id":5021,"prior":"litter","sdg14":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20802","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Optimal site conditions for dry grasslands of high conservation value in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland","authors":"Büchler, Marc-Olivier; Billeter, Regula; Dengler, Jürgen","subject":" Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Optimal site conditions for dry grasslands of high conservation value in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Semi-dry semi-natural grasslands such as those of the alliance Mesobromion (Festuco-Brometea) are one of the most-diverse habitat types in Europe with regard to many taxonomic groups, but these remnants of traditional extensive agriculture are currently threatened throughout the continent.

One of the most important contaminants in fish feeds is deoxynivalenol (DON). The investigations that will be presented show effects of DON on carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) using three different DON concentrations representative for commercial fish feeds including increased lipid peroxidation in liver, head kidney and spleen after four weeks of DON feeding of fish. Most of the effects of DON were reversible by two weeks of feeding the uncontaminated control diet. However, histopathological scoring revealed increased liver damage in DON-treated fish, which persisted even after the recovery phase. Biochemical analyses revealed a significantly higher fat content, and consequently an increased energy content in whole body homogenates of fish treated with the highest DON concentration. This suggests that DON affects nutrient metabolism in carp. Changes of lactate dehydrogenase activity in kidneys and muscle and high lactate levels in serum indicated an effect of DON on anaerobic metabolism. Thus, DON affects liver function and metabolism in carp. Effects on growth and mass of fish were not observed during these  weeks lasting experiments, and only marginal DON concentrations were found in muscle and plasma samples. Nevertheless, DON impaired innate immune responses whereby cytotoxic effects of DON partly contributed to this effect. Investigations of acute and chronic responses to DON revealed that the early responses of immune cells include increased expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes whereas prolonged exposure to DON only led to the activation of anti-inflammatory genes. Consequently, these results raise concern about impaired immune function and animal welfare of fish raised in aquaculture.","doc_id":5096,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16765","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Evaluation of environmental taxation on multiple air pollutants in the electricity generation sector : evidence from New South Wales, Australia","authors":"Contreras, Zaida; Ancev, Tihomir; Betz, Regina","subject":"Air pollution; Environmental policy; Monitoring; Pigouvian taxe; SUR model;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Evaluation of environmental taxation on multiple air pollutants in the electricity generation sector : evidence from New South Wales, Australia; Air pollution; Environmental policy; Monitoring; Pigouvian taxe; SUR model;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; This paper investigates the effects of environmental taxes on the emissions intensity (measured as mass per TWh) of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulfur Oxides (SOx), Coarse Particulate Matter (CPM) and Fine Particulate Matter (FPM) from electricity generators in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Electricity generators in NSW are subject to environmental taxation on air pollution through the Load Based Licensing (LBL) scheme.

The econometric estimation, based on a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model with fixed effects, shows that except for SOx, there is no evidence of emissions reduction that can be attributed to the LBL in NSW. In terms of enabling low-cost abatement through specific monitoring methods, there is no evidence of reduction in NOx or SOx emission intensities due to generators implementing continuous monitoring. By contrast, generators using periodic monitoring methods have lower emission intensities of CPM and FPM.

According to the International Facility Management Association (IFMA) guidelines, an organisation is obliged to take precautions to enable continuous business operation and reduce hazards. As FM organizations or facilities services are sometimes responsible for water systems, and hence in the reduction of hazards in this area, the FM’s role is vital for maintaining hygiene. Being healthcare providers, dental surgeries are subject to strict hygienic criteria. During treatment patients are consigned to the care of dentists. The instruments of a dental chair unit (DCU) operate with drinking water from a source. In the process of an implemented hygienic concept in the dental surgeries the care instruments get disinfected systematically. But the water system of the building itself allows limited access, and its hygienic status is not always documented well. As can be seen by this example, hygiene concepts potentially contain blind spots. As a result, not only patients but also medical staff might be exposed to hygienic hazards, which are meant to be reduced to a minimum. Contaminated water lines may cause certain diseases (e.g. Legionnaire’s Disease). Inevitably, the personnel responsible have to manage the facilities appropriately to reduce the risks of a contamination. Literature on Legionella suggests an urgent need to address the issue of Legionella in dental surgeries. This paper will highlight the issue of Legionella in dental surgeries and aims to detect potential hazards from the built environments’ hygiene with a focus on water lines. It will further draw attention to additional criteria relevant for FM and duty holders. During the case study, data was collected on Legionella contamination in dental surgeries' waterlines. Building and water lines of the DCUs were tested as well, in compliance with the Swiss drinking water ordinance. Appreciating the fact, that there was no pathogen Legionella pneumophila detected in all samples of the DCUs, the questions arises on the incident of a potential contamination of the facilities (building) water line system itself as well as on the duties of the stakeholders involved.","doc_id":5411,"prior":"contamination","sdg14":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18481","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Tandem repeats lead to sequence assembly errors and impose multi-level challenges for genome and protein databases","authors":"Tørresen, Ole K; Star, Bastiaan; Mier, Pablo; Andrade-Navarro, Miguel A; Bateman, Alex; Jarnot, Patryk; Gruca, Aleksandra; Grynberg, Marcin; Kajava, Andrey V; Promponas, Vasilis J; Anisimova, Maria; Jakobsen, Kjetill S; Linke, Dirk","subject":"Genomics; Bioinformatics;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Tandem repeats lead to sequence assembly errors and impose multi-level challenges for genome and protein databases; Genomics; Bioinformatics;  Biochemie; The widespread occurrence of repetitive stretches of DNA in genomes of organisms across the tree of life imposes fundamental challenges for sequencing, genome assembly, and automated annotation of genes and proteins. This multi-level problem can lead to errors in genome and protein databases that are often not recognized or acknowledged. As a consequence, end users working with sequences with repetitive regions are faced with 'ready-to-use' deposited data whose trustworthiness is difficult to determine, let alone to quantify. Here, we provide a review of the problems associated with tandem repeat sequences that originate from different stages during the sequencing-assembly-annotation-deposition workflow, and that may proliferate in public database repositories affecting all downstream analyses. As a case study, we provide examples of the Atlantic cod genome, whose sequencing and assembly were hindered by a particularly high prevalence of tandem repeats. We complement this case study with examples from other species, where misannotations and sequencing errors have propagated into protein databases. With this review, we aim to raise the awareness level within the community of database users, and alert scientists working in the underlying workflow of database creation that the data they omit or improperly assemble may well contain important biological information valuable to others.","doc_id":5461,"prior":"cod","sdg14":1},{"id":"56","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22560","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Occurrence of fungi and fungal toxins in fish feed during storage","authors":"Pietsch-Schmied, Constanze; Müller, Georg; Mourabit, Sulayman; Carnal, Simon; Bandara, Kasun","subject":"Aquaculture; Feed contamination; Toxin formation;  Mikrobiologie;  Aquakultur","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"579, 639.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Occurrence of fungi and fungal toxins in fish feed during storage; Aquaculture; Feed contamination; Toxin formation;  Mikrobiologie;  Aquakultur; Periods of unfavorable storing conditions can lead to changes in the quality of fish feeds, as well as the development of relevant mycotoxins.

Die fortschreitende Zersiedlung soll mit der neuen Devise Innenentwicklung gestoppt werden. Diese neue Devise brachte neue Herausforderungen mit sich. Damit die Innenentwicklung nicht durch einen Qualitätsverlust begleitet wird, werden Methoden, Werkzeuge und Instrumente benötigt, welche die qualitative Innenentwicklung sicherstellen. Dies ist eine besondere Herausforderung in Arealen, welche sich durch kulturhistorische Siedlungsstrukturen auszeichnen. Denn diese vorhandenen Strukturen müssen mitberücksichtig werden. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Bachelorarbeit ist es, einen Kriterienkatalog zu erarbeiten, so dass Ortsplaner Siedlungsverdichtungsprojekte evaluieren können. Auf diese Weise können Projekte im Hinblick auf eine qualitativ hochwertige Siedlungsverdichtung optimiert werden. Dabei fokussiert die Bachelorarbeit auf Areale in Städte und Agglomerationen mit kulturhistorisch bedeutenden Siedlungen. Als Anwendungshilfe des Kriterienkataloges wird eine Handlungsempfehlung geschrieben. Der Kriterienkatalog wird basierend auf den rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen, neuen Aspekten in der Fachliteratur und Experteninterviews erarbeitet. Dabei werden neue Aspekte recherchiert, welche die aktuellen rechtlichen Vorgaben bereichern können oder als theoretische Grundlagen dienen. Die Experteninterviews ergänzen die theoretischen neuen Aspekte um die Berufserfahrung. In den Interviews werden Konfliktfelder besprochen, welche in der Umsetzung von Projekten eine hohe Qualität verhindern könnten. Dabei steht die Berufserfahrung der Experten im Zentrum. Um der Komplexität des Themas gerecht zu werden, werden vier Experten interviewt. Die Experten repräsentieren den kantonalen Ortsbildschutz, die Gemeindeentwicklung, die Bauplanung und die Planung des Aussenraums. Als Kriterien für die qualitativ hochwertige Innenentwicklung konnten neun Punkte herausgearbeitet werden. Diese umfassen ein mehrdimensionales Gesamtkonzept, den Einbezug von Akteuren, die Gestaltung, die spezifische Qualität des Ortes, den Freiraum, die Biodiversität, die Klimaanpassung und die Vielfalt. Die jeweiligen Punkte werden anhand von insgesamt  Kriterien bewertet. Diese Kriterien sind nicht abschliessend und keine Bedingung für ein erfolgreiches Projekt, tragen aber dazu bei. In einem weiteren Schritt anschliessend an diese Bachelorarbeit bietet sich eine thematische Erweiterung an. So können die Experteninterviews um Investoren und Architekten ergänzt werden.; Since the partial revision of the Federal Act on Spatial Planning in , the age of urban densification has dawned in Switzerland. The continuous urban sprawl is to be stopped with the new maxim of urban densification. This new maxim brought new challenges. To avoid a loss of quality in the urban densification, methods, tools, and instruments are needed to ensure a qualitative urban densification. This is a particular challenge in areas that are characterized by cultural-historical settlement structures. Because these existing structures must be considered. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to develop a catalog of criteria so that local planners can evaluate settlement densification projects. With this catalog projects can be optimized regarding a high-quality settlement densification. The bachelor thesis focuses on areas in cities and agglomerations with cultural-historically, significant settlements. As an application aid of the criteria catalog, a recommendation for action is written. The criteria catalog is developed based on the legal framework, new aspects in the literature and expert interviews. New aspects are researched, which can enrich the current legal framework or serve as a theoretical basis. The expert interviews complement the theoretical new aspects with professional experience. In the interviews, areas of conflict are discussed that could prevent high quality in the implementation of projects. The focus is on the experts' professional experience. To do justice to the complexity of the topic, four experts are interviewed. The experts represent cantonal protection of cultural-historically, significant settlements, communal development, construction planning and planning of outdoor space. The respective points are evaluated based on a total of  criteria. These criteria are not exhaustive and are not a per se condition for a successful project, but they contribute to it. Nine points were identified as criteria for high quality inner development. These include a multidimensional overall concept, the inclusion of stakeholders, the design, the specific quality of the place, the open space, the biodiversity, the climate adaptation, and the diversity. In a further step following this bachelor thesis, a thematic expansion is possible. Thus, the expert interviews could be supplemented by investors and architects.","doc_id":5519,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7256","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Ein Gras auf dem Weg nach oben : bedroht die Fiederzwenke die Artenvielfalt?","authors":"Krüsi, Bertil","subject":"Climate Change; Brachypodium pinnatum; Swiss National Park;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"580","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Ein Gras auf dem Weg nach oben : bedroht die Fiederzwenke die Artenvielfalt?; Climate Change; Brachypodium pinnatum; Swiss National Park;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Zwischen  und  ist die mittlere Jahrestemperatur in der Schweiz um , °C angestiegen.

For the temporal discretization, an efficient semi-implicit method is applied to the variable viscosity momentum equation.

Understanding N transformations within the context of agricultural systems is crucial for efficient use thereof. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in concentration of N forms (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and organic N) within an aquaponic system, a modern agricultural system, in order to obtain insights into environmental pressures influencing N transformation processes. By measuring the concentrations of the individual N compounds, complemented by the determination of abiotic parameters and other relevant nutrients within the system water at  sampling points, significant differences between compartments that build up an aquaponic system could be demonstrated. These differences were attributed to individual microenvironments specific to the aerobic loop, anaerobic loop and radial flow settler as a connection between the two, shaping the microbial processes within the aquaponic system.","doc_id":5945,"prior":"Aquakultur","sdg14":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20671","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Veränderung der Biodiversität und Artenzusammensetzung der Waldvegetation an der Albis-Uetlibergkette in 26 Jahren","authors":"Staubli, Eline","subject":"Species number; Shannon index; Pielou’s index; Species-area relationship; Light value; Temperate forests; Tree layer cover; Herb layer cover; Resurvey; Artenzahl; Shannon-Index; Pielous-Index; Art-Arealbeziehung; Lichtzahl; Gemässigte Wälder; Baumschichtdeckung; Krautschichtdeckung;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"333.7","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Veränderung der Biodiversität und Artenzusammensetzung der Waldvegetation an der Albis-Uetlibergkette in  Jahren; Species number; Shannon index; Pielou’s index; Species-area relationship; Light value; Temperate forests; Tree layer cover; Herb layer cover; Resurvey; Artenzahl; Shannon-Index; Pielous-Index; Art-Arealbeziehung; Lichtzahl; Gemässigte Wälder; Baumschichtdeckung; Krautschichtdeckung;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Die Veränderungen der Artenvielfalt und Artenzusammensetzung ist Gegenstand vieler Vegetation-Resurveys.

Separate variations in the (i) solar irradiance in the UV-C with wavelengths λ <  nm, (ii) irradiance at wavelengths λ >  nm, (iii) in energetic particle spectrum, and (iv) volcanic aerosol forcing were analyzed separately, and (v) in combination, by means of small ensemble calculations using a coupled atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate model. Global and hemispheric mean surface temperatures show a significant dependence on solar irradiance at λ >  nm. Also, powerful volcanic eruptions in , ,  and  significantly decreased global mean temperature by up to . K for - years after the eruption. However, while the volcanic effect is clearly discernible in the Southern Hemispheric mean temperature, it is less significant in the Northern Hemisphere, partly because the two largest volcanic eruptions occurred in the SH tropics and during seasons when the aerosols were mainly transported southward, partly because of the higher northern internal variability. In the simulation including all forcings, temperatures are in reasonable agreement with the tree ring-based temperature anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere. Interestingly, the model suggests that solar irradiance changes at λ <  nm and in energetic particle spectra have only an insignificant impact on the climate during the Dalton Minimum. This downscales the importance of top–down processes (stemming from changes at λ <  nm) relative to bottom–up processes (from λ >  nm). Reduction of irradiance at λ >  nm leads to a significant (up to %) decrease in the ocean heat content (OHC) between  and  m in depth, whereas the changes in irradiance at λ <  nm or in energetic particles have virtually no effect. Also, volcanic aerosol yields a very strong response, reducing the OHC of the upper ocean by up to .%. In the simulation with all forcings, the OHC of the uppermost levels recovers after - years after volcanic eruption, while the solar signal and the different volcanic eruptions dominate the OHC changes in the deeper ocean and prevent its recovery during the DM. Finally, the simulations suggest that the volcanic eruptions during the DM had a significant impact on the precipitation patterns caused by a widening of the Hadley cell and a shift in the intertropical convergence zone.","doc_id":6063,"prior":"ocean","sdg14":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5460","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Evidence of different flavor formation dynamics by roasting coffee from different origins : on-line analysis with PTR-ToF-MS","authors":"Gloess, Alexia N.; Vietri, Anita; Wieland, Flurin; Smrke, Samo; Schönbächler, Barbara; Sánchez López, José Antonio; Petrozzi, Sergio; Bongers, Sandra; Koziorowski, Thomas; Yeretzian, Chahan","subject":"Roasting; Coffee; PTR-ToF-MS; On-line monitoring;  Getränketechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"663","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Evidence of different flavor formation dynamics by roasting coffee from different origins : on-line analysis with PTR-ToF-MS; Roasting; Coffee; PTR-ToF-MS; On-line monitoring;  Getränketechnologie; Coffees from different origins were roasted to different roast degrees and along varying time temperature roasting profiles. The formation of volatile  organic compounds (VOCs) during roasting was analyzed online by proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). Coffee samples were Coffea arabica from Colombia, Guatemala (Antigua La Ceiba), Ethiopia (Yirga Cheffe, Djimmah) and Coffea canephora var. robusta from Indonesia (Malangsari). The roasting profiles ranged from high temperature short time (HTST) to low temperature long time (LTLT) roasting, and from medium to dark roast degree. The release dynamics of the on-line monitored VOCs differed for the different coffees and showed a strong modulation with the time–temperature roasting profile. While for Guatemalan coffee the formation of VOCs started relatively early in the roasting process, the VOC formation started much later in the case of Yirga Cheffe and Malangsari. Off-line analysis of the coffee brew augmented the measurements. These included headspace solid phase micro extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS SPME GC/MS), content of total solids, chlorogenic acids, caffeine, total polyphenols (Folin Ciocalteu), organic acids (ion chromatography), titratable acidity and pH. Some general trends, irrespective of the coffee origin, were observed, such as an increase in pH when going from an HTST to an LTLT profile or from a medium to dark roast degree. Furthermore, a decrease of total headspace intensity was observed from an HTST to an LTLT roasting profile. In general, the changes of the time temperature roasting profiles and/or the roast degree influenced the intensity of the respective coffee constituents as well as their relative composition differently for different coffee origins.","doc_id":6074,"prior":"acidity","sdg14":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22064","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Disposable bioreactors","authors":"Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Eibl, Dieter","subject":"Biochemistry; Bioreactor; Biotechnology; Downstream Processing; Pharmaceuticals; Therapeutics; Tissue Engineering; Transport;  Technische Chemie","type":"Buch","bid":"660","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Disposable bioreactors; Biochemistry; Bioreactor; Biotechnology; Downstream Processing; Pharmaceuticals; Therapeutics; Tissue Engineering; Transport;  Technische Chemie; Over the past five years, the immense financial pressure on the development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals has resulted in the increasing use and acce- ance of disposables, which are discarded after harvest and therefore intended only for single use. In fact, such disposables are implemented in all the main bioprocess production stages today and an even higher growth than those in the biopharmac- tical market is predicted (reaching double figures). Alongside disposable filter capsules, membrane chromatography units, tubing, connectors, flexible containers processing or containing fluids, freezer systems, mixers and pumps, and fully c- trolled disposable bioreactors of up to , L culture volume are already available on the market. Numerous studies highlight the advantages of disposable bioreactors and reveal their potential for simple, safe and fast seed inoculum production, process devel- ment and small as well as middle volume production (e.g. bioactive substances, viruses for vaccines and gene therapies etc.). They suggest that such disposable bioreactors (typically characterized by the cultivation chamber or bag from plastic materials) may be advantageous for plant, animal and microbial cells. Running industrial activities such as CFD-modelling, development of single-use process monitoring and control technology, and standardized film formulations are attempting to resolve the limitations of the current disposable bioreactors. These achievements, along with substantial improvements in product yield, will reduce the use of stainless steel in the biomanufacturing facilities of the future.","doc_id":6079,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18105","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts","authors":"Stucki, Matthias; Wettstein, Sarah; Amrein, Simon; Mathis, Alex","subject":"LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts; LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Goal: Peat extraction leads to environmental damage in terms of climate and biodiversity. In Switzerland, peat bogs have been protected since  and no peat is currently extracted. However, Switzerland imports an estimated ’ m of peat per year. In order to reduce environmental damage abroad as well, the Federal Council adopted a peat phase-out concept in .The Institute of Natural Resource Sciences of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) assessed the environmental sustainability of various peat substitutes as well as their characteristics, availability and social impacts. Among other products, coconut fibres, cocopeat, bark compost, wood fibres, wood chippings, and TEFA maize fibres were investigated. A follow-up study aimed at further promoting the termination of peat use by extending the study with additional peat alternatives. These are biochar, miscanthus, flax and hemp fibres, grain husks, and coal compost.Methods: The present research project is intended to provide a picture of the environmental impacts of individual substrates and substrate mixtures by means of life cycle assessment, whereby the entire life cycle (raw material extraction, substrate production, transport, use, end-of-life) is taken into account. The substrate components and substrate mixtures are also being evaluated in particular with regard to their crop cultivation properties and medium- to long-term availability for Switzerland. In addition, the study also considers social criteria, which are assessed qualitatively. Finally, the study will provide recommendations for horticulture and, in particular, for producers of ornamental plants, perennials and vegetables.Results: All substrate components exhibit both positive and negative properties with respect to the criteria investigated. Replacing peat with local products such as miscanthus, hemp and flax fibres, wood fibres, TEFA maize fibres or bark compost significantly reduces the emissions of extraction, transport and use of peat. With regard to ecological and social aspects, bark compost, TEFA maize fibres, wood fibres, wood chippings and husks perform very well. As these products are expected to be available in the future, their use as peat substitutes is highly recommended.The availability of wood fibres and wood chippings depends on the price of the energy industry and is therefore subject to fluctuations. Hemp and flax fibres, husks, TEFA maize fibres, and bark compost, on the other hand, hardly compete with energy use. These products are therefore expected to be readily available for horticulture in the future and can be manufactured without significant negative ecological and social impacts.The coconut-based substrate components are associated with higher environmental impacts and social risks than locally manufactured products. On the contrary, the social impacts of production and processing of peat substitutes are assumed to be very low or non-existent in Switzerland. Biochar can be produced locally with readily available substrates and has similar consistency and properties to peat, making it an attractive peat alternative.Environmental impact of peat substitutes are lowest if they are locally produced and processed with low material and energy consumption, when few pesticides and fertilisers have been used in agricultural cultivation and no thermal processing is necessary after harvesting.

Among them, envelope-based approaches like the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) are particularly advantageous, as they require only presence data. Based on the assumption that the absolute frequency of species presence is a direct indicator of habitat suitability (HS), habitat suitability indices (HSI) are computed. However, this assumption may be misleading when the scarcity of optimal habitat forces most of the individuals to live in suboptimal conditions. This often happens when the environmental conditions in the study area represent only a marginal part of the species fundamental niche.In this study we propose three new HS algorithms for ENFA models, which address such ‘edge of niche’ situations. The first algorithm (area-adjusted median, Ma) takes the availability of environmental conditions in the study area into account, the second (median + extremum, Me) addresses situations where the species’ optimum is at or beyond the extremum of the investigated environmental gradient, and the third (area-adjusted median + extremum, Mae) combines both approaches. These algorithms were applied to two populations of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), situated in different positions relative to the environmental gradient represented in the respective study area, and compared with the classical median algorithm (M). We evaluated the models using cross-validation and a comparison with an expert model based on external data.In both study areas, the HS maps obtained with the three new algorithms differed visibly from those calculated with the median algorithm. Cross-validation and comparison with external data showed that the new algorithms always provided better models, with the extremum-based algorithms (Me and Mae) performing best. We conclude that the new algorithms can extend the applicability of ENFA-models to a broader range of conservation-relevant species by improving HS calculations for skewed species-habitat relationships in marginal habitats.","doc_id":6339,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5353","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Attitudes towards potential animal flagship species in nature conservation : a survey among students of different educational institutions","authors":"Schlegel, Jürg; Rupf, Reto","subject":" Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Attitudes towards potential animal flagship species in nature conservation : a survey among students of different educational institutions;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Using a standardised questionnaire, a total of  students from two different Swiss primary schools, grammar schools and agricultural schools as well as students from a Swiss University of Applied Sciences were asked about their attitudes towards  different indigenous wildlife animal species. In the questionnaire, six mammal, five bird, two reptile, four amphibian and ten insect species, all with potential flagship quality, were individually presented on a colour photograph without any further background information. The participants were also asked to give individual reasons for species-related affinity or antipathy. In addition, it was ascertained whether they were able to correctly identify and name each species.The survey shows a heterogeneous pattern, whereby butterflies, birds and most mammals are, on average, more higher appreciated than reptiles, insects (excl. butterflies) and amphibians. Furthermore, it becomes evident that attitudes do not only depend on the species themselves, but also on other factors, particularly the type of educational institution attended. In general, there is no significant difference in attitudes to animals between males and females. At species level, females show significantly higher affinity for 'loveable animals' and a lesser degree of affinity for 'fear-relevant animals'. Respondents seem to show higher affinity for species they can identify than for unfamiliar species.

We apply a partial moments-based model to test the effects of each strategy on welfare defined as expected crop income, variability (variance) and downside risk (skewness). Our comprehensive econometric approach differentiates climatic shocks, weather and climate change. The results suggest that the benefits from greater diversification in terms of enhanced land productivity and lower production costs could surpass the foregone benefit from greater efficiency associated with more concentrated production systems. Crop richness and evenness each reduce exposure to crop income risk, especially for more vulnerable farmers who produce below the expected revenue threshold.

In this study, we describe how the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging has permitted us to reconstruct with precision the architecture of the ventricular myocardial fibres in the post-mortem swine heart. Methods and Results: We obtained diffusion-weighted spin-echo measurements of autopsied porcine hearts using a whole body MR system. We calculated the diffusion tensor and the corresponding eigenvectors on a voxel-by-voxel basis. This permitted us to colour code the fibres, and reconstruct them by connecting voxels in direction of the largest eigenvector. Such reconstructions show that, in the middle layer of the left ventricle, most of the fibres have a circular orientation, albit that a far from negligible component runs in a transverse direction. With increasing distance from the epicardium, the orientation of the fibres shows a continuous change in angulation with respect to an axis normal to the epicardium. Conclusion: Our data presented here supports the concept that the ventricular mass is arranged as a complex three-dimensional mesh of tangential and intruding fibres. The data offers no support for the concept of a ‘unique myocardial band’. The method has the potential to detecting deviations from this basic normal architecture, being capable of reconstructing the ventricular mass so as to assess the spatial coordinates of any single fibre strand. The technique, therefore, has major potential clinical applications in the setting of the failing or malformed heart, potentially being able to identify either systematic or regional disarray of the myocardial fibres.","doc_id":6930,"prior":"destructive","sdg14":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6667","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Freshwater ecoacoustics as a tool for continuous ecosystem monitoring","authors":"Linke, Simon; Gifford, Toby; Desjonquères, Camille; Tonolla, Diego; Aubin, Thierry; Barclay, Leah; Karaconstantis, Chris; Kennard, Mark J; Rybak, Fanny; Sueur, Jérôme","subject":" Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Freshwater ecoacoustics as a tool for continuous ecosystem monitoring;  Ökologie; Copyright by the Ecological Society of America; Passive acoustic monitoring is gaining popularity in ecology as a practical and non-invasive approach to surveying ecosystems.

This study analyses taxonomic and functional richness in European grasslands along continental‐scale temperature and precipitation gradients.LocationEurope.MethodsWe quantified functional and taxonomic richness of , vegetation plots. Six plant traits, related to resource acquisition and conservation, were analysed to describe plant community functional composition. Using a null‐model approach we derived functional richness effect sizes that indicate higher or lower diversity than expected given the taxonomic richness. We assessed the variation in absolute functional and taxonomic richness and in functional richness effect sizes along gradients of minimum temperature, temperature range, annual precipitation, and precipitation seasonality using a multiple general additive modelling approach.ResultsFunctional and taxonomic richness was high at intermediate minimum temperatures and wide temperature ranges. Functional and taxonomic richness was low in correspondence with low minimum temperatures or narrow temperature ranges. Functional richness increased and taxonomic richness decreased at higher minimum temperatures and wide annual temperature ranges. Both functional and taxonomic richness decreased with increasing precipitation seasonality and showed a small increase at intermediate annual precipitation. Overall, effect sizes of functional richness were small. However, effect sizes indicated trait divergence at extremely low minimum temperatures and at low annual precipitation with extreme precipitation seasonality.ConclusionsFunctional and taxonomic richness of European grassland communities vary considerably over temperature and precipitation gradients. Overall, they follow similar patterns over the climate gradients, except at high minimum temperatures and wide temperature ranges, where functional richness increases and taxonomic richness decreases. This contrasting pattern may trigger new ideas for studies that target specific hypotheses focused on community assembly processes. And though effect sizes were small, they indicate that it may be important to consider climate seasonality in plant diversity studies.","doc_id":7048,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23726","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Climbing ropes : environmental hotspots in their life cycle and potentials for optimization","authors":"Bradford, Sebastian; Rupf, Reto; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Climbing rope; Polyamide; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Product development; Outdoor activities; Mountaineering; User behaviour; Greenhouse gas emissions;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"338.927","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Climbing ropes : environmental hotspots in their life cycle and potentials for optimization; Climbing rope; Polyamide; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Product development; Outdoor activities; Mountaineering; User behaviour; Greenhouse gas emissions;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Mountain sports are affected by climate change in a way which few other sports are. Melting glaciers, less snowfall in many regions and rock fall due to thawing permafrost have a direct impact on athletes and businesses around mountain sports.

We examined the life cycle environmental impact of climbing ropes, from the production chain to the usage and the disposal, produced and sold by the Mammut Sports Group.

Goals of these policies that are related to aquaponics include promoting innovation, increasing competitiveness and sustainability, improving access to space and water, welfare of fish, prevention of waste, and promoting resource-efficiency and low-carbon economy. Aquaponics contributes to achieving these goals by minimising water and nutrient use, utilising areas unfit for other food production systems, facilitating local food production and thus providing new business opportunities.

The wave propagation induced by passing through a T-junction in the flow complies with the wave conservation laws which concern both the wave reflection and the transmission. It has been shown that all computations can be simply implemented in a computation tool like MS Excel. This considerably ensures both the accuracy and the reliability of computations. At a hydraulic system of Pelton turbines, excellent computational results have been achieved. The application to a highly complex hydraulic system with pump shut-off and the simultaneous closing of a spherical valve also showed excellent results, when compared with the field measurements.

The entire computation covers the flow rate in the system, the reverse flow through the pump, the pressure response, the deceleration of the rotational speed and the system oscillations.","doc_id":7282,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"53","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11264","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Kormoranschäden an Netzen und Reusen : Ausmass und Prävention am Neuenburgersee","authors":"Robin, Klaus; Vogel, Michael; Graf, Roland Felix; Perron, Muriel","subject":" Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Kormoranschäden an Netzen und Reusen : Ausmass und Prävention am Neuenburgersee;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Bericht der Fachstelle Wildtier- und Landschaftsmanagement WILMA für die Sektion Jagd, Fischerei und Waldbiodiversität JAFIWA / Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU.","doc_id":7381,"prior":"Fischerei","sdg14":1},{"id":"23","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21489","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Evaluation of potential co-benefits of air pollution control and climate mitigation policies for China's electricity sector","authors":"Wei, Xinyang; Tong, Qing; Magill, Iain; Vithayasrichareon, Peerapat; Betz, Regina","subject":"Air pollution; China; Co-benefits; Electricity sector;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Evaluation of potential co-benefits of air pollution control and climate mitigation policies for China's electricity sector; Air pollution; China; Co-benefits; Electricity sector;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Since the rapid industrialisation, local air pollution has become one of China's most important environmental issues. In consequence, increasingly stringent air pollution control policies have been established by the Chinese government. These policies will inevitably affect China's future electric power investment given the key contribution of this sector to air pollution. This sector is also a key contributor to China’s greenhouse gas emissions and hence climate policy efforts. We present a study exploring what impacts of potential interactions and combinations of different policy efforts for local air pollutant control and carbon mitigation have on China's future electricity generation mix. The study utilises a novel generation portfolio model that explicitly incorporates key uncertainties in future technology costs and different policy approaches including carbon pricing and air emissions control. The findings highlight that China can achieve significant reductions for both greenhouse gas and local air pollutant emissions through a combination of climate change and air pollution control policies. Furthermore, there are potentially significant co-benefits from the perspectives of both air pollutant control and carbon mitigation and, notably, that the co-benefit from a sufficient carbon pricing policy to air pollution emission reductions is much stronger than that from stringent air pollutant control policies to carbon mitigation. Specifically, in order to achieve substantial local air pollution and greenhouse gas mitigation from China's electricity sector, it is necessary to close coal-fired power plants rather than merely seeking to clean their air pollution emissions up.","doc_id":7536,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14487","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Genomes reveal marked differences in the adaptive evolution between orangutan species","authors":"Mattle-Greminger, Maja P.; Bilgin Sonay, Tugce; Nater, Alexander; Pybus, Marc; Desai, Tariq; de Valles, Guillem; Casals, Ferran; Scally, Aylwyn; Bertranpetit, Jaume; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; van Schaik, Carel P.; Anisimova, Maria; Krützen, Michael","subject":"Cognitive evolution; Demographic history; Great apes; Local adaptation; Pleistocene glaciations; Pongo;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Genomes reveal marked differences in the adaptive evolution between orangutan species; Cognitive evolution; Demographic history; Great apes; Local adaptation; Pleistocene glaciations; Pongo;  Biochemie; Integrating demography and adaptive evolution is pivotal to understanding the evolutionary history and conservation of great apes.

They are particularly abundant in mammals, where by conservative estimates one in three proteins contain a TR. High generation-scale duplication and deletion rates were reported for nucleic TR units. However, it is not known whether protein TR units can also be frequently lost or gained providing a source of variation for rapid adaptation of protein function, or alternatively, tend to have conserved TR unit configurations over long evolutionary times. To obtain a systematic picture for proteins TRs, we performed a proteome-wide analysis of the mode of evolution for human TRs. For this purpose, we propose a novel method for the detection of orthologous TRs based on circular profile hidden Markov models. For all detected TRs we reconstructed bi-species TR unit phylogenies across  eukaryotes ranging from human to yeast. Moreover, we performed additional analyses to correlate functional and structural annotations of human TRs with their mode of evolution. Surprisingly, we find that the vast majority of human TRs are ancient, with TR unit number and order preserved intact since distant speciation events. For example, ≥% of all human TRs have been strongly conserved at least since the root of all mammals, approximately  Mya ago. Further, we find no human protein TR that shows evidence for strong recent duplications and deletions. The results are in contrast to high generation-scale mutability of nucleic TRs. Presumably, most protein TRs fold into stable and conserved structures that are indispensable for the function of the TR-containing protein.

ECA reeds showed significantly higher diversities and densities of grasshopper species than ECA meadows and ECA pastures. ECA reeds also contained almost % of all observed individuals of the grasshoppers on the Swiss Red List. Within the ECA reeds, significantly higher species diversity was recorded in moor grass meadows and tall forb communities compared to low sedge fens, tall sedge fens and subareas with high density of Phragmites australis. Grasshopper densities in moor grass meadows and tall forb communities proved to be significantly higher than those in tall sedge fens.Compared to previous surveys in Schönenberg ZH from  and , the grasshopper diversity in the conventionally managed meadows did not significantly change, but there were considerable shifts in the relative abundance at species level. For example, the rather xerophilous species Chorthippus biguttulus was more frequent in conventionally managed meadows in  than in  and , while the regionally more hygrophilous species Chorthippus dorsatus showed an opposite trend.

By assuming a generic function for the blast load, which is multiplicative comprising its spatial and temporal parts, a set of  dimensionless parameters, representative of the load and plate deformation, were identified and recast in the form of dimensionless functions of stand-off to charge diameter ratio. Parametric studies were performed using commercial code ABAQUS’s module of Finite Element hydrocode using MMALE and MMAE techniques, and combined with regression analyses to quantify the dimensional parameters and the expressions for dimensionless functions. A few numerical studies with various FE mesh types were also performed to validate the transient deflections against the small-scale experiments. For pulse loading due to proximal charges of small orders of stand-off/charge diameter ratio, the magnitude of the transverse deflection increased abruptly with incremental decrease in stand-off, in contradistinction to the plate deformations at higher stand-offs where variations in displacement are smooth. This confirmed the existence of a stand-off at which a transition in behaviour takes place. For stand-off values less than charge diameter, a dimensionless energy absorbing effectiveness factor was considered to investigate the prediction of rupture in the plate corresponding to different charge masses. This factor is measured as a baseline parameter to predict, using solely numerical means, the blast loads which ensue rupture on full-scale prototypes.","doc_id":7703,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11263","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Auerhuhnprojekt Teufimatt : Monitoring der Wirkung forstlicher Aufwertungsmassnahmen auf Raufusshuhnvorkommen und Nahrungsangebot für Küken","authors":"Graf, Roland Felix; Bitterlin, Lisa","subject":" Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333, 590","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Auerhuhnprojekt Teufimatt : Monitoring der Wirkung forstlicher Aufwertungsmassnahmen auf Raufusshuhnvorkommen und Nahrungsangebot für Küken;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Tiere (Zoologie); Eine Veröffentlichung der Fachstelle Wildtier- und Landschaftsmanagement WILMA im Auftrag der Abteilung Natur, Jagd und Fischerei / lawa Luzern.","doc_id":7739,"prior":"Fischerei","sdg14":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13131","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Environmental tax reform : efficiency and political feasibility","authors":"Felder, Stefan; Schleiniger, Reto","subject":"Computable general equilibrium model; Political feasability; Cost efficiency; Environmental tax reform;  Wirtschaft;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"330, 333.7","year":"2002","for_data_analysis":"Environmental tax reform : efficiency and political feasibility; Computable general equilibrium model; Political feasability; Cost efficiency; Environmental tax reform;  Wirtschaft;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Although market-based environmental measures like uniform CO taxes reach a given standard at minimal cost, they do not prevail in real world policies.

While positive effects on soil structure have been extensively reported, the effects on specific root- and soil-associated microorganisms are less known. The aim of this study was to investigate how conservation tillage and organic farming influence the frequency and activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads. Amplicon sequencing using the S rRNA gene revealed that Pseudomonas is among the most abundant bacterial taxa in the root microbiome of field-grown wheat, independent of agronomical practices. However, pseudomonads carrying genes required for the biosynthesis of specific antimicrobial compounds were enriched in samples from conventionally farmed plots without tillage. In contrast, disease resistance tests indicated that soil from conventional no tillage plots is less resistant to the soilborne pathogen Pythium ultimum compared to soil from organic reduced tillage plots, which exhibited the highest resistance of all compared cropping systems. Reporter strain-based gene expression assays did not reveal any differences in Pseudomonas antimicrobial gene expression between soils from different cropping systems. Our results suggest that plant-beneficial pseudomonads can be favoured by certain soil cropping systems, but soil resistance against plant diseases is likely determined by a multitude of biotic factors in addition to Pseudomonas.","doc_id":7911,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11261","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Wildraumeinteilung des Kantons Aargau : Bericht für die Sektion Jagd und Fischerei des Kantons Aargau","authors":"Graf, Roland Felix; Bächtiger, Martina; Robin, Klaus","subject":" Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Wildraumeinteilung des Kantons Aargau : Bericht für die Sektion Jagd und Fischerei des Kantons Aargau;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Eine Veröffentlichung der Forschungsgruppe WILMA.","doc_id":7932,"prior":"Fischerei","sdg14":1},{"id":"54","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11316","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Begrünte Dächer : ökofaunistische Charakterisierung eines neuen Habitattyps in Siedlungsgebieten anhand eines Vergleichs der Spinnenfauna von Dachbegrünungen mit naturschutzrelevanten Bahnarealen in Basel (Schweiz)","authors":"Brenneisen, Stephan; Hänggi, Ambros","subject":"Stadtökologie; Spinnen; Naturschutz; Dachbegrünung;  Ökologie;  Raumplanung (Städtebau)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577, 711","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"Begrünte Dächer : ökofaunistische Charakterisierung eines neuen Habitattyps in Siedlungsgebieten anhand eines Vergleichs der Spinnenfauna von Dachbegrünungen mit naturschutzrelevanten Bahnarealen in Basel (Schweiz); Stadtökologie; Spinnen; Naturschutz; Dachbegrünung;  Ökologie;  Raumplanung (Städtebau); Begrünte Dachflächen können für verschiedene Arten aus Bahnarealen und schotterreichen Ufergebieten einen Ersatzstandort darstellen.

Carbon dioxide (CO) is the main by-product in exhaust plumes. Although it does not have any health effect, it is well-known its influence on the climate warming, in addition, the fluid-dynamics behaviour of CO is representative for any gas pollutant in the plume. The main pollutants are waste products of the industrial activity or the combustion processes, mainly carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen and sulfur oxides (NOx, SOx) in gas phase and solid particulate matter.In the present work, we have made a comprehensive study of the effect that CO plumes from the harbour of Tromsø (Norway) have in the contamination levels in the city. We have used computational fluid dynamics modelling of CO transport and diffusion in air. OpenFOAM® has been used for the simulation of the gas mixture. The Navier-Stokes equation has been solved including compressibility effects of perfect gases and buoyancy effects. Turbulence effects have been treated within the k- model of the Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The simulation workflow has been improved by developing a steady-state solver that overcomes the inefficiency of the transient calculation when it comes to calculate long time effects. The effects of solid pollutants will be addressed using a Lagrangian solver to describe the transport within the plume.The influence of the wind speed and direction, as well as, the height of the chimneys in the distribution of CO and pollutants has been studied comprehensively. The parameter studies have been run in the online platform KALEIDOSIM®. The presented results will help to evaluate the impact of the CO emissions in the everyday life of local citizens.","doc_id":8009,"prior":"contamination","sdg14":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16444","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"'was äim präicht, mu mer äifach ha' : Gemeinplätze in biographischen Erzählungen","authors":"Gugger, Franziska","subject":"Erzählung; Biographie; Gemeinplatz; Phraseologie;  Gebrauch der Standardsprache","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"418","year":"1999","for_data_analysis":"\"was äim präicht, mu mer äifach ha\" : Gemeinplätze in biographischen Erzählungen; Erzählung; Biographie; Gemeinplatz; Phraseologie;  Gebrauch der Standardsprache","doc_id":8015,"prior":"mer","sdg14":1},{"id":"56","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22839","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Neue Vermittlungsansätze zu den Interaktionen von Flora und Fauna in naturnahen Freiräumen","authors":"Müller, Corina","subject":"ökologische Interaktionen; Biodiversitätsförderung; naturnahe Gärten; naturnahe Anlagen; Privatflächen im Siedlungsraum; Lebensraumstrukturen; Flora; Fauna;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik);  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333.7, 580, 590","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Neue Vermittlungsansätze zu den Interaktionen von Flora und Fauna in naturnahen Freiräumen; ökologische Interaktionen; Biodiversitätsförderung; naturnahe Gärten; naturnahe Anlagen; Privatflächen im Siedlungsraum; Lebensraumstrukturen; Flora; Fauna;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik);  Tiere (Zoologie); Biodiversitätsförderung bei Privatpersonen fängt mit der Aufklärung und Vermittlung von Wissen an.

The system consists of interconnected compartments for fish rearing and plant production, as well as for water filtration, with all compartments hosting diverse microbial communities, which interact within the system. Due to the design, function and operation mode of the individual compartments, each of them exhibits unique biotic and abiotic conditions. Elucidating how these conditions shape microbial communities is useful in understanding how these compartments may affect the quality of the water, in which plants and fish are cultured.Results: We investigated the possible relationships between microbial communities from biofilms and water quality parameters in different compartments of the aquaponic system. Biofilm samples were analyzed by total community profiling for bacterial and archaeal communities. The results implied that the oxygen levels could largely explain the main differences in abiotic parameters and microbial communities in each compartment of the system. Aerobic system compartments are highly biodiverse and work mostly as a nitrifying biofilter, whereas biofilms in the anaerobic compartments contain a less diverse community. Finally, the part of the system connecting the aerobic and anaerobic processes showed common conditions where both aerobic and anaerobic processes were observed.Conclusion:Different predicted microbial activities for each compartment were found to be supported by the abiotic parameters, of which the oxygen saturation, total organic carbon and total nitrogen differentiated clearly between samples from the main aerobic loop and the anaerobic compartments.

However, the P-YES has not been directly compared with established methods. We compared the performance of a microtiter plate YES (lyticase-YES, L-YES) to P-YES on silica gel HPTLC plates using β-estradiol (E),  chemicals representative of migrants from plastic FCM, and three migrates of coated metal food cans. Effective doses (ED, ED) and estradiol equivalencies were calculated for each chemical. Thirteen chemicals had calculable EDs in the L-YES or P-YES, with average EDs -fold (range .–) more potent in P-YES than in the L-YES. Normalized to E, the median estrogenicity was within .-fold (.–.) between the assays. Therefore, P-YES was as or more sensitive than L-YES but potencies relative to E were comparable between assays. With chromatography, the P-YES detected estrogenicity in coated metal cans, effects that were unmeasurable in L-YES. With the sample preparation methods used in this study, both YES assays are sufficiently sensitive to detect bisphenol A below the specific migration limit for plastic packaging (. mg/kg food). This study demonstrates that P-YES outperforms L-YES because it is more sensitive, provides comparable estradiol equivalents, and circumvents confounding mixture effects. The P-YES will be useful for routine monitoring of FCM and toxicant identification in problematic materials.","doc_id":8085,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24550","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"LOTVS : a global collection of permanent vegetation plots","authors":"Sperandii, Marta Gaia; de Bello, Francesco; Valencia, Enrique; Götzenberger, Lars; Bazzichetto, Manuele; Galland, Thomas; E‐Vojtkó, Anna; Conti, Luisa; Adler, Peter B.; Buckley, Hannah; Danihelka, Jiří; Day, Nicola J.; Dengler, Jürgen; Eldridge, David J.; Estiarte, Marc; García‐González, Ricardo; Garnier, Eric; Gómez‐García, Daniel; Hallett, Lauren; Harrison, Susan; Herben, Tomas; Ibáñez, Ricardo; Jentsch, Anke; Juergens, Norbert; Kertész, Miklós; Kimuyu, Duncan M.; Klumpp, Katja; Le Duc, Mike; Louault, Frédérique; Marrs, Rob H.; Ónodi, Gábor; Pakeman, Robin J.; Pärtel, Meelis; Peco, Begoña; Peñuelas, Josep; Rueda, Marta; Schmidt, Wolfgang; Schmiedel, Ute; Schuetz, Martin; Skalova, Hana; Šmilauer, Petr; Šmilauerová, Marie; Smit, Christian; Song, Ming‐Hua; Stock, Martin; Val, James; Vandvik, Vigdis; Wesche, Karsten; Wiser, Susan K.; Woodcock, Ben A.; Young, Truman P.; Yu, Fei‐Hai; Wolf, Amelia A.; Zobel, Martin; Lepš, Jan","subject":"Ecoinformatics; Ecological succession; Ecosystem stability; Global scale; Permanent plot; Plant community; Plant diversity; Temporal analysis; Time-series; Vegetation;  Ökologie;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577, 580","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"LOTVS : a global collection of permanent vegetation plots; Ecoinformatics; Ecological succession; Ecosystem stability; Global scale; Permanent plot; Plant community; Plant diversity; Temporal analysis; Time-series; Vegetation;  Ökologie;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Analysing temporal patterns in plant communities is extremely important to quantify the extent and the consequences of ecological changes, especially considering the current biodiversity crisis.

With  data sets from five continents and , vegetation time-series monitored for at least  years and mostly on an annual basis, LOTVS possibly represents the largest collection of temporally fine-grained vegetation time-series derived from permanent plots and made accessible to the research community. As such, it has an outstanding potential to support innovative research in the fields of vegetation science, plant ecology and temporal ecology.","doc_id":8102,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23848","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Clarification of yeast cell suspensions by a highly porous polyamide nanofiber sponge","authors":"Mousavi, Sara; Filipová, Lucie; Ebert, Jürgen; Heiligtag, Florian Johannes; Daumke, Ralph; Loser, Werner; Ledergerber, Bettina; Frank, Brian; Adlhart, Christian","subject":"Yeast cell filtration; Nanofibrous polyamide sponge; Depth filtration; Pore blocking mechanism; 3D nanofiber aerogel;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Clarification of yeast cell suspensions by a highly porous polyamide nanofiber sponge; Yeast cell filtration; Nanofibrous polyamide sponge; Depth filtration; Pore blocking mechanism; D nanofiber aerogel;  Technische Chemie; Depth filtration is an attractive method for initial clarification of broth for removing cells and cell debris. Electrospun nanofibers with their large specific surface area and a porous structure are known as attractive materials in filtration processes. However, dead-end filtration of cells through nanofiber mats (NFM) always leads to cake formation and increasing resistance. In this study, for the first time, a nanofiber sponge (NFS) or nanofiber aerogel was synthetized from polyamide  (PA) building blocks. The NFS was flexible, highly porous and mechanically stable. The pore size of the NFS was tuned between  and  µm during the cryogenic processing step. Volumetric flux and filtration efficiency of the NFS depended on the pore size and the results were compared with those for NFM from the same PA nanofiber material. Dead-end filtration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was feasible at a low differential pressure of . kPa and cell filtration efficiency was >  %. Modelling of the filtration process revealed that cake formation is prevented by NFS filters since cells are able to penetrate into the filter and to adsorb on their internal surface. The filtration characteristics were also compared with commercial depth filters and revealed the high flux of NFS filters along with the possibility to avoid filter aids and a low environmental impact. PA-NFS filters may become a new and cost effective generation of filters for removing different cells or cell debris from broth and other applications.","doc_id":8185,"prior":"debris","sdg14":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10301","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Ecological compensation on the roof : ground-nesting birds and vegetation","authors":"Baumann, Nathalie","subject":"Urban biodiversity; Ground nesting bird; Breeding success; Ecological compensation; Biodivers roofs; Nature based solutions;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"333, 577","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Ecological compensation on the roof : ground-nesting birds and vegetation; Urban biodiversity; Ground nesting bird; Breeding success; Ecological compensation; Biodivers roofs; Nature based solutions;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie; Green roof activities and research in Switzerland have focused for many years on the potential of habitat creation on roof surfaces to compensate for the loss of ground habitats which are destroyed or damaged as a result of constant development.Greening roofs closes an ecological circle, providing nature and environment protection in urban zones with a new chance to improve biodiversity.

In aquaponics (AP), which is the combined cultivation of fish (aquaculture) and plants (hydroponic) in one water cycle, plants assimilate P present in aquaculture discharge. The aim of this study was to investigate the P-cycling in aquaponic in order to be able to further optimise P utilisation. For this, the effect of pH manipulation on the system was examined. Three replicates of semi-commercial size aquaponic systems, stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and planted with lettuce (Salanova® Batavia) were monitored from th September to th November . The pH was adjusted to .±. by adding acid (HCl) during weeks  and , and to .±. by adding bases (KOH and Ca(OH)) during weeks  and . Ortho-P and total-P from different sampling points in the system (system water, sludge, and deposits) were analysed. In addition, biomass production of fish and lettuce, and its nutrient content was compared between the triplicates. The P balance showed that % and % of the total P inputs provided by feed and water were absorbed by fish and plants, respectively. % of P accumulated in the system water, and % in form of deposits (biofilm on sump and fish tank surface and deposits on digester heater). Furthermore, digested sludge contained more ortho-P (-% of total-P) than fresh sludge (-% of total-P). In addition, around % of total-P was present as ortho-P in a system water. The ortho-P concentrations after the manipulations of pH in the aquaponic system water surprisingly increased with increasing pH. This is probably due to the complex dynamics between P and Ca. The established P mass balance identiﬁed and quantiﬁed several P pools, demonstrating that aquaponics systems can maximize overall P utilization if a digester is included into the loop.","doc_id":8438,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24440","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Ausarbeitung eines mobilen Lehrmittels zum Thema Saatgut","authors":"Giovanoli, Mauro","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"630","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Ausarbeitung eines mobilen Lehrmittels zum Thema Saatgut;  Landwirtschaft; Seit Beginn des .

Denn nicht nur sind sie für knapp zwei Drittel aller Arbeitnehmenden in der Schweiz verantwortlich, sondern sie sind durch ihre traditionellen Unternehmenswerte und teils hochspezialisierten Produkte und Dienstleistungen auch wichtige Aushängeschilder des Wirtschaftsstandorts Schweiz. Hingegen scheint der Fokus bezüglich Nachhaltigkeitsbemühungen bisher verstärkt auf Grossunternehmen gelegt gewesen zu sein. Dies mitunter auch deshalb, weil öffentlichkeitswirksame Kampagnen über durchgeführte Massnahmen oftmals nur durch umfassenden Ressourcenaufwand bewerkstelligt werden können, über welche KMU in den wenigsten Fällen verfügen.Daher erstaunt es auch nicht, dass KMU und deren Nachhaltigkeitsverhalten bisher noch nicht in dem Masse untersucht worden sind, wie es ihnen aufgrund ihrer Bedeutung eigentlich zukommen würde. Diesem Umstand versucht die vorliegende Arbeit in dem Sinne beizukommen, als dass sie sich der Fragestellung annimmt, welche Faktoren die Integration der Nachhaltigkeitsbemühungen von KMU in den Branchen Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Fischerei, verarbeitendes Gewerbe und Baugewerbe im Kanton Zürich beeinflusst.Dies erfolgte zum einen durch die Aufarbeitung der bestehenden Literatur und zum anderen wurden KMU im Kanton Zürich durch eine empirische Untersuchung zum Thema Nachhaltigkeit in ihrem Betrieb befragt. Dazu wurden die Unternehmen aus den besagten Branchen kontaktiert und gebeten einen standardisierten Fragebogen auszufüllen. Die resultierenden Ergebnisse wurden daraufhin in deskriptiver Form untersucht.Daraus ging hervor, dass Nachhaltigkeitsbestrebungen in Zürcher KMU unabhängig ihrer Grösse mehrheitlich als wichtig bis sehr wichtig eingestuft werden und dahingehend auch bereits diverse Massnahmen umgesetzt wurden. Darunter befinden sich leichter umsetzbare Massnahmen, wie Abfalltrennung oder die Sensibilisierung der Mitarbeitenden für das Thema, sowie umfangreichere, wie Gebäudeoptimierungen oder die Erneuerung der Fahrzeugflotte. Grundsätzlich lässt sich jedoch sagen, dass nur ein sehr kleiner Anteil bisher noch keine Massnahmen umgesetzt hat.Die wichtigsten Gründe für die Umsetzung von Massnahmen scheinen die persönliche Überzeugung der Inhaberinnen und Inhaber, respektive der Beschäftigten, gefolgt von Kosteneinsparungen und der Verbesserung der Unternehmenswahrnehmung zu sein. Ebenso gilt es festzuhalten, dass Entscheidungsträgerinnen und -träger von KMU zu Nachhaltigkeitsthemen in der Regel durchschnittlich gut informiert sind und es daher nicht an fehlendem Bewusstsein liegt, wenn Massnahmen nur in beschränktem Mass umgesetzt wurden. Vielmehr überwiegen in solchen Fällen Gründe wie beispielsweise zu hohe Kosten für entsprechende Anpassungen oder Zeitmangel. Hinsichtlich des Drucks unterschiedlicher Stakeholder hat sich gezeigt, dass von den meisten Anspruchsgruppen überhaupt kein bis leichter Druck ausgeht, bezüglich Nachhaltigkeit mehr zu tun.Abschliessend lässt sich konstatieren, dass es das Nachhaltigkeitsverhalten von KMU im Kanton Zürich im Idealfall unternehmensspezifisch zu betrachten gilt und allgemeine Vorgaben oftmals zu kurz greifen, da dadurch der Komplexität des KMU-Umfelds nicht ausreichend Rechnung getragen wird.","doc_id":9075,"prior":"Fischerei","sdg14":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23429","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Vegetation changes in urban grasslands over 25 years in the city of Zurich, Switzerland","authors":"Kummli, Julia; Widmer, Stefan; Wilhelm, Markus; Dengler, Jürgen; Billeter, Regula","subject":"Switzerland; Zurich; Biodiversity; Arrhenatherion elatioris; CSR-strategy; Ecological indicator value; Green  space; Meadow; Vegetation change; Urban ecology; Functional trait; Mesic  grassland; Molinio-Arrhenatheretea; Pasture; Resurvey;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 580","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Vegetation changes in urban grasslands over  years in the city of Zurich, Switzerland; Switzerland; Zurich; Biodiversity; Arrhenatherion elatioris; CSR-strategy; Ecological indicator value; Green  space; Meadow; Vegetation change; Urban ecology; Functional trait; Mesic  grassland; Molinio-Arrhenatheretea; Pasture; Resurvey;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Many studies have demonstrated significant alterations in the species composition of grasslands in Central Europe over the past decades due to multiple drivers of anthropogenic environmental change.

Very elegant and specific mutational mechanisms allow B lymphocytes to produce a large and diversified repertoire of antibodies, which is modified and enhanced throughout all adulthood. One of these mechanisms is somatic hypermutation, which stochastically mutates nucleotides in the antibody genes, forming new sequences with different properties and, eventually, higher affinity and selectivity to the pathogenic target. Since somatic hypermutation involves fast mutation of antibody sequences, this process can be described using a Markov substitution model of molecular evolution. Here, using large sets of antibody sequences from mice and humans, we infer an empirical amino acid substitution model AB, which is specific to antibody sequences. Compared to existing general amino acid models, we show that the AB model provides significantly better description for the somatic evolution of mice and human antibody sequences, as demonstrated on large next generation sequencing (NGS) antibody data. General amino acid models are reflective of conservation at the protein level due to functional constraints, with most frequent amino acids exchanges taking place between residues with the same or similar physicochemical properties. In contrast, within the variable part of antibody sequences we observed an elevated frequency of exchanges between amino acids with distinct physicochemical properties. This is indicative of a sui generis mutational mechanism, specific to antibody somatic hypermutation. We illustrate this property of antibody sequences by a comparative analysis of the network modularity implied by the AB model and general amino acid substitution models.We recommend using the new model for computational studies of antibody sequence maturation, including inference of alignments and phylogenetic trees describing antibody somatic hypermutation in large NGS data sets. The AB model is implemented in the open-source software CodonPhyML (http://sourceforge.net/projects/codonphyml) and can be downloaded and supplied by the user to ProGraphMSA (http://sourceforge.net/projects/prographmsa) or other alignment and phylogeny reconstruction programs that allow for user-defined substitution models.","doc_id":9189,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22885","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Förderung der Biodiversität auf Entwicklungsarealen : Beispiel Hobelwerk, Oberwinterthur","authors":"Manikkan, Mathujah","subject":"Biodiversität; Förderung der Biodiversität; Strukturelemente; Hobelwerk; Oberwinterthur; Standortanalyse;  Gemeinschaften;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"307, 333","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Förderung der Biodiversität auf Entwicklungsarealen : Beispiel Hobelwerk, Oberwinterthur; Biodiversität; Förderung der Biodiversität; Strukturelemente; Hobelwerk; Oberwinterthur; Standortanalyse;  Gemeinschaften;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Angesichts des weltweit ansteigenden Bevölkerungswachstums und der damit verbunden Verdichtung der Städte, steigt der Verlust der Biodiversität. In der Vergangenheit wurden bereits einige Konzepte zur Förderung der Biodiversität im Siedlungsraum entwickelt, um diesem Problem entgegenzuwirken. Siedlungsgebiete weisen aufgrund ihres mosaikartigen Raums Nischen für viele Tier- und Pflanzenarten auf. Die Baugenossenschaft «mehr als wohnen» steht mit der Überbauung des ehemaligen Hobelwerks in Oberwinterthur vor der neuen Herausforderung eine innovative und nachhaltige Siedlung zu entwickeln. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht, wie die Biodiversität auf dem Siedlungsareal «Hobelwerk» gefördert werden kann und wie konkrete Umsetzungsmöglichkeiten dafür aussehen können. In einem ersten Schritt wurde dafür eine Standortanalyse durchgeführt, um einzuschätzen, wie ökologisch die Siedlung geplant wurde. Diese umfasste diverse Abfragen der Wildtierbestände auf dem Areal und in der Umgebung von verschiedenen Datenbanken. Die Freiraumplanung weist eine Vielfalt verschiedener Vegetationstypen und Lebensräume auf. Wildtierbeobachtungen von Mauerseglern, Mehlschwalben, Braunbrustigeln, diverse Schmetterlingsarten, Eidechsenarten und Wildbienen wurden mehrfach protokolliert und demzufolge als Leittierarten für diese Arbeit definiert. Anhand der Bedürfnisse der Leittierarten wurden Möglichkeiten untersucht, um ihnen einen Lebensraum auf dem Areal zu ermöglichen. Als Hauptergebnis konnten sechs Massnahmen zur Förderung der Biodiversität auf dem Areal «Hobelwerk» definiert werden. Die Massnahmen beinhalten die Förderung der Leittierarten mit detaillierten Empfehlungen für Nahrungsangebote sowie Nist- und Unterschlupfmöglichkeiten.Due to the worldwide increase in population growth and the resulting densification of the cities, the loss of biodiversity is on the rise. In the past, several concepts for the enhancing biodiversity in urban areas have been developed in order to counteract this problem. Urban areas have niches for many animal and plant species due to their mosaic-like space. The building cooperative «mehr als wohnen» is faced with the new challenge of developing an innovative and sustainable settlement with the redevelopment of the planning mill in Oberwinterthur. This study examines how biodiversity can be enhanced on the «Hobelwerk» settlement site and how this can be achieved in concrete terms. In a first step, a location analysis was carried out to assess how ecologically the settlement was planned. This included various queries of wildlife populations on the area and in the surroundings from different databases. The ground planning shows a variety of different vegetation types and habitats. Wildlife observations of common swifts, house martins, brown-breasted hedgehogs, various butterfly species, lizard species, and wild bees were recorded several times and accordingly defined as lead species for this thesis. Based on the needs of the lead species, options were investigated to provide a habitat for these species on this area. As a main result, six measures for the promotion of biodiversity on the «Hobelwerk» area were defined. The measures include the encouragement of the leading animal species with detailed recommendations for food offers as well as nesting and sheltering possibilities.","doc_id":9207,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16536","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"How robust is the uniform emissions pricing rule to social equity concerns?","authors":"Abrell, Jan; Rausch, Sebastian; Schwarz, Giacomo A.","subject":"Differentiated environmental tax; Carbon pricing; Climate policy; Heterogeneous household;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"How robust is the uniform emissions pricing rule to social equity concerns?; Differentiated environmental tax; Carbon pricing; Climate policy; Heterogeneous household;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; This paper examines pollution tax differentiation across industries in light of social equity concerns using theoretical and numerical general equilibrium analyses in an optimal tax framework. We characterize the drivers for non-uniform optimal taxes stemming from the interaction of household heterogeneity with social preferences. Quantitatively assessing the case of price-based CO emissions control in the U.S. economy, we find that uniform emissions pricing is approximately optimal when social concerns are defined over inequity induced by the environmental tax. The deviation from uniform emissions pricing, however, becomes non-negligible when pollution tax rebates deviate much from optimal transfer schemes or when social concerns are defined over both policy-induced impacts and inequity unrelated to environmental policy. Our results are robust to a number of model extensions including the stringency of the environmental target, downstream vs. upstream taxation, pre-existing distortionary taxes, and parametric uncertainty in firms’ and households’ equilibrium tax responses.","doc_id":9238,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"43","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1378","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Circular economy : implications for the Swiss fashion retail industry","authors":"Scheibler, Johannes","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Leitendes Management","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"363, 658.4","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Circular economy : implications for the Swiss fashion retail industry;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Leitendes Management; The concept of Circular Economy is much discussed among experts and in sustainably advanced business contexts such as the  Sustainability Summit in London.

Seven green roofs in peri-urban and urban areas in different Swiss cantons (Aargau, Berne, Zoug and Lucerne) where Vanellus vanellus (Northern Lapwing) and Charadrius dubius (Little Ringed Plover) may breed successfully were investigated. In addition, a ground site in an agricultural area was used as a control or reference site. The project had two objectives: first, to improve the vegetation of the roofs using different techniques – seed, hay mulch (fresh and dry) and turf – and, second, to assess the development of the vegetation in relation to improving the breeding success of, and habitat use by, V. vanellus. Because the research project funding ended in July , the data presented in this chapter are from only one of the roof sites (Rotkreuz), which provides a good overview. The data were obtained over three breeding seasons. The initial results suggest that the improvement of green roof habitats using fresh hay mulch produced a vegetation of –% in two seasons, resulting in a remarkable increase in plant biomass. Results also show that V. vanellus has begun to breed consistently, although as yet unsuccessfully on green roofs. The results show that as a consequence of the improvement of the vegetation, the chicks survived – days longer in the second year than in the first year. The study has provided important information about the habitat selection and behaviour of the adult and young birds, which is of value in future urban research and green roof design.","doc_id":9268,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/125","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"Validierung der Schweizer Ammoniak-Immissionskarte 2010","authors":"Locher, René","subject":"Immissionskarte; Luftqualität; Robuste Regression; Meteobereinigung; Adjusting for meteorological effects; Air quality; Map of air pollution; Robust regression;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"363","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Validierung der Schweizer Ammoniak-Immissionskarte ; Immissionskarte; Luftqualität; Robuste Regression; Meteobereinigung; Adjusting for meteorological effects; Air quality; Map of air pollution; Robust regression;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; The efficacy of actions taken in order to reduce the ammonia emissions is monitored by measuring ambient concentrations of ammonia.

A historical scientific debate on the origin of A. septentrionale on erratic boulders – transportation during the ice ages by glaciers on erratic boulders vs. post-glacial long-distance colonization – underlines the importance of those populations for science history. In the present study, a census of A. septentrionale on erratic boulders on the Swiss Plateau and in the Jura region was conducted, since only little is known about the current distribution of these biogeographically remarkable populations. We reviewed herbaria and literature and revisited locations. In total, historical records from  populations were found. Of these, five were confirmed, four were extinct, and the status of eight further populations remained uncertain, because the records were not accurate enough to allow the exact erratic boulders to be found. Two well-documented recent populations in the canton of Zurich showed a decline in population size over the last  years. Only  individuals were found in total. Destruction of erratic boulders for construction and collection for herbaria were significant historical threats, while shading by vegetation and sport climbing (bouldering) are contemporary threats today. On the Swiss Plateau and in the Jura region, regionally rare lichen and bryophyte species unique to siliceous erratic boulders would also profit from conservation measures for A. septentrionale.","doc_id":9368,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22842","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Planerische Anforderungen an Therapiegärten für Menschen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen","authors":"Werder, Marc","subject":"Therapiegarten; Gartentherapie; Natur; Stress; Stressfolgeerkrankung; Psychotherapie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615, 635","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Planerische Anforderungen an Therapiegärten für Menschen mit Stressfolgeerkrankungen; Therapiegarten; Gartentherapie; Natur; Stress; Stressfolgeerkrankung; Psychotherapie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau); Gemäss der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) gilt Stress als eine der Hauptursachen für psychische Krankheiten.

We use ensemble simulations for the period AD - carried out by the coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Chemistry-Climate Model (AOCCM) SOCOL-MPIOM. Firstly, the SOCOL-MPIOM is evaluated using observational and reanalyses datasets. The model is able to realistically simulate the ISMR as well as relevant patterns of sea surface temperature and atmospheric circulation. Further, the influence of Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability on ISMR is realistically simulated. Secondly, we investigate the impact of internal climate variability and external climate forcings on ISMR on decadal to multi-decadal timescales over the past  years. The results show that AMO, PDO, and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) play a considerable role in controlling the wet and dry decades of ISMR. Resembling observational findings most of the dry decades of ISMR occur during a negative phase of AMO and a simultaneous positive phase of PDO. The observational and simulated datasets reveal that on decadal to multi-decadal timescales the ISMR has consistent negative correlation with PDO whereas its correlation with AMO and TSI is not stationary over time.","doc_id":9596,"prior":"sea","sdg14":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19934","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Hydraulic transients and computations","authors":"Zhang, Zhengji","subject":"Hydraulic transient; Water hammer; Hydropower; Characteristics of pumps and turbines; Surge tank; Wave tracking method; Direct computation method; Transient conformity;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Buch","bid":"620","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Hydraulic transients and computations; Hydraulic transient; Water hammer; Hydropower; Characteristics of pumps and turbines; Surge tank; Wave tracking method; Direct computation method; Transient conformity;  Ingenieurwesen; This book describes the fundamental phenomena of, and computational methods for, hydraulic transients, such as the self-stabilization effect, restriction of the Joukowsky equation, real relations between the rigid and elastic water column theories, the role of wave propagation speed, mechanism of the attenuation of pressure fluctuations, etc. A new wave tracking method is described in great detail and, supported by the established conservation and traveling laws of shockwaves, offers a number of advantages.

This dramatic divergence indicates that a comparative analysis may provide valuable insight into these new market dynamics and the bilateral implications for the valuations of both new entrants and the established players. It is within this context that this paper analyzes the market valuations of BMW and Tesla.The first section of the paper focuses on the collection and processing of the necessary data and provides a detailed overview of both companies by means of a SWOT analysis. The underlying methodology for the empirical analysis is the application of two traditional valuation methods, the DCF (discounted cash flow) and the trading multiples method, used to calculate BMW and Tesla’s equity values between  December  and  December . Comparing the obtained equity values to each company’s market capitalization suggests that Tesla is overvalued and BMW is undervalued.The empirical analysis makes up the second part of the paper. It includes an assessment of the findings made in the first section, but exceeds the scope of this quantitative analysis by contextualizing the resulting valuations by means of a qualitative analysis. The aim of this qualitative analysis is to establish a framework with which to extend the valuation process beyond the merits of the two companies’ financial data, where traditional methods generally reach their limits.This qualitative analysis is predicated on an analysis of both the industry and the individual companies. An assessment of the current automotive industry by means of a PESTEL (political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal) analysis contextualizes BMW and Tesla’s valuations as a product of this highly dynamic environment and each company’s ability to identify and capitalize on the emerging trends that are reshaping the industry. The individual analysis of both companies frames the two companies’ valuations within a life-cycle perspective of corporate evolution and analyzes their strategies using different theories including disruptive innovation, blue ocean strategies, and the ten determinants of corporate success (i.e., ten levers). In BMW’s case, this contextualization reinforces the quantitative findings that suggest the group’s market value is undervalued. On the other hand, Tesla’s innovative strategy and position as a first mover within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution lends credence to its high market capitalization.The paper’s findings evince that intangible assets are taking on an increased importance as a consequence of this new and dynamic environment. This has resounding implications on how value is understood, generated, and measured, and suggests that company valuations predicated solely on a firm’s financial data may provide an incomplete picture of their true value.","doc_id":9983,"prior":"ocean","sdg14":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5953","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Navigating towards decoupled aquaponic systems : a system dynamics design approach","authors":"Goddek, Simon; Espinal, Carlos A.; Delaide, Boris; Jijakli, Haissam M.; Schmautz, Zala; Wuertz, Sven; Keesman, Karel J.","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Navigating towards decoupled aquaponic systems : a system dynamics design approach;  Landwirtschaft; The classical working principle of aquaponics is to provide nutrient-rich aquacultural water to a hydroponic plant culture unit, which in turn depurates the water that is returned to the aquaculture tanks. A known drawback is that a compromise away from optimal growing conditions for plants and fish must be achieved to produce both crops and fish in the same environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to develop a theoretical concept of a decoupled aquaponic system (DAPS), and predict water, nutrient (N and P), fish, sludge, and plant levels. This has been approached by developing a dynamic aquaponic system model, using inputs from data found in literature covering the fields of aquaculture, hydroponics, and sludge treatment. The outputs from the model showed the dependency of aquacultural water quality on the hydroponic evapotranspiration rate. This result can be explained by the fact that DAPS is based on one-way flows. These one-way flows results in accumulations of remineralized nutrients in the hydroponic component ensuring optimal conditions for the plants. The study also suggests to size the cultivation area based on P availability in the hydroponic component as P is an exhaustible resource and has been identified one of the main limiting factors for plant growth.","doc_id":10028,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"86","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17799","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Species‐area realationships in continuous vegetation : evidence from Palaearctic grasslands","authors":"Dengler, Jürgen; Biurrun, Idoia; Matthews, Thomas J.; Steinbauer, Manuel J.; Wolfrum, Sebastian; Boch, Steffen; Chiarucci, Alessandro; Conradi, Timo; Dembicz, Iwona; Marcenò, Corrado; García-Mijangos, Itziar; Nowak, Arkadiusz; Storch, David; Ulrich, Werner","subject":" Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"577","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Species‐area realationships in continuous vegetation : evidence from Palaearctic grasslands;  Ökologie; Aim: Species-area relationships (SARs) are fundamental scaling laws in ecology although their shape is still disputed. At larger areas power laws best represent SARs. Yet, it remained unclear whether SARs follow other shapes at finer spatial grains in continuous vegetation. We asked which function describes SARs best at small grains and explored how sampling methodology or the environment influence SAR shape.Location: Palaearctic grasslands and other non-forested habitats.Taxa: Vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens.Methods: We used the GrassPlot database, containing standardised vegetation-plot data from vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens spanning a wide range of grassland types throughout the Palaearctic and including  nested-plot series with at least seven grain sizes ranging from  cm to  m². Using non-linear regression, we assessed the appropriateness of different SAR functions (power, power quadratic, power breakpoint, logarithmic, Michaelis-Menten). Based on AICc, we tested whether the ranking of functions differed among taxa, methodological settings, biomes or vegetation types.Results: The power function was the most suitable function across the studied taxa. The superiority of this function increased from lichens to bryophytes to vascular plants to all three taxa together. The sampling method was highly influential as rooted-presence sampling decreased the performance of the power function. By contrast, biome and vegetation type had practically no influence on the superiority of the power law.Main conclusions: We conclude that SARs of sessile organisms at smaller spatial grains are best approximated by power functions. This coincides with several other comprehensive studies of SARs at different grain sizes and for different taxa, thus supporting the general appropriateness of power functions for modelling species diversity over many grain sizes. The poor performance of the Michaelis-Menten function demonstrates that richness within plant communities generally does not approach any saturation, thus calling to abandon the concept of minimal area.","doc_id":10043,"prior":"species diversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2471","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"UF001 LokDepot, Basel : the first commercial rooftop aquaponic farm in Switzerland","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Durno, Mark; Gaus, Roman; Mathis, Alex; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Building integrated agriculture;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"630","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"UF LokDepot, Basel : the first commercial rooftop aquaponic farm in Switzerland; Aquaponics; Building integrated agriculture;  Landwirtschaft; Introduction: Aquaponics is an innovative and sustainable food production system integrating aquaculture with hydroponic vegetal crops. This emerging technology has the potential to play a key role in provision of food while tackling global challenges such as water scarcity, food safety, food security, urbanization, and reductions in energy use and food miles. While it is a widely discussed technology today (about .m hits on Google in May ), only very few research papers were published describing efficiency and performance of real systems. Results: In , the Swiss company UrbanFarmers, a spin-off of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) built a  m greenhouse farm on an industrial rooftop in Basel (UF ). Together with the research team at ZHAW, the aquaponic farm layout was planned, installed, operated and monitored. In its first year of operations,  kg Tilapia and ’ kg of different vegetables were produced and sold to restaurants, and to Migros, Switzerland’s largest retailer. This pilot farm achieved three major goals: to showcase the proof of technology for aquaponic rooftop farms, to demonstrate proof of market acceptance by Swiss consumers for this new way of farming food, and to deliver key performance figures that allow planning and scale-up for future commercially interesting farm units. Conclusion: Further innovations are required that simplify operations and enable cost-effective aquaponic farming, while making the products safe for human consumption: new planting techniques, new varieties of produce, biological pest control, irrigation techniques, and integration with existing building infrastructures.","doc_id":10147,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"54","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11761","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Bundesgesetz über die Fischerei (BGF) vom 21.

Since then the commission has investigated and enforced antitrust regulations for over  years. The commission is required by law to publish all of the decisions from the conducted investigations into economic misconduct. However, there does not exist an overview over the work done by them. Not even the commission itself has an overview of all their work.This thesis provides such an overview. It includes all the work done by the commission, but focuses mainly on the investigations into economic misconduct. It further analysises the impact different factors have on the outcome of the investigations. There are a multitude of factors which could potentially have an impact on it. There is the report route of the investigation, the type of misconduct, the year in which the decisions was issued and the economic sector the corporation operates in. All of these are likely to have an impact in some way.To analyse the work done by the commission during this time all the publicly available annual reports and issued decisions were collected and put into a data set. To complete the data set outside information was added to all the information from the Competition Commission. This thesis presents and further analysis the collected data.Contrary to expectations the amount of issued decisions each year has not been rising. However, there has been both an upward trend in both the average time it takes the commission to complete an investigation and the amount of pages the published decision has. This could be explained by an increasing complexity. What has changed over the year is the type of the decision the investigation leads up to. In fact, it is the only factor which had a significant impact on the type of decision. For example, investigations after  were far more likely to end in an amicable settlement than at the beginning of the Competition Commission. The analysis further shows the type of economic misconduct does not have an impact on the outcome of the investigation. Corporations who made illegal agreements are nearly as likely to be forced to change their behaviour as corporations who abuse their dominance. The investigations for both are also nearly equally likely to be discontinued. The report route of the case also does not make a significant difference in the outcome of the investigations. The same is true for the economic sector in which the corporation operates in. These results are quite surprising as the general expectation is that different types of misconduct should lead to different results.The next step in evaluating the work done by the Competition Commission would be to compare the findings of this thesis to similar studies of other antitrust agencies around the world. These comparisons would show if there are similarities or differences between the agencies, which could potentially offer new insights into antitrust regulations.","doc_id":10476,"prior":"illegal","sdg14":1},{"id":"100","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15500","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Fish Welfare in Aquakultur, Besatz und Experimenten","authors":"Pietsch-Schmied, Constanze","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"630","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Fish Welfare in Aquakultur, Besatz und Experimenten;  Landwirtschaft","doc_id":10527,"prior":"Aquakultur","sdg14":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1164","date":"2016","language":"de","title":"Altern mit Querschnittlähmung : Wohin führt der Weg?","authors":"Keusen, Patricia","subject":"Querschnittlähmung; Altern; Ergotherapie; Lebensqualität; Betätigungsperformanz;  Ergotherapie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"615.8515","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Altern mit Querschnittlähmung : Wohin führt der Weg?; Querschnittlähmung; Altern; Ergotherapie; Lebensqualität; Betätigungsperformanz;  Ergotherapie; Darstellung des Themas: Eine Querschnittlähmung stellt eine lebenslange Zustandsveränderung eines Menschen dar.

Although this mechanism is reproduced by most general circulation models today, most models still fail in producing an appropriate winter warming pattern in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study ensemble sensitivity experiments were carried out with a coupled atmosphere‐ocean model to assess the influence of different ozone climatologies on the atmospheric dynamics and in particular on the northern hemispheric winter warming. The ensemble experiments were perturbed by a single Tambora‐like eruption. Larger meridional gradients in the lower stratospheric ozone favor the coupling of zonal wind anomalies between the stratosphere and the troposphere after the eruption. The associated sea level pressure, temperature, and precipitation patterns are more pronounced and the northern hemispheric winter warming is highly significant. Conversely, weaker meridional ozone gradients lead to a weaker response of the winter warming and the associated patterns. The differences in the number of stratosphere‐troposphere coupling events between the ensembles experiments indicate a nonlinear response behavior of the dynamics with respect to the ozone and the volcanic forcing.","doc_id":10739,"prior":"sea","sdg14":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14108","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Extension of aquaponic water use for NFT baby-leaf production : mizuna and rocket salad","authors":"Nicoletto, Carlo; Maucieri, Carmelo; Mathis, Alex; Schmautz, Zala; Komives, Tamas; Sambo, Paolo; Junge, Ranka","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Extension of aquaponic water use for NFT baby-leaf production : mizuna and rocket salad;  Landwirtschaft; Aquaponics is a recirculating technology that combines aquaculture with hydroponics. It allows nutrients from fish waste to feed plants and thus saves water and nutrients. However, there is a mismatch between the nutrients provided by the fish waste and plant needs. Because of this, some nutrients, notably N, tend to accumulate in the aquaponic water (APW or AP water). The aim of this study was to investigate how APW, which is depleted of P and K but still rich in N, could be further utilized. APW was used in a mesocosm and compared with APW from the same source that had been supplemented with macro-nutrients (complemented AP water or CAPW) and a hydroponic control (HC). Mizuna (M) and rocket salad (R) were used as short-cycle vegetable crops in a NFT system. The results revealed that the low production potential of APW was mainly caused by the lack of P and K. If these were supplemented, the yields were comparable to those in the HC. M yield in CAPW was significantly higher than that of HC, probably due to biostimulant effects connected to the organic components in the water as a result of fish farming. Water type, cultivation density, and intercropping significantly influenced the qualitative characteristics of the crop in terms of antioxidant compounds and minerals. Nitrate content in vegetables was lower than European regulation limits. The extended use of APW is viable if the missing nutrients are supplemented; this could be a strategy to increase the efficiency of water and nitrogen use, while further reducing environmental impact.","doc_id":10945,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"90","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24273","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"A new shoe sole technology that transfers the ground composition to the sole of the foot : a user experience evaluation","authors":"Sommer, Bettina; Baumgartner, Daniel; Kuster, Roman; Wenger, Michaela; Bauer, Christoph","subject":" Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"610","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"A new shoe sole technology that transfers the ground composition to the sole of the foot : a user experience evaluation;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Introduction: Neither comfortable, shock-absorbing shoes nor minimal shoes do stimulate the mechanoreceptors of the sole of the foot. This lack of stimulation leads to worse proprioception, poor posture and risk of injuries [] A new sole technology is introduced, which transfers the ground composition to the sole of the foot and may provide enough stability through an integrated footbed (Figure).Methods: The stimuli transmitting shoe sole technology is performed mechanically. The shoe sole consists of hard plastic balls, which are pushed towards the sole of the foot due to uneven surfaces (Figure). This technologies’ user experience was evaluated. The tests consisted of a two-week user study that evaluated three shoe sole in daily life as well as a one-hour monitored parcourse evaluating the shoe sole on specific grounds.All participants were healthy with shoe size EU-. The user study included  participants (Ø  years). Additionally,  persons (Ø  years) participated in the parcourse. Questionnaires covered intensity of sensory transmission, general walking comfort and complaints and the effect of the ground composition on comfort. Answering options were on a Likert scale as well as open questions.Results & DiscussionIntensity: Most of the participants rated the stimulus transmission as very or rather strong. Nobody rated it as very weak. In the parcourse, the strongest sensation was on coarse stones and pavement transitions, followed by the forest floor (Figure).Comfort & complaints: The majority perceived the shoe sole as very or rather comfortable. Participants perceived the stimuli strongest in the forefoot, where also most of the complaints occurred. The complaints were reported as tired feet, pain, pressure and burning feet, and occurred roughly every third day.Conclusions: All participants perceived the stimuli transmission of the shoe sole. However, the product polarizes. While some considered the stimuli as comfortable, others found them too strong. The forefoot was the part with the strongest stimuli sensation, but also with the most complaints.","doc_id":11080,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12903","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Stereochemistry of LinB-catalyzed biotransformation of δ-HBCD to 1R,2R,5S,6R,9R,10S-pentabromocyclododecanol","authors":"Heeb, Norbert V.; Zindel, Daniel; Graf, Heidi; Azara, Valeria; Bernd Schweizer, W.; Geueke, Birgit; Kohler, Hans-Peter E.; Lienemann, Peter","subject":"Catalysis; Brominated hydrocarbons; Nucleotidyltransferases; Soil Pollutants; Sphingomonadaceae; Stereoisomerism; Biotransformation;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Stereochemistry of LinB-catalyzed biotransformation of δ-HBCD to R,R,S,R,R,S-pentabromocyclododecanol; Catalysis; Brominated hydrocarbons; Nucleotidyltransferases; Soil Pollutants; Sphingomonadaceae; Stereoisomerism; Biotransformation;  Biochemie; The haloalkane dehalogenase LinB from Sphingobium indicum BA converts β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), the most persistent HCH stereoisomer, to mono- and dihydroxylated metabolites. Recently, we reported that LinB also transforms α-, β- and γ-hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), which are structurally related to HCHs. Here, we show that LinB catalyzes the hydroxylation of δ-HBCD to two pentabromocyclododecanols (PBCDOHs) and two tetrabromocyclododecadiols (TBCDDOHs). The stereochemistry of this enzymatic transformation was deduced from XRD crystal structure data of the substrate δ-HBCD and α()-PBCDOH, one of the biotransformation products. Five stereocenters of δ-HBCD are unchanged but the one at C is converted to an alcohol with inversion from S- to R-configuration in a nucleophilic, S(N)-like substitution reaction. Only α()-PBCDOH with the R,R,S,R,R,S-configuration is obtained but not its enantiomer. With only two of the  PBCDOHs formed, these transformations indeed are regio- and stereoselective. A conformational analysis revealed that the triple-turn motive, which is predominant in δ-HBCD and in several other HBCD stereoisomers, is also found in the product. This shows that LinB preferentially converted reactive bromine atoms but not those in the conserved triple-turn motive. The widespread contamination with HCHs triggered the bacterial evolution of dehalogenases which acquired the ability to convert these pollutants and their metabolites. We here demonstrate that LinB of S. indicum also transforms HBCDs regio- and stereoselectively following a similar mechanism.","doc_id":11115,"prior":"contamination","sdg14":1},{"id":"34","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7341","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Carex sempervirens tussocks induce spatial heterogeneity in litter decomposition, but not in soil properties, in a subalpine grassland in the Central Alps","authors":"Yu, F.-H.; Schütz, Martin; Page-Dumroese, Deborah; Krüsi, Bertil; Schneller, Jakob; Wildi, Otto; Risch, Anita","subject":"Carex sempervirens; Litter decomposition; Swiss National Park;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"580","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Carex sempervirens tussocks induce spatial heterogeneity in litter decomposition, but not in soil properties, in a subalpine grassland in the Central Alps; Carex sempervirens; Litter decomposition; Swiss National Park;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","doc_id":11121,"prior":"litter","sdg14":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1374","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Aus- und Weiterbildung in der Versicherungswirtschaft : Einflussfaktoren für die Studienwahl","authors":"Steiger, Simon","subject":" Arbeitsökonomie;  Hochschulbildung","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"331, 378","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Aus- und Weiterbildung in der Versicherungswirtschaft : Einflussfaktoren für die Studienwahl;  Arbeitsökonomie;  Hochschulbildung; In der Schweizer Volkswirtschaft gehört die Versicherungsindustrie zu den grössten acht Wirtschaftszweigen und leistet einen namhaften Beitrag zur Erhaltung des nationalen Wohlstandes.

In this paper, models are developed to assess how two alternative policy approaches impact a herder’s decisions on carnivore hunting and livestock protection. We find that while the well-established ex-post compensation policy induces suboptimal livestock protection it can generate sufficient incentives for the herder to refrain from hunting so that the carnivore population reaches its socially optimal level. Performance payments are proposed as alternative policy. They are found not to distort livestock protection incentives and can also help achieve a socially optimal carnivore population level.

It aims to serve as an instrument that supports the realization of projects which enhance biodiversity in urban areas. The EAD is based upon the already existing Animal Aided Design (AAD) which focuses on fostering distinct animal species. However, the holistic approach of the EAD also includes biospheres in the planning process. Thereby, a comprehensive analysis of flora and fauna inventories enables to consider connections between species. The increased scope of the EAD in comparison to the AAD results in a superior impact on biodiversity and increases the sustainability of projects fostering biodiversity.","doc_id":11477,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2359","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The effect of anaerobic and aerobic fish sludge supernatant on hydroponic lettuce","authors":"Goddek, Simon; Schmautz, Zala; Scott, Benjamin; Delaide, Boris; Keesman, Karel J.; Wuertz, Sven; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Zee; Oeko; Iunr;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"The effect of anaerobic and aerobic fish sludge supernatant on hydroponic lettuce; Zee; Oeko; Iunr;  Landwirtschaft; The mobilization of nutrients from fish sludge (i.e., feces and uneaten feed) plays a key role in optimizing the resource utilization and thus in improving the sustainability of aquaponic systems. While several studies have documented the aerobic and anaerobic digestion performance of aquaculture sludge, the impact of the digestate on plant growth has yet to be understood. The present study examines the impact of either an aerobic or an anaerobic digestion effluent on lettuce plant growth, by enriching a mixture of aquaculture and tap water with supernatants from both aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors. The lettuce plants grown in the hydroponic system supplied with supernatant from an anaerobic reactor had significantly better performance with respect to weight gain than both, those in the system where supernatant from the aerobic reactor was added, as well as the control system. It can be hypothesized that this effect was caused by the presence of NH+ as well as dissolved organic matter, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and fungi, and humic acid, which are predominantly present in anaerobic effluents.

As the industry grows, the manufacturing processes and the material and energy efficiencies of PV cells and panels are improving. To assess the impacts of this trend, future scenarios of single-crystalline (single-Si, also known as mono-crystalline) silicon and cadmium-telluride (CdTe) PV systems installed on European residences were established. Assessment of the improvement potential of PV electricity-generating technologies such as single-Si and CdTe could be considered in long-term energy strategy decisions.This study aims to provide scenario-based information about the environmental performance of single-Si and CdTe PV modules produced and operated in the far future ( to ). The deployment application assessed considers European residential roofs. We made scenario-dependent projections of key parameters for single-Si and CdTe PV panels manufactured in . The parameters included cell efficiency, module efficiency, wafer thickness, cutting losses, kerf losses, silver use, glass thickness and operational lifetime.This study combines developments for these parameters with projections of the environmental performance of electricity mixes in the main manufacturing countries/regions (European Union, China and the United States of America) and with projections of the environmental performance of basic material production (aluminium, copper, magnesium, nickel, pig iron, zinc, clinker and flat glass) in the far future. The three scenarios used in the assessment of future PV electricity were categorized into three classes: “business as usual” (BAU), “realistic improvement” (REAL) and “optimistic improvement” (OPT).It estimates the current life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of single-Si PV electricity produced on the roofs of European residences to be approximately  grams CO-equivalent per kWh (g CO-eq per kWh).

Aufgrund ihrer Lebensweise als Kulturfolger sind sie allerdings diversen anthropogenen Einflüssen ausgesetzt und es gilt, die Art und ihren Lebensraum auch langfristig zu erhalten. Bei der Umsetzung von Schutz- und Förderungsmassnahmen ist das Wissen über das Beutetierspektrum und den Jagdlebensraum essenziell. Obwohl bereits umfassend erforscht, wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit erstmals mittels Metabarcoding die Nahrungszusammensetzung von Grossen Mausohren aus vier Wochenstuben ermittelt. Anhand der Klassifikation der Beutetiere in Waldund Offenlandarten wurde ausserdem untersucht, inwiefern sich daraus eine Nutzung der Jagdlebensräume ableiten lässt. Obwohl sich auf Basis von Next Generation Sequencing- Daten keine quantitativen Aussagen machen lassen, stimmte ein Grossteil der Ergebnisse mit dem bisherigen Kenntnisstand überein.Es konnten insgesamt  Beutetierarten ermittelt werden. Dabei handelte es sich ausschliesslich um Arthropoda (Gliederfüsser), deren waldbewohnenden Arten in allen Wochenstuben den Hauptbestandteil der Nahrungszusammensetzung ausmachten. Offenlandbewohnende Arten spielten hingegen nur temporär eine grössere Rolle. Somit kann bestätig werden, dass dem Wald als Jagdlebensraum für das Grosse Mausohr eine besondere Bedeutung zukommt. Offenlandschaften werden vermutlich nur dann als Jagdlebensraum genutzt, wenn Beutetiere in grösserer Zahl darin vorkommen. Erwartungsgemäss machten Arten der Ordnung Coleoptera einen Hauptbestandteil des Nahrungsspektrums aus. Lepidoptera konnten ebenfalls häufig nachgewiesen werden, während die Orthoptera und Hymenoptera je nach Wochenstube von unterschiedlicher, aber untergeordneter Wichtigkeit waren.The population of the Greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) in Switzerland is estimated to be around ' individuals and their status is currently stable. As a synanthropic species, however, they are exposed to various anthropogenic influences and it is crucial to preserve the species and its habitat in the long term. Knowledge on their prey spectrum and hunting grounds is therefore essential for implementation of conservation measures. Although already extensively researched, the present study was the first to determine the food composition of the Greater mouse-eared bat in such detail by using metabarcoding techniques. By classifying the prey species according to their preferred habitat, either forest or open land, it was also investigated if conclusions can be drawn about the use of these two hunting grounds. Although quantitative statements are difficult do make based on next generation sequencing data most results were consistent with the current state of knowledge.A total of  prey species were identified.The prey was exclusively arthropods, whose forestdwelling species formed the main part of the food composition in all studied maternity-roosts of the Greater mouse-eared bat. Prey species living in the open country only temporarily played a major role. Thus, it can be confirmed that the forest is of special importance as a hunting ground for the Greater mouse-eared bat. Most likely open landscapes are only used as a hunting ground if prey species are present in large numbers. As expected, species of the order Coleoptera were a major component of the prey spectrum. Lepidoptera were also frequently found, while Orthoptera and Hymenoptera were of varying but minor importance depending on the time of the season the sample was taken and the maternity roost.","doc_id":11676,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17819","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"A qualitative multi-criteria, multi stakeholder decision making tool for sustainable waste management","authors":"Khalili, Nasrin R.; Ehrlich, David; Dia-Eddine, Khaldoun","subject":"CBL; Cigarette butt litter; Environmental management; Environmental policy; LCSA; Llife cycle sustainability assessment; Multi criteria decision model; Multi-stakeholder approach; Qualitative models; Tobacco industry;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"A qualitative multi-criteria, multi stakeholder decision making tool for sustainable waste management; CBL; Cigarette butt litter; Environmental management; Environmental policy; LCSA; Llife cycle sustainability assessment; Multi criteria decision model; Multi-stakeholder approach; Qualitative models; Tobacco industry;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Environmental sustainability is a concept, a vision for business, government, and the society, a goal to be achieved, and a strategy to guide and organise efforts toward more sustainable economic development.

Yet despite its popularity, little is known about the reasons why people feed wild birds, especially raptors. Although bird feeding can have a positive impact on both the birds and the people feeding them, there are also undesirable side effects. Increasing complaints from neighbours of such feeding sites in recent years have shown that there is an existing conflict. So far, there is only little knowledge about the negative effects that feeding sites can have on surrounding neighbours and what factors influence whether a person feels disturbed by the feeding or not. Our study aimed to explore the motivations behind red kite feeding, which represents an increasing trend in Switzerland. By interviewing  people who regularly feed red kites, we found that pleasure, connecting with nature and the desire to nurture are the main reasons why people provide food for red kites in several Swiss regions. The further objective of this study was to analyse the disturbing factors for people living near these feeding sites in detail with a mixed methods approach. First, eight people living close to feeding sites were interviewed to explore their attitudes and concerns towards the red kite feeding. The information gained from the semi-structured interviews served to develop a questionnaire, which was used to survey  people during the following quantitative stage. Analysing the responses, we found several disturbing factors that can result from feeding sites, with noise pollution, food waste and bird excrements being the most important ones. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between the people providing food for birds and their neighbour determines how that person perceives the feeding. Understanding value orientations and attitudes of stakeholders involved in such a conflict is crucial for developing solutions and compromises. By highlighting the attitudes and motivations of both feeders and their neighbours, our study facilitates future conflict management.","doc_id":11717,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12270","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Biocontrol of Salmonella Typhimurium in RTE foods with the virulent bacteriophage FO1-E2","authors":"Guenther, Susanne; Herzig, Oliver; Fieseler, Lars; Klumpp, Jochen; Loessner, Martin J.","subject":"Disinfection; Food contamination; Public health; Salmonella; Salmonella food poisoning; Salmonella phages; Virulence; Food microbiology; Salmonella typhimurium;  Biologie;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570, 664","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Biocontrol of Salmonella Typhimurium in RTE foods with the virulent bacteriophage FO-E; Disinfection; Food contamination; Public health; Salmonella; Salmonella food poisoning; Salmonella phages; Virulence; Food microbiology; Salmonella typhimurium;  Biologie;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; Foodborne Salmonella infections are a major public health concern worldwide.

Phage particles retained their infectivity, although they were readily immobilized by the food matrix, resulting in loss of their ability to diffuse and infect target cells. At the end of the incubation period, phage-resistant Salmonella strains appeared which, however, were not able to compensate for the initial killing effect.

In this study, we examined plant responses to simulated red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) grazing using clip-plot experiments in a subalpine grassland ecosystem of the Central European Alps. We measured aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and phosphorus (P) concentration of leaf tissue from plants of two vegetation types with different grazing history. The experimental plots were placed on a soil-P gradient and subject to two different clipping treatments, which simulated moderate and heavy grazing, respectively. We found distinct differences in the response of both ANPP and P concentration in leaf tissues in the two vegetation types.Compared to moderate, heavy grazing simulation did not affect ANPP in the vegetation type adapted to grazing, but decreased ANPP in the non-grazing adapted vegetation type. High soil-P levels also had different effects on the response of the vegetation to clipping in the two vegetation types with different grazing history. ANPP correlated positively with soil-P in non-grazing adapted tall-grass vegetation, while in grazing adapted short-grass vegetation a positive relationship between soil-P and the P concentration in leaf tissues was found.

Despite its origins in the s, ecological engineering remains a niche discipline, while at the same time, there has never been a greater need to combine the rigour of engineering and science with the systems-approach of ecology for pro-active management of Earth’s biodiversity and environmental life-support systems. Broad consensus on the scope and defining elements of ecological engineering and development of a globally consistent ecological engineering curriculum are key pillars to mainstream recognition of the discipline and practice of ecological engineering.The Importance of Ecological Engineering in Society: In this paper, the importance of ecological engineering education is discussed in relation to the perceived need of our society to address global challenges of sustainable development. The perceived needs of industry, practitioners, educators and students for skills in ecological engineering are also discussed.The Importance and Need for Ecological Engineering Education: The need for integrative, interdisciplinary education is discussed in relation to the scope of ecology, engineering and the unique role of ecological engineering.Scope for a Universally Recognised Curriculum in Ecological Engineering: The scope for a universally recognised curriculum in ecological engineering is presented. The curriculum recognises a set of overarching principles and concepts that unite multiple application areas of ecological engineering practice. The integrative, systems-based approach of ecological engineering distinguishes it from the trend toward narrow specialisation in education. It is argued that the systems approach to conceptualising problems of design incorporating ecological principles is a central tenant of ecological engineering practice.Challenges to Wider Adoption of Ecological Engineering and Opportunities to Increase Adoption: Challenges and structural barriers to wider adoption of ecological engineering principles, embedded in our society’s reliance on technological solutions to environmental problems, are discussed along with opportunities to increase adoption of ecological engineering practice. It is suggested that unifying the numerous specialist activity areas and applications of ecological engineering under an umbrella encompassing a set of core principles, approaches, tools and way of thinking is required to distinguish ecological engineering from other engineering disciplines and scale up implementation of the discipline. It is concluded that these challenges can only be realised if ecological engineering moves beyond application by a relatively small band of enthusiastic practitioners, learning by doing, to the education of future cohorts of students who will become tomorrow’s engineers, project managers, procurement officers and decision makers, applying principles informed by a growing body of theory and knowledge generated by an active research community, a need whose time has come, if we are to deploy all tools at our disposal toward addressing the grand challenge of creating a sustainable future.","doc_id":12114,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6508","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"High-throughput identification of the microbial biodiversity of cocoa bean fermentation by MALDI-TOF MS","authors":"Miescher Schwenninger, Susanne; Freimüller Leischtfeld, Susette; Gantenbein-Demarchi, Corinne","subject":"Lactic acid bacteria; MALDI-TOF MS; Acetic acid bacteria; Cocoa bean fermentation;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"664","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"High-throughput identification of the microbial biodiversity of cocoa bean fermentation by MALDI-TOF MS; Lactic acid bacteria; MALDI-TOF MS; Acetic acid bacteria; Cocoa bean fermentation;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry(MALDI-TOF MS) is a powerful biotyping tool increasingly used for high- throughput identiﬁcation of clinical microbial isolates, however, in food fermentation research this approach is still not well established.

Nach initialer Bereinigung und Implementierung der Daten in R konnte eine App erstellt werden, welche einfache graphische Analysen des erwähnten Datensatzes ohne jegliche Programmierkenntnisse erlaubt. Nach einer kurzen Vorstellung des Programmiercodes der App wurden mithilfe der Shiny-App zwei Hypothesen aufgestellt und überprüft. Es konnte eine starke Korrelation (R-Wert = ., Methode Pearson) zwischen der gemessenen Raumtemperatur im Anlagenraum und der Leistung der Wärmepumpe, welche mittels Wärmetauscher die Wassertemperatur reguliert, nachgewiesen werden. Bei der zweiten Hypothese wurde eine negative Korrelation zwischen der Frischwasserzufuhr und der gemessenen NOx-Konzentration erwartet.

Vegetation plots record the occurrence or abundance of all plant species co-occurring within delimited local areas. This allows species absences to be inferred, information seldom provided by existing global plant datasets. Although many vegetation plots have been recorded, most are not available to the global research community. A recent initiative, called ‘sPlot’, compiled the first global vegetation plot database, and continues to grow and curate it. The sPlot database, however, is extremely unbalanced spatially and environmentally, and is not open-access. Here, we address both these issues by (a) resampling the vegetation plots using several environmental variables as sampling strata and (b) securing permission from data holders of  local-to-regional datasets to openly release data.

Thrombus formation and chronic inflammation are integral to disease progression, driven by blood flow energy. The interplay between flow energy, blood clotting and remodeling of the tissue is key to an enhanced disease understanding, to improve patient counseling and ultimately endovascular treatment planning. Current concepts suggest that blood governs wall remodeling by multiple biological steps. The process starts with flow induced thrombus adhesion (atherothrombosis) to the wall that secondarily leads to the release of biological mediators of inflammation entertaining destructive remodeling. Destructive wall remodeling jeopardizes the mechanical wall integrity with ensuing circumscribed softening and expansion of the aneurysm shape. The shape of an aneurysm is the visible result of these complex pathological processes and characterizes its disease status. Wall adherent thrombus formation, inflammatory reactions and the driving force of blood flow cause lumen shape changes. Here, shape irregularity is a distinctive sign of focal wall weakening. The integration of shape-analysis,vascular biology and phenotypical information will allow for personalized characterization of aneurysmal vascular disease and help to identify and establish shape as an image-based biomarker. Future translational efforts should aim at providing adequate IT tools and contributing to validation and disease understanding. Ensuing results will have a high likelihood to impact significantly on current clinical disease management.","doc_id":12662,"prior":"destructive","sdg14":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8144","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Pregnancies in liver and kidney transplant recipients : a review of the current literature and recommendation","authors":"Blume, C.; Pischke, S.; von Versen-Höynck, F.; Günter, H.H.; Gross, Mechthild Maria","subject":"Bone density conservation agents; Evidence-based medicine; Practice guidelines as topic; Pregnancy complications; Pregnancy outcome; Risk factor; Trace element; Transplant recipient; Vitamin D; Immunosuppression; Kidney transplantation; Liver transplantation;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Pregnancies in liver and kidney transplant recipients : a review of the current literature and recommendation; Bone density conservation agents; Evidence-based medicine; Practice guidelines as topic; Pregnancy complications; Pregnancy outcome; Risk factor; Trace element; Transplant recipient; Vitamin D; Immunosuppression; Kidney transplantation; Liver transplantation;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; In this article, we focus on the biggest groups of organ transplant recipients, patients with a kidney or liver graft. Among these patients, about one sixth included women of childbearing potential. Therefore, the wish of getting pregnant is frequent in these peculiar patients, and careful planning and management of the pregnancies requires the expertise of obstetricians, midwives and transplant experts. Altogether, the outcome of the pregnancies in these women is acceptable. About % off all pregnancies ended successfully with live births, and this is comparable if not superior to pregnancies in healthy women. This success might be caused not only by the special and intensive care provided to these high-risk pregnancies by the transplant centres but also by the low rate of unplanned pregnancies. The risk of rejections and organ loss after delivery is about %, and it is slightly enhanced in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) in comparison to kidney graft recipients (KTRs) but the number of organ losses in direct association with a pregnancy is rare. However, there is not only a higher frequency of pregnancy-associated disorders such as pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery but also an acceleration of hypertension, new-onset diabetes mellitus and newly arising infections also favoured by the maintained immunosuppressive therapy. This implies a specialized 'control system' for these pregnant women that comprises ultrasound and Doppler investigation for risk assessment, infection screening, suitable therapy and the choice of non-teratogenic immunosuppressives. Antihypertensive treatment must be well balanced and adjusted to the possible growth-retarding effect on the foetus as well as on the co-morbidity of the mother. Finally, supplementation of vitamin D and iron is much more important in these transplanted women than in healthy pregnant women as vitamin D deficiency and anaemia are discussed to have an impact on pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery.

Due to the small distances between the mechanical supporting elements which prevent the dishing of the laminate, the stiffness of the laminate itself can be reduced to a minimum. This enables the use of thin glass or alternative materials such as polymer foils.

Clean technologies, such as renewable energies, have the potential to significantly reduce these environmental repercussions of agriculture. Countries like South Africa have a coal intensive electricity mix, as well as high solar irradiation and a dry climate which is why agricultural crops are produced under fossil energy intensive irrigation. At the same time, the high solar irradiation could be used for the generation of photovoltaic electricity as a renewable power supply for irrigation. A joint research project between the University of Cape Town and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences quantified the environmental impacts of South African maize production (Zea mays) and the improvement potential of maize irrigation with photovoltaic electricity by means of life cycle assessment (LCA).The LCA includes the whole value chain of maize production from cultivation to storage in a silo for six months, respectively with a functional unit of one kilogram of maize at silo storage produced either on dry land or under irrigation. Electricity consumption for irrigation was identified as an environmental hotspot in the impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions from maize production. Therefore, clean electricity would be the starting point to reduce the carbon footprint of South Africa’s maize. We calculated that replacement of South African electricity mix with photovoltaic electricity in the maize irrigation can reduce environmental impacts by up to %. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of maize on dry land without irrigation, under irrigation and under irrigation using photovoltaic electricity, are . kg CO-eq. and . kg CO-eq. and . kg CO-eq., respectively, with a potential reduction of % if the electricity is supplied from photovoltaics compared to the conventional fossil electricity mix. The analysis of further indicators reveals a reduction for non-renewable energy demand (nuclear and fossil), acidification, freshwater eutrophication and human toxicity of carcinogenic substances. The irrigation of a maize field of one hectare consumes ' kWh of electricity per year, which, in turn, requires a solar power plant with an area of  m. We computed that a total area of  ha of solar panels would suffice to produce the total electricity requirement of the current maize production area under irrigation. This corresponds to more than approximately ' t CO-eq. saved per year.Compared to data representing maize production in the United States and in Switzerland, South African maize production has a higher global warming potential per kilogram of maize due to lower yields in South Africa.The replacement of the South African electricity mix in the irrigation with electricity from photovoltaics has proven to be an effective clean technology to reduce environmental impacts associated with maize production in South Africa. Compared to the irrigated field area, land use for PV panels is almost negligible and is therefore no limiting factor in the implementation of irrigation using photovoltaic electricity.","doc_id":12771,"prior":"acidification","sdg14":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3739","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Where does the oxygen go? : kLa measurement in bioreactors","authors":"Backoff, Tobias; Malig, Jennifer; Sören, Werner; Eibl, Dieter; John, Gernot T.","subject":" Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"660","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Where does the oxygen go? : kLa measurement in bioreactors;  Technische Chemie; Small plastic tubes are available as single-use bioreactors for cell cultivation as a cost effective alternative to larger scale cultivation systems.

Even though hydropower is often seen as “green energy”, it creates several negative impacts on riverine systems. In order to produce energy, river water is abstracted and released, leading to hydropeaking and residual flow sections, both representing a major disturbance on the natural functions and dynamics of a river. The ecological impact of hydropower production on riverine systems has been extensively investigated, however, mostly focusing on structural aspects. The present study focused on the microbial diversity and community structure in three hydrologically different floodplain sections, two impacted by hydropower and one in a natural reference system.Abiotic characteristics of habitats and genetic fingerprinting (T-RFLP) of the microbial communities were used to assess differences and similarities between and within these regimes. Within the latters we investigated sediments of seven different floodplain habitat types over a sampling period of one and a half year (summer  until autumn ) consisting of six sampling seasons. Six abiotic parameters (temperature, water content, total organic matter, total nitrogen, total carbon and grain size distribution) were used to analyse patterns amongst habitats, regimes and seasons. Organic matter, water content, total nitrogen and total carbon content showed significant differences between the habitats whereas of the regimes the hydropeaking showed relevant influences on abiotic factors. Furthermore, we could illustrate several relationships between abiotic factors and microbial diversity, mainly within the same habitats and regimes as the distinct abiotic properties were highlighted. While the microbial communities clearly differ between aquatic and terrestrial habitats as well as between seasons, there are little differences among the regimes.Linking abiotic characteristics, shaped by the hydrological regimes, to microbial diversity and community structure allows the consideration of the latter as possible indicators of disturbances in river systems. The use of the genetic fingerprinting technique (T-RFLP) proved to be an appropriate method to gain first insights into patterns of microbial diversity and communities. In this context, the results from this study are a first contribution towards assessments of disturbances by microbial diversity and community analysis and possibly to a future development of a functional indicator for disturbance.","doc_id":13129,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"86","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20966","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Seven decades of hydrogeomorphological changes in a near‐natural (Sense River) and a hydropower‐regulated (Sarine River) pre‐Alpine river floodplain in Western Switzerland","authors":"Tonolla, Diego; Geilhausen, Martin; Döring, Michael","subject":"Hydropower impacts; River and floodplain restoration; Altered flow and sediment regime; Aerial image analyses; Geomorphic changes; Active floodplain;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333, 551","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Seven decades of hydrogeomorphological changes in a near‐natural (Sense River) and a hydropower‐regulated (Sarine River) pre‐Alpine river floodplain in Western Switzerland; Hydropower impacts; River and floodplain restoration; Altered flow and sediment regime; Aerial image analyses; Geomorphic changes; Active floodplain;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Geologie und Hydrologie; This is the peer reviewed version which has been published in final form at https://doi.org/./esp. . This article may be used for non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Use of Self-Archived Versions.; Hydropower alteration of the natural flow and sediment regime can severely degrade hydromorphology, thereby threatening biodiversity and overall ecosystem processes of rivers and their floodplains. Using sequences of aerial images, we quantified seven decades (/–) of spatiotemporal changes in channel and floodplain morphology, as well as changes in the physical habitats, of three floodplain river reaches of the Swiss pre‐Alps, two hydropower‐regulated and one near‐natural. In the Sarine River floodplain, within the first decades of hydropower impairment, the magnitude and frequency of flood events (Q, Q, Q) decreased substantially. As a result, the area of pioneer floodplain habitats that depend on flood activity and sediment dynamic, such as bare sediments, decreased dramatically by approximately %. However, by  vegetated areas had generally increased in comparison to the pre‐regulation period in , indicating general vegetative colonization. Between  and , the active channel underwent essential narrowing (up to % width reduction in the residual flow reach) and habitat turnover rates were very low (% of the total floodplain area changed habitat type five to six times). In contrast, from the s onwards, the near‐natural floodplain of the Sense River experienced recurrent narrowing and widening, and frequent changes between bare and vegetated areas, reflecting the shifting habitat mosaic concept typical for natural floodplains. In the three reaches investigated, we found that the active floodplain width and erosion of vegetated areas were primarily controlled by medium to large floods (Q, Q), which combined with reduced time intervals between ordinary floods ≥ Q most likely mobilized streambed sediments and limited the ability of vegetation to establish itself on bare gravel bars within the parafluvial zone. These findings can contribute to restoration action plans such as controlled flooding and sediment replenishments in the Sarine and other floodplain rivers of the Alps.","doc_id":13161,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"8","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12344","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Ultraviolet/ozone treatment to reduce metal-graphene contact resistance","authors":"Li, Wei; Liang, Yiran; Yu, Dangmin; Peng, Lianmao; Pernstich, Kurt; Shen, Tian; Hight Walker, A.

To study the large-scale relationship between the distribution of distinct habitat patches and the occurrence of the threatened Western Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, we developed a patch occupancy model for the species in the Swiss Alps. Thereto, we first confirmed the existence of a local population for % of the patches in the field. Logistic regression was then used to predict patch occupancy as a function of patch area, isolation, connectivity, relative altitude and biogeographic region. The probability of a patch being occupied increased with patch size and increasing altitude, and decreased with increasing distance to the next occupied patch. A sensitivity analysis revealed that patch size and isolation were the most and second most important predictors of the model, respectively.

Numerous studies on the impact of climbing on rock-dwelling plants have reported negative effects, which were mainly attributed to mechanical disturbances such as trampling and removal of soil and vegetation. However, climbers also use climbing chalk (magnesium carbonate hydroxide) whose potential chemical effects on rock-dwelling species have not been assessed so far. Climbing chalk is expected to alter the pH and nutrient conditions on rocks, which may affect rock-dwelling organisms. We elucidated two fundamental aspects of climbing chalk. (a) Its distribution along nonoverhanging climbing routes was measured on regularly spaced raster points on gneiss boulders used for bouldering (ropeless climbing at low height). These measurements revealed elevated climbing chalk levels even on % of sampling points without any visual traces of climbing chalk.

The experiment showed significant negative, though varied effects of elevated climbing chalk concentrations on the germination and survival of both ferns and mosses.

Der Hauptanteil des Fischmehls, welches ungefähr - % des Fischfutters ausmacht, wird durch marine Ressourcen abgedeckt, was nicht nachhaltig ist. Ein wichtiger Inhaltsstoff in Fischmehl und Fischöl sind mehrfach ungesättigte Fettsäuren (PUFAs), welche schwierig zu ersetzten sind. Docosahexaensäure (DHA), Eicosapentaensäure (EPA) und Arachidonsäure (ARA) sind für die Fische die wichtigsten PUFAs. Mikroalgen, welche auch in der natürlichen Nahrungskette die Produzenten für PUFAs sind, scheinen eine gute Möglichkeit zu sein um Fischmehl und Fischöl zu ersetzten. Ein zeitaufwändiger und kostspieliger Teil der Aquakultur ist die Aufzucht von Fischlarven. Einerseits ist die Mortalität hoch und andererseits ist die Fütterung aufwändig, da meist Lebendfutter verwendet wird. In dieser Masterarbeit soll ein mikroalgenhaltiges Fischfutter für Fischlarven entwickelt werden, welches das Lebendfutter ersetzten soll. Um ein solches Futter zu testen, sollte eine bekannte und einfach zu haltende Fischart gewählt werden. Tilapien mit ihrer hohen Wachstumsrate und ihrer grossen Toleranz gegenüber hohen Wassertemperaturen und tiefer Wasserqualität bieten sich als Testorganismus an. Ein weiterer Vorteil ist, dass Tilapien omnivor ernährt werden können.Geeignete Algen wurden aufgrund ihres Gehalts an PUFAs (DHA, EPA und ARA) ausgewählt. Nach der Kultivierung im Labor wurden die drei Algen Nannochloropsis gaditana, Porphyridium sordidum und Isochrysis galbana für die Produktion ausgewählt. Die Algen wurden in Hängeschläuchen produziert. Weil I. galbana nicht genügend wuchs, wurde diese Alge gekauft. Nach der Ernte wurden die Algen gefriertrocknet und zu Algenpulver verarbeitet. Mit einem Futterrechner wurden drei verschiedene Futter mit gleichen Anteilen an Hauptnährstoffen formuliert: Ein Futter ohne Algen (Kontrolle) und zwei Futter mit je zwei Algen (Porph/Nanno:  % P. sordidum und  % N. gaditana; Iso/Nanno:  % Isochrysis sp. und  % N. gaditana). Das Futter wurde mit einem Spaghetti-Extruder pelletiert. Es wurden drei Pellet-Grössen hergestellt. Es wurde ein neunwöchiges Fütterungsexperiment mit Tilapia-Larven mit einem Startgewicht von . g durchgeführt. Nach sechs Wochen und am Ende des Experiments wurden alle Fische gewogen. Wenige Fische wurden für weitere Analysen wie Längenmessung, Entnahme von Leber und Milz oder für Nährstoffanalysen verwendet.Mit . mg/L pro Tag wuchs N. gaditana besser als P. sordidum (. mg/L pro Tag). Von N. gaditana konnten  g Biomasse und von P. sordidum  g produziert werden. Der Gehalt an EPA war bei N. gaditana bei . % der TS, bei P. sordidum war der Gehalt an ARA unter der Nachweisgrenze. Isochrysis sp. hatte einen DHA-Gehalt von . % TS. Mit der Zugabe der Algen zum Porph/Nanno Futter konnte das Fischmehl um . % und das Fischöl um . % reduziert werden. Beim Iso/Nanno Futter waren es . % Fischmehl und . % Fischöl, die ersetzt werden konnten. Die Fische, welche mit den Algenfuttern gefüttert wurden, zeigten ein signifikant besseres Wachstum als die Fische in der Kontrolle. Dies zeigte sich in den Endgewichten, den Standardlängen, den höheren Wachstumsraten und den tieferen Food Conversion Ratios. Keinen Einfluss hatten die Algenfutter auf den Korpulenz-Faktor, den hepatosomatischen Index und die Filetfarbe, sowie auf die Anzahl Fische, die gestorben sind. Der spleenosomatische Index war bei den Fischen, welche das Algenfutter frassen, erhöht. Zudem hatten die Fische mit dem Algenfutter einen höheren Körper-Lipidgehalt als die Fische in der Kontrolle.Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich alle drei Algen als Futterzusatz eignen. Weiterführend könnte versucht werden, das Wachstum der Algen sowie die PUFA Produktion durch Optimierung des Reaktors und den Kulturbedingungen zu erhöhen. Die  % Algen im Fischfutter hatten einen positiven Effekt auf das Wachstum der Fische. Die Resultate des Fütterungsversuchs sind vielversprechend, dass höhere Anteile von Fischmehl und -öl im Fischfutter ersetzt werden könnten.","doc_id":13594,"prior":"Aquakultur","sdg14":1},{"id":"60","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/126","date":"2015","language":"de","title":"NOx-Immissionsbelastung entlang der A2 in den Alpen und im Mittelland : Fallbeispiele Erstfeld und Reiden","authors":"Locher, René","subject":"Luftqualität; Räumlich-zeitliche Verteilung; Gam; Robuste Regression; Air quality; Gam; Robust regression; Temporal spatial distribution;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"363","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"NOx-Immissionsbelastung entlang der A in den Alpen und im Mittelland : Fallbeispiele Erstfeld und Reiden; Luftqualität; Räumlich-zeitliche Verteilung; Gam; Robuste Regression; Air quality; Gam; Robust regression; Temporal spatial distribution;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; The report discusses temporal and spatial distribution of ambient concentration of NO in a valley in the alps, which is strongly affected by the transalpine traffic.

These most speciesrich habitats are threatened due to intensification of agriculture, eutrophication, dereliction, climate change and landscape fragmentation. As a result, the vegetation of semi‐dry grasslands is changing and shows a trend towards homogenization. Specialized species are particularly endangered because their growth conditions are no longer met due to eutrophication and fragmentation. However, only a few studies have so far found that nutrient enrichment also leads to a decline in the species richness. Especially in the calcareous region of the Swiss Jura, the state of knowledge regarding the impact of eutrophication on semi‐dry grasslands is still poor. By performing a resurvey, it has been investigated whether the vegetation change in this region is in line with the general trend in Western Europe. Abundance, species diversity,  different ecological indicator, four functional traits, diagnostic species were analyzed. A habitat classification and decentered correspondence analysis were also performed. Species diversity, light availability, temperature, seed dispersal by animals and seed persistence are all ecological indicator values that have significantly decreased in . Conversely, nutrient availability, soil moisture, seed mass, specific leaf area and canopy height have increased. There are significantly fewer ruderal species, stress‐tolerant species, therophytes and herbaceous chamaephytes in . Highly competitive species and hemicryptophytes, on the contrary, have increased.

However, their application in catalyst production has been largely neglected. Herein, we present the development of a microreactor process for the one-step sol–gel preparation of phosphated TiO – a catalyst which has been recently demonstrated to be an eco-friendly material for the selective synthesis of the platform chemical -hydroxymethylfurfural (-HMF) from bio-derived glucose. In order to establish catalyst preparation–property–performance relationships,  samples were prepared according to a D-optimal experimental plan with a central point. The key properties of these samples (porosity, crystallite size, mole bulk fraction of P) were correlated, using quadratic and interaction models, with the catalytic performance (conversion, selectivity, reaction rate) of -HMF synthesis as a test reaction. The optimal calculated catalyst features were set as target parameters to optimise catalyst synthesis applying quadratic correlation functions. An optimal catalyst was obtained, validating the models employed, with a yield of almost % and a space–time yield of ca.  orders of magnitude higher than that of a conventional batch process. The high yield could be mainly attributed to the optimal hydrolysis ratio and temperature. Controlling the TiO crystallite size and surface acidity in conjunction with fine-tuning of the porous properties in the microreactor led to increased glucose conversion, surface based formation rates of -HMF, and selectivity towards -HMF of the optimal catalyst in relation to the batch-prepared material.","doc_id":13727,"prior":"acidity","sdg14":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2656","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Aquakultur Otelfingen : eine biologische Kläranlage zur Produktion von Biomasse","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Junge, Ranka; Mathis, Alex","subject":"Pilot plant; Wastewater-fed aquaculture; Vegetables; Horssol;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"630","year":"2000","for_data_analysis":"Aquakultur Otelfingen : eine biologische Kläranlage zur Produktion von Biomasse; Pilot plant; Wastewater-fed aquaculture; Vegetables; Horssol;  Landwirtschaft","doc_id":13764,"prior":"Aquakultur","sdg14":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2656","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Aquakultur Otelfingen : eine biologische Kläranlage zur Produktion von Biomasse","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Junge, Ranka; Mathis, Alex","subject":"Pilot plant; Wastewater-fed aquaculture; Vegetables; Horssol;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"630","year":"2000","for_data_analysis":"Aquakultur Otelfingen : eine biologische Kläranlage zur Produktion von Biomasse; Pilot plant; Wastewater-fed aquaculture; Vegetables; Horssol;  Landwirtschaft","doc_id":13764,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1272","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Risk management of water systems in residential homes : The ‘process’ of Legionella prevention","authors":"Leiblein, Thomas W.; Füchslin, Hans Peter; Keserue, Hans Anton; Tucker, Matthew; Hofer, Susanne","subject":"Risk management; Process; prevention; Water system; Legionella;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Facility Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"363, 658.2","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Risk management of water systems in residential homes : The ‘process’ of Legionella prevention; Risk management; Process; prevention; Water system; Legionella;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Facility Management; In the present study data was collect and analysed to gain evidence for the present situation of Legionella risk management and prevention of water systems in different buildings in theCanton of Zurich, Switzerland.

Although emerging low-power wireless communication techniques allow efficient data transfers with great above-ground performance, for underground or indoor applications in a large coverage range are difficult to achieve due to physical and topological limitations, particularly in dense urban areas. In this paper, we first discuss the range limitations of the LoRaWAN standard based on a systematic evaluation of a long-term operation of a sensor network monitoring in-sewer process dynamics. Analyses reveal an-on average-five-fold higher data packet loss for sub-surface nodes, which steadily grows with increasing distance to the gateway. Second, we present a novel LPWAN concept based on the LoRa technology that enhances transmission reliability, efficiency, and flexibility in range-critical situations through meshed multi-hop routing and ensures a precise time-synchronization through optional GPS or DCF long-wave time signaling. Third, we illustrate the usefulness of the newly developed concept by evaluating the radio transmission performance for two independent full-scale field tests. Test results show that the synchronous LoRa mesh network approach clearly outperforms the standard LoRaWAN technique with regard to the reliability of packet delivery when transmitting from range-critical locations. Hence, the approach is expected to generally ease data collection from difficult-to-access locations such as underground areas.","doc_id":13945,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19499","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Comparing the environmental impacts of meatless and meat-containing meals in the United States","authors":"Ernstoff, Alexi; Tu, Qingshi; Faist, Mireille; Del Duce, Andrea; Mandlebaum, Sarah; Dettling, Jon","subject":"Diet; Life Cycle Assessment; Vegetarian;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338.927","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Comparing the environmental impacts of meatless and meat-containing meals in the United States; Diet; Life Cycle Assessment; Vegetarian;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; This study compares the environmental impacts of meatless and meat-containing meals in the United States according to consumption data in order to identify commercial opportunities to lower environmental impacts of meals.

Since successful TR is the result of a complex interplay of several stochastic events such as gap formation, seed production, ungulate pressure and diseases, some of the processes have been neglected or strongly reduced for model applications. Most empirical data on TR originate from (national) forest inventories based on statistically optimized designs for timber resource estimations and use geographically fixed permanent plots. Consequently, these representative samples record TR both in gaps as well as under closed canopy conditions. In this study, we compared TR in  representative plots of the Swiss National Forest Inventory (‘NFI sampling’), located in beech and silver fir-beech forests along an elevation gradient in the Jura Mts., with an opportunistic ‘gap sampling’ strategy targeting TR-clusters. We analyzed quantitative (e.g., number of individuals) and qualitative (e.g., species diversity, similarity to surrounding canopy) differences between the ‘NFI sampling’ and ‘gap sampling,’ as well as the environmental factors (e.g., gap size, cluster age, elevation) influencing the composition of TR in small canopy gaps. The ‘gap sampling’ recorded higher median TR densities (+%, stems ha􀀀 ) and species richness (. ± ., mean ± sd) than the ‘NFI sampling’. More importantly, the ‘gap sampling’ provided much more consistent results among sites (i.e., x lower variance). Consequently, the ‘gap sampling’ revealed not only general but also species-specific patterns across TR size classes and along elevational gradients in contrast to the lack of patterns in the ‘NFI sampling’. Species richness decreased as TR grew taller, and the tallest TR size class (> cm) was almost solely comprised of the dominant species in the surrounding canopy (direct ingrowth). The high amount of direct ingrowth in TR indicates that small canopy gaps might offer only limited management potential to alter forests and that extensive disturbances or management at early TR stages (sapling) would be necessary to promote species better suited to the expected future site conditions. We raise the question of whether a forest monitoring that is statistically optimized for timber resource estimation is best suited to detect adaptation effects to quickly changing environments best visible at the regeneration stage, or whether forest inventory tools should be extended by methods that focus on disturbed parts of forests where changes and adaptations take place. We propose the implementation of an opportunistic gap-based monitoring of TR that essentially serves to identify the best forest management strategies (e.g. gap size, intervention intervals) in forests adapting to environmental change.","doc_id":14127,"prior":"species diversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"3","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4340","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Pädagogische Zuständigkeiten von Fachpersonen an Tagesschulen und die Bedeutung der Kooperation","authors":"Chiapparini, Emanuela; Kadrie, Selmani; Schuler, Patricia; Kappler, Christa","subject":"Soziale Arbeit; Schule; Tagesschule; Multiprofessionelle Kooperation;  Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe;  Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"361, 371","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Pädagogische Zuständigkeiten von Fachpersonen an Tagesschulen und die Bedeutung der Kooperation; Soziale Arbeit; Schule; Tagesschule; Multiprofessionelle Kooperation;  Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe;  Schulen und schulische Tätigkeiten; Tagesschulen und tagesstrukturelle Angebote an Schulen gewinnen als institutionalisierte Formen von öffentlicher Bildung und Erziehung immer mehr an Bedeutung in der Schweiz.

Damit wird eine Schulform bezeichnet, in der die Schülerinnen und Schüler an mindestens drei Tagen verbindlich ausserunterrichtliche Angebote (wie Mittagstisch und Nachmittagsangebote) nutzen. Dies ermöglicht eine Verzahnung von unterrichtlichen und ausserunterrichtlichen Angeboten und so werden multiprofessionelle Kooperationen (Fischer et al., ) konzeptionell verankert. Insbesondere an Tagesschulen soll der öffentliche Erziehungs- und Bildungsauftrag gemeinsam von Fachpersonen der Schule und Betreuung sowie der Sozialen Arbeit übernommen werden.Zudem gelten multiprofessionelle Kooperationen als Erfolgskriterium für die Einführung von Tagesschulen. Gleichzeitig sind Kooperationen von Fachpersonen der Schule und Betreuung sowie der Sozialen Arbeit – mit einzelnen Ausnahmen (Olk, T./Speck, K./Stimpel, T. ; Schüpbach/Jutzi/Thomann ) – in Deutschland und der Schweiz ungenügend untersucht.Hier knüpft das vom Schweizerischen Nationalfonds geförderte Projekt AusTEr (Chiapparini et al. ) an und erörtert mit einem professionstheoretischen Blick Aushandlungsprozesse der pädagogischen Zuständigkeiten an Tagesschulen im Spannungsfeld öffentlicher Erziehung.

A sustainable alternative for the production of bioactive plant compounds are plant biofactories based on cell cultures and organs. In addition, plant extracts from biofactories have significant advantages over those obtained from plants, since they are free of contamination by microorganisms, herbicides and pesticides, and they provide more stable levels of active ingredients. In this context, we report the establishment of Satureja khuzistanica cell cultures able to produce high amounts of rosmarinic acid (RA). The production of this phytopharmaceutical was increased when the cultures were elicited with coronatine and scaled up to a benchtop bioreactor. S. khuzistanica extracts enriched in RA were found to reduce the viability of cancer cell lines, increasing the sub-G/G cell population and the activity of caspase- in MCF- cells, which suggest that S. khuzistanica extracts can induce apoptosis of MCF- cells through activation of the extrinsic pathway.

La importancia de transacciones sin contraprestación, el rol del presupuesto como uno de los infor- mes financieros más relevantes y la estadística de finanzas públicas (EFP), constituyen características inmanentes al sector público que exigen normas específicas para contabilizar las transacciones típicas. El reporte COM() de la Comisión Europea analizó la posibilidad de aplicar las NICSP a los países miembros y concluye, que las NICSP deben ser la «referencia indiscutible», aunque la implementación con el método directo no sea posible, y propone la implementación indirecta, mediante normas europeas (NECSP), o en Inglés las EPSAS. No quedan dudas que la proposición exige un sistema integrado que requiere la integración del sistema pre- supuestario, la contabilidad, la auditoria y las estadísticas de finan- zas públicas (EFP). La definición de objetivos fiscales comunes exi- ge una definición conjunta de esos objetivos. También es evidente que las características del sector público exigen una contabilidad con base en el devengo, siguiendo normas que responden a esas características.

All publications concern Capercaillie studies conducted in Switzerland during the last decade. We concentrate on the results that are particularly important for the conservation of the species and influence conceptual decisions of a Capercaillie action plan. Based on our results, we recommend to plan conservation at the large scale and to consider (i) the ecological potential of a landscape as Capercaillie habitat, (ii) the recent distribution of local populations, (iii) the forest stand mosaic of each habitat patch, and (iv) the limiting factors of each regional population for the development and implementation of a national action plan. Conservation measures should aim to increase the carrying capacity of suitable habitat, support a population network and the exchange of individuals among populations, and reduce the impact of human disturbance. Thus, conceptual decisions need to be taken at the large, national scale whereas concrete measures should consider regional peculiarities.","doc_id":15048,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"34","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15289","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Methodical and design concept for the development of natural green roofs with a Narrative Environment : applied to the case studies Meret Oppenheim High-rise in Basel and a Residential Building in San Francisco","authors":"Dierckx, Lieve","subject":"Basel; Biodiversity; CoNaNalysis; Green roof; Green roof design; Habitat creation; Narrative environments; San Francisco;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Architektur","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333, 720","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Methodical and design concept for the development of natural green roofs with a Narrative Environment : applied to the case studies Meret Oppenheim High-rise in Basel and a Residential Building in San Francisco; Basel; Biodiversity; CoNaNalysis; Green roof; Green roof design; Habitat creation; Narrative environments; San Francisco;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Architektur; Natural green roofs are a proven instrument in urban ecology. They can bring biodiversity into urban areas and commit to sustainable architecture. As a standard, many research methodologies on creating biodiverse green roof concepts emphasize the site-analysis of the structural and ecological functional aspects. The esthetical and socio-cultural context is often left aside. This, however, can lead to little acceptance by the visitors because the ‘natural look’ of a green roof does not aesthetically appeal at all times. Therefore, the green roof gardens cannot be fully enjoyed and understood within all of their functions. The following questions arise: How can the acceptance of nature be awakened and how can nature on the roof be installed so that people can connect to it? How can function and aesthetics be merged and put into green roof concepts and planning?; Naturnahe Gründächer sind ein bewährtes Instrument in der Stadtökologie, da sie zu einer erhöhten Biodiversität in städtischen Gebieten beitragen können und der nachhaltigen Architektur gerecht werden. Zur Entwicklung von artenreichen Gründachkonzepten wird häufig eine Standortanalyse bezüglich der strukturellen und ökologischen Aspekte durchgeführt. Der ästhetische und soziokulturelle Kontext wird dabei oft vernachlässigt. Dies kann jedoch eine geringe Akzeptanz bei den Besuchern zur Folge haben, da das \"natürliche Aussehen\" eines Gründachs mit extensiver Bepflanzung ästhetisch nicht immer ansprechend ist. Da nicht all ihre Funktionen verstanden werden, können diese Dachgärten nicht in vollem Umfang genossen werden. Daraus ergeben sich folgende Fragen: Wie kann die Akzeptanz der Natur gefördert werden und wie muss die Natur auf Gründächern realisiert werden, dass sich Menschen darin wohlfühlen?

Second, on a concrete level, we consider the arrangement, the design and experience in all-day schools gained so far.Based on four research papers from Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and USA with qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches, the two aspects mentioned above are addressed and discussed.

The positive biodiversity‐stability relationship emerges via increased resistance and/or recovery to these events. However, invader presence might disrupt this diversity‐stability relationship by altering biotic interactions. Investigating such disruptions is important given that invasion by non‐native species and extreme climatic events are expected to increase in the future due to anthropogenic pressure.Here, we present one of the first multisite invader x biodiversity x drought manipulation experiment to examine combined effects of biodiversity and invasion on drought resistance and recovery at three semi‐natural grassland sites across Europe. The stability of biomass production to an extreme drought manipulation (% rainfall reduction; BE:  days, BG:  days, DE:  days) was quantified in field mesocosms with a richness gradient of , , and  species and three invasion treatments (no invader, Lupinus polyphyllus, Senecio inaequidens).Our results suggest that biodiversity stabilized community productivity by increasing the ability of native species to recover from extreme drought events. However, invader presence turned the positive and stabilizing effects of diversity on native species recovery into a neutral relationship. This effect was independent of the two invader's own capacity to recover from an extreme drought event.In summary, we found that invader presence may disrupt how native community interactions lead to stability of ecosystems in response to extreme climatic events. Consequently, the interaction of three global change drivers, climate extremes, diversity decline, and invasive species, may exacerbate their effects on ecosystem functioning.","doc_id":15394,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20334","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Biotic stability mechanisms in Inner Mongolian grassland","authors":"Wang, Yonghui; Niu, Xiaxia; Zhao, Liqing; Liang, Cunzhu; Miao, Bailing; Zhang, Qing; Zhang, Jing Hui; Schmid, Bernhard; Ma, Wenhong","subject":"Biodiversity; Dominant specie; Portfolio effect; Precipitation variability; Productivity; Species synchrony;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Biotic stability mechanisms in Inner Mongolian grassland; Biodiversity; Dominant specie; Portfolio effect; Precipitation variability; Productivity; Species synchrony;  Ökologie; Electronic supplementary material is available online at https://doi.org/./m.figshare.c..; Biotic mechanisms associated with species diversity are expected to stabilize communities in theoretical and experimental studies but may be difficult to detect in natural communities exposed to large environmental variation.

Here, we explore the potential of repeated habitat mapping data to identify floristic changes over time. Using one German federal state as a case study, we assessed floristic changes between the s and s. These habitat data have great potential for analysis because of their high spatial coverage while also posing methodological challenges such as incomplete observation data. We developed a modelling approach that accounts for incomplete observations and explored the ability to detect temporal trends.Location: The Federal State of Schleswig‐Holstein (Germany)Methods: We compiled plant species lists from the earliest (s) and most recent (s) habitat mapping survey and aligned differing habitat definitions across mapping campaigns. A total of , mapped polygons, each with a list of species records, intersected the two surveys. We accounted for underrecorded species by assigning occurrence probabilities, based on species co‐occurrence information across all surveys, using Beals' index and tested the robustness of this approach by simulation experiments. For those species with significant increases and decreases in occurrence probability, we linked these trends to the species' functional characteristics.Results: We found a systematic loss of species that are moderately threatened. Species that indicate low nitrogen supply and high soil moisture declined, suggesting a shift towards a more eutrophic and drier landscape. Importantly, assessing specific plant traits associated with losses, we also detected a decrease in species with reddish and blueish flowers and species providing nectar, pointing to a decrease of insect‐pollinated taxa.Main conclusions: The identified changes raise concerns that plant biodiversity has fundamentally changed over the last three decades, with concomitant consequences for ecosystem services, especially pollination. Given the general lack of historical standardized data, our approach for trend analyses using incomplete observation data may be widely applicable to assess long‐term biodiversity change.","doc_id":15614,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3742","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Invitation and guide to the 11th EDGG Field Workshop Grasslands of inneralpine dry valleys : part 1, Eastern Alps, Austria, 6-13 July 2018","authors":"Magnes, Martin; Mayrhofer, Helmut; Kirschner, Philipp; Stöhr, Philipp; Schwager, Patrick; Dengler, Jürgen; Biurrun, Idoia","subject":"Dry grassland;  Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"577","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Invitation and guide to the th EDGG Field Workshop Grasslands of inneralpine dry valleys : part , Eastern Alps, Austria, - July ; Dry grassland;  Ökologie; Following an initial study of vascular plant diversity in the area of the Aosta valley (Wiesner et al. ), one of the driest regions of the inneralpine valleys, the authors came up with the idea to start a systematic investigation of the grassland vegetation of the inneralpine dry valleys as a whole.

La mise en récit et la narration d’un processus de conception à la fois conservateur, innovant, entrepreneurial, stratégique, collaboratif et fondé sur la connaissance génèrent des narrations entrepreneuriales, des conceptions, des réseaux et des discours spécifiques à l’organisation. Cette interaction est proposée comme le socle de l’histoire entrepreneuriale et de la création de valeurs qui façonnent l’identité narrative des projets, des organisations et des entreprises. Dans les deux études de cas présentées ici, ceci se traduit par un récit relatif aux «curatorial ‘tooligans’ and busy brokers» et aux héros-entrepreneurs en tant qu’«aventuriers victorieux et gardiens de la conservation». Pour terminer, nous présentons quelques futures pistes de recherche dans le domaine émergeant de la narration entrepreneuriale.

By focusing on two case studies from the Swiss cultural and creative industries sector, narrative praxes, practices and practitioners of entrepreneurial storytelling in project- and organizational development are outlined. Story-making and story-telling about a curatorial, innovative, entrepreneurial, strategic, collaborative and knowledge-driven design process generate entrepreneurial narration, design, networks and organization-specific discourse. This interplay is suggested as the basis for the entrepreneurial story and value creation that shape the narrative identity of projects, organizations and enterprises. In the case studies presented this is constituted through the project-narrative of “curating tooligans and busy brokers” and the entrepreneurial hero-narrative of “conquering adventurers and preserving guardians”. Implications are discussed to guide future comparable research for the emerging field of entrepreneurial storytelling. In view of the development and transfer of new tools and formats for teaching, coaching and consulting, first applications for professionals are argued.","doc_id":15780,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"2","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15285","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Waldfriedhof Schaffhausen als Lebensraum für Wildtiere : Bestandesaufnahme ausgewählter Artengruppen (Wirbeltiere und Wirbellose)","authors":"Guhl, Etienne","subject":" Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"590","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Waldfriedhof Schaffhausen als Lebensraum für Wildtiere : Bestandesaufnahme ausgewählter Artengruppen (Wirbeltiere und Wirbellose);  Tiere (Zoologie); The wooden cemetery in Schaffhausen has a broad spectrum of different habitats.

Fatigue is the most frequent symptom reported in literature. Occupational therapists (OTs) are specialized in client-centered problem analysis, counseling, and education to recover occupational engagement and performance in everyday life. Since the beginning of the COVID- pandemic, OTs have been challenged to respond with services adequate to the needs of this patient group. Energy management education (EME) was initially developed for persons with multiple sclerosis-related fatigue and then made independent of diagnosis suitable to persons living with chronic disease-related fatigue. EME, a structured self-management education, is becoming a part of the new services. This study was aimed at exploring the initial experiences of OTs using the EME protocol and materials with persons with postacute COVID- and/or post-COVID- condition-related fatigue and gathering their recommendations for improvements and adaptions. One online focus group discussion took place in May  with OTs experienced in using the EME protocol. The topics addressed were the institutional context of the OTs and their experiences during the treatment. A thematic analysis was performed. According to nine OTs working in different settings in Switzerland, the EME protocol is exploitable in both in- and outpatient settings and was judged appropriate by them, even if the EME materials can be improved. The main challenges for the OTs were the short period their patients had lived with fatigue; the discrepancy between self-concept, self-perception, and performance; and the insecurity, fear, and anxiety related to recovery. Further research is needed to include the perspective of EME participants and to measure quantitative outcomes such as fatigue impact, self-efficacy, occupational performance, and quality of life. Until the existing EME protocol is improved, it is applicable to persons with post-COVID- condition-related fatigue.","doc_id":15837,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18502","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"«Das Zünglein an der Waage» :  welche Kompetenzen benötigen Pflegefachpersonen, um einen Suizidversuch unmittelbar zu unterbrechen?","authors":"Müller, Mirco","subject":"Suicide; Attempted suicide; Crisis intervention; Mental health care; Competence;  Pflege;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"610.73, 616.8","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"«Das Zünglein an der Waage» :  welche Kompetenzen benötigen Pflegefachpersonen, um einen Suizidversuch unmittelbar zu unterbrechen?; Suicide; Attempted suicide; Crisis intervention; Mental health care; Competence;  Pflege;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Jährlich sterben weltweit rund ’ Personen durch Suizid.

The results allow further conclusions about important habitat structures for a species-rich snail fauna on roofs as well as on the occurrence of populations of Candidula unifasci¬nata, Xerolenta obvia and Helicella itala, which are valuable for nature conservation in urban areas.","doc_id":15988,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14913","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Comparing the sensitivity of different fish species to optimize the assessment of mycotoxin toxicity","authors":"Tschirren, Linda; Pietsch-Schmied, Constanze","subject":" Physiologie und verwandte Themen","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"571","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Comparing the sensitivity of different fish species to optimize the assessment of mycotoxin toxicity;  Physiologie und verwandte Themen","doc_id":16027,"prior":"fish species","sdg14":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20529","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Directional trends in species composition over time can lead to a widespread overemphasis of year‐to‐year asynchrony","authors":"Valencia, Enrique; de Bello, Francesco; Lepš, Jan; Galland, Thomas; E‐Vojtkó, Anna; Conti, Luisa; Danihelka, Jiří; Dengler, Jürgen; Eldridge, David J.; Estiarte, Marc; García‐González, Ricardo; Garnier, Eric; Gómez, Daniel; Harrison, Susan; Herben, Tomas; Ibáñez, Ricardo; Jentsch, Anke; Juergens, Norbert; Kertész, Miklós; Klumpp, Katja; Louault, Frédérique; Marrs, Rob H.; Ónodi, Gábor; Pakeman, Robin J.; Pärtel, Meelis; Peco, Begoña; Peñuelas, Josep; Rueda, Marta; Schmidt, Wolfgang; Schmiedel, Ute; Schuetz, Martin; Skalova, Hana; Šmilauer, Petr; Šmilauerová, Marie; Smit, Christian; Song, Ming‐Hua; Stock, Martin; Val, James; Vandvik, Vigdis; Wesche, Karsten; Woodcock, Ben A.; Young, Truman P.; Yu, Fei‐Hai; Zobel, Martin; Götzenberger, Lars","subject":"Asynchrony; Biodiversity; Stability; Synchrony; Temporal dynamics; Year‐to‐year fluctuation;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Directional trends in species composition over time can lead to a widespread overemphasis of year‐to‐year asynchrony; Asynchrony; Biodiversity; Stability; Synchrony; Temporal dynamics; Year‐to‐year fluctuation;  Ökologie; Questions: Compensatory dynamics are described as one of the main mechanisms that increase community stability, e.g., where decreases of some species on a year-to-year basis are offset by an increase in others. Deviations from perfect synchrony between species (asynchrony) have therefore been advocated as an important mechanism underlying biodiversity effects on stability. However, it is unclear to what extent existing measures of synchrony actually capture the signal of year-to-year species fluctuations in the presence of long-term directional trends in both species abundance and composition (species directional trends hereafter). Such directional trends may lead to a misinterpretation of indices commonly used to reflect year-to-year synchrony.Methods: An approach based on three-term local quadrat variance (T) which assesses population variability in a three-year moving window, was used to overcome species directional trend effects. This “detrending” approach was applied to common indices of synchrony across a worldwide collection of  temporal plant community datasets comprising almost , individual plots sampled for at least six years. Plots included were either maintained under constant “control” conditions over time or were subjected to different management or disturbance treatments.Results: Accounting for directional trends increased the detection of year-to-year synchronous patterns in all synchrony indices considered. Specifically, synchrony values increased significantly in ~% of the datasets with the T detrending approach while in ~% synchrony decreased. For the  studies with both control and manipulated conditions, the increase in synchrony values was stronger for longer time series, particularly following experimental manipulation.Conclusions: Species’ long-term directional trends can affect synchrony and stability measures potentially masking the ecological mechanism causing year-to-year fluctuations. As such, previous studies on community stability might have overemphasised the role of compensatory dynamics in real-world ecosystems, and particularly in manipulative conditions, when not considering the possible overriding effects of long-term directional trends.","doc_id":16035,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22093","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Strategic points in aquaponics","authors":"Junge, Ranka; König, Bettina; Villarroel, Morris; Komives, Tamas; Jijakli, M.","subject":"Aquaponics; Challenges; Bacteria; Sustainability;  Aquakultur","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"639.8","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Strategic points in aquaponics; Aquaponics; Challenges; Bacteria; Sustainability;  Aquakultur; Global environmental, social and economic challenges drive the need for new and improved solutions for food production and consumption.

Zur Zeit beschränkt sich die Bereinigung der Daten auf eine Sichtung der Messwertverläufe und des Stationsjournals sowie der Interpretation von einzelnen Messsystemmeldungen in Form von sogenannten Status-Codes. Dies bedeutet, dass spezialisierte Personen mit höchster Konzentration u.a. die Messwertverläufe am Bildschirm visualisieren müssen, um bei Auffälligkeiten die entsprechenden Zeitabschnitte genauer zu untersuchen. Oft handelt es sich bei den der Fachperson «ins Auge gefallenen» Werten um besondere lufthygienische Ereignisse, welche nicht auf einen Defekt im Mess- oder Datenübertragungssystem zurückgeführt werden können. Die Daten bleiben in diesem Fall konsequenterweise unverändert in der Datenbank. Wenn die auffälligen Werte mit grösster Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine Fehlfunktion des Systems zurückzuführen sind, werden die entsprechenden Daten in der Datenbank als ungültig markiert und von weiteren Berechnungen und Publikationen ausgeschlossen. Dieses Vorgehen ist mit zwei Unzulänglichkeiten behaftet: Zum einen durchlaufen die Daten, welche aus Aktualitätsgründen automatisch, z.B. via Internet, publiziert werden, erst nachträglich eine Plausibilisierung. Zum andern ist die visuelle Überprüfung aller Daten aufwendig und für die durchführende Person sehr ermüdend. In dieser Arbeit wurden Vorschläge zum automatischen Auffinden von auffälligen Ozon-, Stickoxid- und PM-Werten erarbeitet, welche einfach in eta zu implementieren sind. Auffällig werden in diesem Zusammenhang Werte bezeichnet, deren Eigenschaften stark von den erwarteten abweichen und somit potentiell fehlerbehaftet sind. Die Implementation dieses Verfahrens erlaubt der Fachperson, sich bei der Plausibilisierung der Luftmessdaten in Zukunft vor allem auf diese auffälligen Stellen zu konzentrieren. Damit kann sie gleichzeitig ihre Effizienz steigern und die Gefahr verringern, dass fehlerbehaftete Stellen in den Daten übersehen werden. Das vorgeschlagene Verfahren wurde an Datensätzen von vier in ihrer lokalen Situation sehr unterschiedlichen Standorten überprüft:Lungern-Schönbühl (nur O-Messungen, Hintergrundstandort auf  m ü. Meer), Schwyz (Regionalzentrum), Luzern (Stadtstandort ohne direkte Verkehrsbeeinflussung), Erstfeld (Standort unmittelbar neben der Gotthard-Autobahn). Die verwendeten Datensätze waren vorgängig durch in-Luft mit dem üblichen Verfahren manuell bereinigt worden und sollten somit keine Daten von schlechter Qualität mehr enthalten. Die Parameter der hier vorgestellten Verfahren wurden so eingestellt, dass unabhängig vom Standorttyp pro Schadstoff und Jahr im bereinigten Datensatz  bis  Stellen als auffällig markiert werden. Die auffälligen Stellen waren dabei relativ gleichmässig über das Jahr verteilt. Je nach Schadstoff wurden zwei (NO, NO, O) bzw. drei (NOx, Ox, PM) Regeln aufgestellt, welche von unauffälligen Werten gleichzeitig eingehalten werden müssen. Mit Ausnahme des zulässigen Wertebereichs konnten alle Regeln standortunabhängig gestaltet werden. Auf Grund der absichtlich sehr eng gesetzten zulässigen Wertebereiche könnten in Jahren mit aussergewöhnlichen Wetterbedingungen (extrem sonnenreicher und heisser Sommer oder ein Winter mit lang anhaltenden Inversionen) zu gewissen Zeiten gehäuft auffällige Werte auftreten, welche damit auf die aussergewöhnliche Situation des entsprechenden Jahres hinweisen würden. Als Nebenprodukt der Entwicklung dieser Plausibilisierungsverfahren wurden auch interessante lufthygienische Erkenntnisse gewonnen. Es zeigte sich z. B., dass die Ox-Werte zeitlich und örtlich viel glatter sind als die entsprechenden O-Werte. Das Verhalten für die PM-Werte liegt zwischen demjenigen von Ox und O. Grössere Ox-Konzentrationssprünge in Tälern des Alpengebiets können auf Föhnereignisse hinweisen: In der Hälfte der Ox-Sprünge ( von ) war dies z.B. in Erstfeld der Fall. Bei steigenden Temperaturen nahm die Luftfeuchtigkeit sprunghaft ab und gleichzeitig die Windgeschwindigkeit deutlich zu. In vier weiteren Fällen konnten die aussergewöhnlich hohen Sprünge ebenfalls mit zunehmendem Wind (ohne Änderung der Temperatur und Luftfeuchte) erklärt werden.","doc_id":16204,"prior":"Meer","sdg14":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23924","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Regional typology of spring vegetation in Parc Ela (Grisons, Switzerland)","authors":"Seiler, Hallie; Küry, Daniel; Billeter, Regula; Dengler, Jürgen","subject":"Bryophyte; Helocrene; Montane; Montio-Cardaminetea; Parc Ela; Phytosociology; Regional typology; Rheocrene; Spring vegetation; Subalpine; Switzerland; Unsupervised classification;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"580","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Regional typology of spring vegetation in Parc Ela (Grisons, Switzerland); Bryophyte; Helocrene; Montane; Montio-Cardaminetea; Parc Ela; Phytosociology; Regional typology; Rheocrene; Spring vegetation; Subalpine; Switzerland; Unsupervised classification;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Aims: The spring habitats of Central Europe are insular biotopes of high ecological value. Although subject to severe exploitation pressures, they do not yet have a comprehensive protection status in Switzerland. Contributing to this challenge is the controversy involved with their syntaxonomic classification. In the context of the development of a regional conservation strategy and the establishment of a national inventory of Swiss springs, we carried out a regional survey of spring vegetation and aimed to translate this into a classification system. Study area: Montane and subalpine zones of Parc Ela (Grisons, Switzerland). Methods: We selected  springs to cover different regions, elevations and bedrock types within the park. In each of them we recorded complete vascular plant and bryophyte composition as well as a range of environmental variables in three -m² plots that were placed to reflect the heterogeneity within the spring. After running an unsupervised classification with modified TWINSPAN, the distinguished vegetation units were characterized in terms of diagnostic species, species richness and environmental variables and placed within the syntaxonomic system. Results: Species richness was high (total species , mean . species in  m). The two most important environmental gradients of the ordination were elevation/water conductivity and insolation/water pH/soil reaction EIV. We distinguished seven communities within two main groups. Conclusions: All unshaded springs, including those over siliceous bedrock, could be assigned to a broadly defined Cratoneurion. The petrifying springs were not strongly distinguishable floristically from other base-rich springs. The forest springs, although often not clearly differentiated from their unshaded counterparts, could be provisionally divided into the alliances Caricion remotae and Lycopodo europaei-Cratoneurion commutati. As there is a certain threat to these habitats in the park due to anthropogenic influence, protection measures are recommended, most importantly the appropriate management of alpine pastures.","doc_id":16250,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19650","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Development of a method for reliable power input measurements in conventional and single-use stirred bioreactors at laboratory scale","authors":"Kaiser, Stephan C.; Werner, Sören; Jossen, Valentin; Kraume, Matthias; Eibl, Dieter","subject":"Measurement; Power input; Single‐use bioreactor; Stirrer; Torque;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Development of a method for reliable power input measurements in conventional and single-use stirred bioreactors at laboratory scale; Measurement; Power input; Single‐use bioreactor; Stirrer; Torque;  Technische Chemie; Power input is an important engineering and scale-up/down criterion in stirred bioreactors. However, reliably measuring power input in laboratory-scale systems is still challenging. Even though torque measurements have proven to be suitable in pilot scale systems, sensor accuracy, resolution, and errors from relatively high levels of friction inside bearings can become limiting factors at smaller scales. An experimental setup for power input measurements was developed in this study by focusing on stainless steel and single-use bioreactors in the single-digit volume range. The friction losses inside the air bearings were effectively reduced to less than .% of the measurement range of the torque meter. A comparison of dimensionless power numbers determined for a reference Rushton turbine stirrer (NP = . ± . for fully turbulent conditions) revealed good agreement with literature data. Hence, the power numbers of several reusable and single-use bioreactors could be determined over a wide range of Reynolds numbers between  and >. Power numbers of between . and . (for Re = ) were determined for the different systems. The rigid plastic vessels showed similar power characteristics to their reusable counterparts.

First proposed in  [], it has recently received new attention and has been undergoing development, in which numerical simulations play an important role. To date, a few papers devoted to modeling and simulation of this particular new-generation flow battery chemistry were published. In the present work, a one-dimensional (D), steady-state, macrohomogeneous, mathematical model of a single-cell hydrogen-bromine flow battery (HBFB) is developed, described and solved. It comprises of the most relevant transport through-plane processes and electrochemical phenomena for the operation of the HBFB, namely: charge transport, water, gaseous hydrogen, proton, bromine and (tri)bromide mass transport. Furthermore, the model is enhanced with supplementary phenomena to better approximate the physics described in the simulation such as: bromine-tribromide ionic equilibria, Nernstian losses due to reactant local surface concentration variations, Donnan potential on the HBr/Br solution-membrane interface, and gas adsorption in the ionomer on the gaseous hydrogen side according to Henry’s law.The model description emphasizes the importance of electrochemical and flux sign conventions, and the meaning of appropriate boundary conditions, which was seldom the case in the published modeling approaches. A complete set of plots of each dependent variable and the associated fluxes are provided. A system of nonlinear second-order partial differential equations describing the problem is solved using COMSOL Multiphysics software with the General PDE Form module for a better control over the actual governing equations (conservation laws) as well as auxiliary algebraic field equations. The D approach allows for solving the problem within seconds on a laptop-class computer and permits running multiple case studies within short time. Moreover, a parametric study is performed (Fig. ) to examine the impact of selected parameters on the overall performance of a single cell. The validity of the model is verified based on results from a set of experiments carried out at Fraunhofer ICT (internal, multidisciplinary cooperation within the Flowcamp* project) using an isothermal single test cell.","doc_id":16480,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5355","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Local insects as flagship species to promote nature conservation? : a survey among primary school children on their attitudes toward invertebrates","authors":"Schlegel, Jürg; Breuer, Gabriele; Rupf, Reto","subject":" Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 590","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Local insects as flagship species to promote nature conservation? : a survey among primary school children on their attitudes toward invertebrates;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Tiere (Zoologie); Flagship species play an important role in promoting nature conservation.

We aimed to disentangle the separate impacts of these two for sets of vascular plant, bird, butterfly and dragonfly species listed as characteristic for European dry grasslands and wetlands, two habitats of high and threatened biodiversity. We combined articulations of the four frequently used SRES climate scenarios and associated land use change projections for , and assessed their impact on population trends in species (i.e. whether they would probably be declining, stable or increasing). We used the BIOSCORE database tool, which allows assessment of the effects of a range of environmental pressures including climate change as well as land use change. We updated the species lists included in this tool for our two habitat types. We projected species change for two spatial scales: the EU covering most of Europe, and the more restricted biogeographic region of 'Continental Europe'. Other environmental pressures modelled for the four scenarios than land use and climate change generally did not explain a significant part of the variance in species richness change. Changes in characteristic bird and dragonfly species were least pronounced. Land use change was the most important driver for vascular plants in both habitats and spatial scales, leading to a decline in -% of the species included, whereas climate change was more important for wetland dragonflies and birds (-%). Patterns of species decline were similar in continental Europe and the EU for wetlands but differed for dry grasslands, where a substantially lower proportion of butterflies and birds declined in continental Europe, and % of bird species increased, probably linked to a projected increase in semi-natural vegetation. In line with the literature using climate envelope models, we found little divergence among the four scenarios. Our findings suggest targeted policies depending on habitat and species group. These are, for dry grasslands, to reduce land use change or its effects and to enhance connectivity, and for wetlands to mitigate climate change effects.","doc_id":16582,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"50","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24585","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Resilient evaluators : characteristics, conditions and prospects","authors":"Pleger, Lyn E.; Leeuw, Frans L.","subject":" Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"155","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Resilient evaluators : characteristics, conditions and prospects;  Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie; A second look at ethical challenges related to independence is provided by Pleger and Leeuw in this chapter. They focus on resilience as an ethical characteristic that evaluators need to have in order to be independent in a useful way. They see issues of resilience especially in light of what they call the evaluator’s dilemma to navigate between the demands of evaluation clients and the needs of a valid and credible scientific perspective in the evaluation. A survey among experienced evaluators on how they perceive resilience leads the authors to present a model of evaluator resistance that is further discussed to formulate recommendations on how resilience can be improved. They refer to the various components of independence: methodological and ethical competence of the evaluator, and organizational aspects (protocols). The new perspective proposed – that runs contrary to the more static idea of “conflict of interests” – is that “the influencing attempts from individuals involved in the evaluation” may be destructive but also constructive, according to Pleger and Leeuw. Hence, this requires thinking about the evaluator’s independence not as deafness to external negative influence, but as an ability to distinguish between destructive [undermining and distortion] and constructive [betterment and support] influence. “When independence is understood as the resistance to any external influence, then the independent evaluator would need to ignore the client’s request”, even if it would correct errors, or lead to a better-quality evaluation. Instead, what is needed is an autonomous judgment of the evaluators, which can be attained in an iterative process where they will develop “coping strategies for handling difficult situations within the evaluation process”. This movement between exposition to influence, autonomous judgment, then return to independence, is, according to Pleger and Leeuw, better captured by the concept of resilience: while the independence concept primarily outlines a situation or circumstance, resilience focuses on actions and actors.","doc_id":16611,"prior":"destructive","sdg14":1},{"id":"53","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12187","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Macromolecular crowding amplifies adipogenesis of human bone marrow-derived MSCs by enhancing the pro-adipogenic microenvironment","authors":"Ang, Xiu Min; Lee, Michelle H.C.; Blocki, Anna; Chen, Clarice; Ong, L.L.

Contrary to conventional in-vitro culture practices, the in-vivo stem cell microenvironment is physiologically crowded. We demonstrate here that re-introducing macromolecular crowding (MMC) at biologically relevant fractional volume occupancy during chemically induced adipogenesis substantially enhances the adipogenic differentiation response of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Both early and late adipogenic markers were significantly up-regulated and cells accumulated -% more lipid content under MMC relative to standard induction cocktails. MMC significantly enhanced deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), notably collagen IV and perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. As a novel observation, MMC also increased the presence of matrix metalloproteinase- in the deposited ECM, which was concomitant with geometrical ECM remodeling typical of adipogenesis. This suggested a microenvironment that was richer in both matrix components and associated ligands and was conducive to adipocyte maturation. This assumption was confirmed by seeding undifferentiated MSCs on decellularized ECM deposited by adipogenically differentiated MSCs, Adipo-ECM. On Adipo-ECM generated under crowding, MSCs differentiated much faster under a classical differentiation protocol. This was evidenced throughout the induction time course, by a significant up-regulation of both early and late adipogenic markers and a % higher lipid content on MMC-generated Adipo-ECM in comparison to standard induction on tissue culture plastic. This suggests that MMC helps build and endow the nascent microenvironment with adipogenic cues. Therefore, MMC initiates a positive feedback loop between cells and their microenvironment as soon as progenitor cells are empowered to build and shape it, and, in turn, are informed by it to respond by attaining a stable differentiated phenotype if so induced. This work sheds new light on the utility of MMC to tune the microenvironment to augment the generation of adipose tissue from differentiating human MSCs.","doc_id":16798,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19276","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Wildbienen in einem Stadtzürcher Familiengartenareal : Bestandesaufnahme, Beurteilung und Förderung","authors":"Heller, Philipp","subject":"Wildbienen; Schrebergärten; Stadtgärten; Artenvielfalt; Stadtökologie; Wildbienenschutz; urbane Biodiversität;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"590","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Wildbienen in einem Stadtzürcher Familiengartenareal : Bestandesaufnahme, Beurteilung und Förderung; Wildbienen; Schrebergärten; Stadtgärten; Artenvielfalt; Stadtökologie; Wildbienenschutz; urbane Biodiversität;  Tiere (Zoologie); Die Wildbienenvorkommen der Stadt Zürich waren in den letzten drei Jahrzehnten Gegenstand mehrerer Untersuchungen.

The ground level distribution of the emitted gas has been obtained and the influence of the wind speed and direction, vessel chimney height, ambient temperature and exhaust gas temperature have been studied. The deposition range is found to be the largest when the wind speed is low. At high wind speeds, the deposition of pollutants along the wind direction is enhanced and spots of high pollutant concentration can be created.

Kuhn) has become increasingly invasive in abandoned or undergrazed Alpine grasslands. Bracken stands are generally assumed to be poor in species, but there is still very little information about the impact on the fauna. We recorded Orthoptera communities of  sample plots with varying bracken cover. Compared to plots with only sparse or medium bracken cover, species richness was highly significantly lower in densely overgrown plots, while the former two did not differ markedly. Multivariate ordination analyses revealed gradients with unequal orthopteran communities, showing distinct patterns of bracken cover clustering. Based on indicator values,  of  Orthoptera species turned out to be significantly or marginally significantly associated with a single bracken cover stratum or a combination of two strata, whereby all nine Red List species were primarily restricted to sparse or medium bracken cover. However, some generalist species were found to favor denser bracken stands, such as Tettigonia viridissima, contributing to the local Orthoptera beta diversity. Our data suggest that ongoing rotational sheep grazing with temporary paddocks is regarded as the most preferable management system. However, selected parts of the study area, which have only sparse vegetation and no pressure of bracken or scrub overgrowth, are recommended to be alternately left ungrazed for a few years to allow for the coexistence of different successional stages. Low-intensity bracken control measures, situationally by mowing or uprooting, are considered appropriate and should be pursued.Implications for insect conservation: Even though most specialized and rare Orthoptera species in Western Europe tend to prefer sparsely vegetated areas, subareas with medium to even dense vegetation cover might promote certain generalist species, leading to a higher local species richness.","doc_id":16933,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20227","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Vielfalt der Totholzkäferfauna im Waldföhrenwald Crap Ses, Surses (Graubünden)","authors":"Huber, Barbara; Büche, Boris; Szallies, Alexander; Bühler, Ueli","subject":"Coleoptera; Totholzkäfer; Neufunde; Urwaldrelikt-Arten; Waldföhre;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"333.7, 590","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Vielfalt der Totholzkäferfauna im Waldföhrenwald Crap Ses, Surses (Graubünden); Coleoptera; Totholzkäfer; Neufunde; Urwaldrelikt-Arten; Waldföhre;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Tiere (Zoologie); Im Waldföhrenwald Crap Ses in der Gemeinde Surses im Parc Ela wurde im Jahr  die Vielfalt xylobionter (Holz bewohnender) Käferarten untersucht.

However, studies rarely consider the compositional pitfalls of such analyses. This is problematic as it may lead to arbitrary results when non-compositional statistical analysis is applied to compositional datasets. In this study, compositional data analysis (CoDa), which is widely used in other research fields, is compared with classical statistical analysis to demonstrate how the results vary depending on the approach and to show the best possible statistical analysis. For example, honey and saffron are highly susceptible to adulteration and imitation, so the determination of their chemical elements requires the best possible statistical analysis. Our study demonstrated how principle component analysis (PCA) and classification results are influenced by the pre-processing steps conducted on the raw data, and the replacement strategies for missing values and non-detects. Furthermore, it demonstrated the differences in results when compositional and non-compositional methods were applied. Our results suggested that the outcome of the log-ratio analysis provided better separation between the pure and adulterated data and allowed for easier interpretability of the results and a higher accuracy of classification. Similarly, it showed that classification with artificial neural networks (ANNs) works poorly if the CoDa pre-processing steps are left out. From these results, we advise the application of CoDa methods for analyses of the chemical elements of food and for the characterization and authentication of food products.","doc_id":17091,"prior":"contamination","sdg14":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4490","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The acidity of surface groups of dioctahedral smectites","authors":"Kaufhold, S.; Stanjek, H.; Penner, Dirk; Dohrmann, R.","subject":" Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"540","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"The acidity of surface groups of dioctahedral smectites;  Chemie","doc_id":17095,"prior":"acidity","sdg14":1},{"id":"23","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22389","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"“Mission B” für mehr Biodiversität : Planung einer dreiteiligen Dachbegrünung auf den Dächern des SRF in Zürich Leutschenbach","authors":"Grossi, Marina","subject":"Biodiversitätsförderung; Chinaschilf; Extensive Dachbegrünung; Feldstein; Heimische Pflanzung; Mission B; Ökologische Experimente; Pflanzenkohle; Schafwolle; Standortangepasste Pflanzung; Staudenunterbepflanzung; Strukturelemente; Urbane Biodiversität; Versuchsdesign; Versuchslabor;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"635","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"“Mission B” für mehr Biodiversität : Planung einer dreiteiligen Dachbegrünung auf den Dächern des SRF in Zürich Leutschenbach; Biodiversitätsförderung; Chinaschilf; Extensive Dachbegrünung; Feldstein; Heimische Pflanzung; Mission B; Ökologische Experimente; Pflanzenkohle; Schafwolle; Standortangepasste Pflanzung; Staudenunterbepflanzung; Strukturelemente; Urbane Biodiversität; Versuchsdesign; Versuchslabor;  Gartenpflanzen (Gartenbau); In dieser Arbeit wird ein extensives Gründachlabor auf einem Studiodach des SRF Leutschenbach in Zürich geplant, das zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt umgesetzt werden soll.

Different types of hydroponic systems have been used for growing crops in aquaponics. However, very few studies have compared their suitability and efficiency in an aquaponic context. The study presented here compares tomato yield, morphological (external) and biochemical (internal) fruit quality, and overall tomato plant vitality from three different HP systems (nutrient film technique, drip irrigation system, and floating raft culture) and examines the distribution of nutrients in different parts of the tomato plant. Three replicate AP systems were set up, each incorporating the three different HP systems coupled with a separate recirculating aquaculture unit growing Nile tilapia. The results showed that the choice of the cultivation system had little influence on most of the above-mentioned properties. Tomato fruit mineral content was found to be in similar range for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn as reported in the literature. Yield and fruit quality were similar in all three systems. However, the drip irrigation system did perform slightly better. The slightly higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of the fruits grown in AP in comparison to commercially produced and supermarket derived tomatoes might indicate a potential for producing fruits with higher health value for humans.","doc_id":17172,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20075","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Co-cultivation of microalgae in aquaculture water : interactions, growth and nutrient removal efficiency at laboratory- and pilot-scale","authors":"Tejido-Nuñez, Yaiza; Aymerich, Enrique; Sancho, Luis; Refardt, Dominik","subject":"Aquaculture; Nutrients; Protozoa; Water treatment; Chlorella vulgaris; Tetradesmus obliquus;  Biologie;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570, 630","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Co-cultivation of microalgae in aquaculture water : interactions, growth and nutrient removal efficiency at laboratory- and pilot-scale; Aquaculture; Nutrients; Protozoa; Water treatment; Chlorella vulgaris; Tetradesmus obliquus;  Biologie;  Landwirtschaft; - Successful co-cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris and Tetradesmus obliquus- Stable cultivation despite presence of protozoa- Shifts in species frequency in co-culture likely caused by protozoa- Pilot-scale cultivation reached a final dry weight of . g l−- Maximum productivity at pilot-scale was . g m− d−; Microalgae biotechnology is of increasing importance and a central application concerns the treatment of wastewater. Here, its implementation in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) to lower the discharge of wastewater is studied. To better cope with external variations in culture conditions, a co-cultivation of two species of microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris and Tetradesmus obliquus, was used to obtain a more reliable and robust culture and was compared to monocultures. This approach was tested using RAS water both under sterile and non-sterile conditions at laboratory scale and then compared to a co-culture at pilot-scale in an open thin-layer photobioreactor. Performance of cultures was tested in terms of microalgae growth and nutrient removal efficiency. Furthermore, to better understand the interaction between environmental variables and each microalgae species, their relative frequencies in co-cultures as well as the presence of protozoa and bacteria were monitored. All growth experiments were carried out successfully and, unlike in a previous study, no crashes were observed. However, shifts in species frequency in co-cultures indicated that the two species were differentially affected by cultivation conditions. Despite nutrient limitation, the pilot-scale cultivation had a high productivity (. g m− d−) and final dry weight (. g l−) after  days and demonstrated its suitability for RAS water treatment.","doc_id":17562,"prior":"aquaculture","sdg14":1},{"id":"65","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22103","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Importance of nickel as a micronutrient in aquaponic systems : some theoretical considerations","authors":"Komives, Tamas; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Nickel;  Aquakultur","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"639.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Importance of nickel as a micronutrient in aquaponic systems : some theoretical considerations; Aquaponics; Nickel;  Aquakultur; This Note paper calls the attention to the important role the microelement nickel plays is the decomposition of urea in aquaponic systems.

Because this technology also greatly reduces the risk of cross-contamination, disposable bags are preferred in applications in which an absolute or improved process safety is a necessity, namely the production of functional tissue for implantation (tissue engineering), the production of human cells for the treatment of cancer and immune system diseases (cellular therapy), the production of viruses for gene therapies, the production of therapeutic proteins, and veterinary as well as human vaccines. Bioreactors with a pre-sterile cultivation bag made of plastic material are currently used in both development and manufacturing processes primarily operating with animal and human cells at small- and middle-volume scale. Because of their scalability, hydrodynamic expertise and the convincing results of oxygen transport efficiency studies, wave-mixed bioreactors are the most used, together with stirred bag bioreactors and static bags, which have the longest tradition. Starting with a general overview of disposable bag bioreactors and their main applications, this chapter summarizes the working principles and engineering aspects of bag bioreactors suitable for cell expansion, formation of functional tissue and production of therapeutic agents.

This finite-volume multiphysics approach, solves the laminar momentum and copper-ion species conservation equations, as well as local copper-ion conversion kinetics. It uses a Boussinesq approximation to simulate the species-momentum coupling, namely natural draft forces induced by variations of the spatial copper concentration within the fluid.

The torsional motion is handled as an anharmonic reaction coordinate in detail, whereas all the remaining degrees of freedom are taken into account approximately. We predict how stereomutation is catalyzed or inhibited by excitation of the various vibrational modes. The agreement of our theoretical results with spectroscopic data from the literature on HS and DS is excellent. We furthermore predict the influence of parity violation on stereomutation as characterized approximately by the ratio (ΔEpv/ΔE±) of the (local or vibrationally averaged) parity violating potential ΔEpv and the tunneling splittings ΔE± in the symmetrical case. This ratio is exceedingly small for the reference molecules HO and DO, and still very small (⋅− cm−) for HS, which, thus, all exhibit essentially parity conservation in the dynamics.

Pooled under the term sustainability any kind of process is nowadays evaluated against the background of used resources such as for example water, energy, pollution or manpower. Creating a detailed examination of sustainability, one is faced with the challenge of where to draw the system boundaries. Driven by the wish of going into detail of one special process those examinations get more and more individualized depending on the circumstances of production on site. This individualisation makes the examinations labour intensive and hard to use when comparing among each other. Transferred to grape harvest, the regie time such as driving to the vineyard and back into the winery, manoeuvres on site as well as which motor pool and mode of grape transportation is used, has a crucial influence on the final result of the examination while there is no grape harvested jet. For an easier way of comparing different modes of harvest on differently shaped vineyards it is proposed to separate this time from the process time, the time of actually harvesting grapes. As the harvest is a dynamic process the time implicit a certain distance. As functional unit the covered distance in meter to harvest a defined grape quantity [m / kg] can be applied. This unit depends on the variables row length and crop yield only and can even be applied to grape production processes. Different modes of action in the vineyard can be compared among each other more easily. For a more detailed examination the covered distance during both, regie and process time, can be summed up and transformed into energy according to the used motor pool and subsequently expressed in CO- equivalents. This approach was used to find the best matching field geometry for a low energy consuming grape harvest, evaluating harvesting by hand or machine. The model shows the expected diminishing marginal utility of row length at a given crop yield or vice versa the minimum crop yield for a given row length concerning minimizing the driven meters per kilogram of grapes.","doc_id":18309,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"67","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4119","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Cisgenic approach for improved disease resistance in apple","authors":"Broggini, GAL; Durel, CE; Vergne, E; Chevreau, E; Fahrentrapp, Johannes; Vanblaere, T; Peil, A; Flachowsky, H; Hanke, MV; Krens, FA; Schouten, HJ; Gessler, Cesare","subject":"Resistance gene; Apple; Weinbau; Disease;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"634","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Cisgenic approach for improved disease resistance in apple; Resistance gene; Apple; Weinbau; Disease;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft; Swiss and more generally European apple (Malus × domestica) production is hampered by several diseases, the most destructive being fire blight, caused by Erwinia amylovora. On the other hand, there are apple scab, caused by Venturia inaequalis and powdery mildew, caused by Podosphaera leucotricha, which represent the major phytosanitary problems. Classical breeding has produced many scab and mildew resistant cultivars and efforts to breed also fire blight resistant cultivars are currently undertaken. Marker assisted selection (MAS) increases efficiency by allowing early non-destructive screening of seedlings and identifying genotypes showing pyramids of resistance genes. If the development of markers for MAS was the primary goal of genetic analysis in the s, identification and cloning of resistance genes is now the goal. The first and until now the sole resistance gene which has been isolated and transformed into a susceptible apple cultivar is the gene HcrVf (Rvi), responsible for the Vf scab resistance present in most classically bred scab resistant cultivars. Much effort is currently spent in the identification and positional cloning of other apple genes conferring resistance to apple scab and fire blight. In our labs, we identified the putative scab resistance gene Rvi and two fire blight resistance genes namely from ‘Evereste’ and Malus × robusta . The functionality of these candidate genes is currently under scrutiny by complementation experiments. However, the final goal is the creation of a product, e.g., an improved apple cultivar that is resistant to scab and fire blight. The ideal product would have advantages to the environment and producer, and should raise as little concern as possible with consumers. To accomplish this ‘ideal product’, we opted for the cisgenic approach by introducing the scab resistance gene HcrVf with its own regulatory sequences into the highly susceptible apple cultivar, ‘Gala’, through Agrobacterium transformation. All marker genes were eliminated after transformation. Similarly, we are currently introducing into both the readily developed cisgenic ‘Gala’ and in the untransformed ‘Gala’ the putative Malus own fire blight resistance gene candidates, aiming at both proof of functionality of the identified candidates and possibly at rapid development of a fire blight and scab resistant cisgenic apple.","doc_id":18524,"prior":"destructive","sdg14":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1948","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The Romanian Grassland Database (RGD): historical background, current status and future perspectives","authors":"Vassilev, Kiril; Ruprecht, E.; Alexiu, V.; Becker, T.; Beldean, M.; Biță-Nicolae, C.; Csergő, A.M.; Dzhovanova, I.; Filipova, E.; Frink, J.P.; Gafta, D.; Georgieva, M.; Germany, M.S.; Goia, I.; Gumus, M.; Hennekens, S.M.; Janišová, M.; Knollová, I.; Koleva, V.; Kostadinova, S.; Kuzmanović, N.; Loos, J.; Mardari, C.; Michl, T.; Neblea, M.A.; Nicoară, R.I.; Novák, P.; Öllerer, K.; Onete, M.; Palpurina, S.; Paulini, I.; Pedashenko, H.; Pușcaș, M.; Roman, A.; Šibík, J.; Sîrbu, C.; Stancu, D.; Sutcliffe, L.; Szabó, A.; Tomescu, C.-V.; Totev, E.; Tsvetanov, B.; Turtureanu, P.D.; Vassileva, P.; Velev, N.; Dengler, Jürgen","subject":"Ecoinformatics; Vegetation-plot database; Grassland ecology; Romania;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"The Romanian Grassland Database (RGD): historical background, current status and future perspectives; Ecoinformatics; Vegetation-plot database; Grassland ecology; Romania;  Ökologie; This report describes the Romanian Grassland Database (RGD), registered under EU-RO- in the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD).

But as large and important as these targets are, they will not be adopted by the public as long as they are not cost-effective, lifestyle-compatible and environmentally friendly throughout the value chain. That is why we opted to evaluate new approaches for generating electricity along the CO methanation value chain with reference to all these perspectives, and to consider their results not only in public policymaking, but also for strategic decisions in companies.The goal of this research project was to assess the whole CO methanation value chain regarding social, economic and environmental sustainability by comparing various scenarios from cradle to grave.The results for the environmental sustainability depend substantially on the type of electricity used for the hydrogen production. The researchers identified a significant potential to reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, when comparing renewable and fossil methane value chains. The reason for this reduction potential is the fact that the combustion of fossil methane releases carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming whereas the direct carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of synthetic methane are equal to the carbon dioxide amount used as input in the methanation process and therefore are climate neutral. The economic investigation dealt with the calculation of the possible investment and operating costs in comparison to the currently found base scenario. In summary, it can be said that there are ways to break away from the dependency of fossil natural gas to produce self-sufficient renewable methane within Switzerland. With improvements in efficiencies, increased transit and operating times, the use of energy flows below process steps, and increased maintenance intervals, especially new technologies, there are many ways to minimize the cost difference. More accurate statements require more thorough detailed investigations. On the social dimension, it can be said that the processes involved in the subprojects are not of more concern than normal Swiss industrial activities. However, attention must be paid at the provenance of bulk materials, especially of metals (copper) and conflict minerals, cassiterite (tin), wolframite (for tungsten), coltan (for tantalum), and gold ore. For the assessed subprojects the critical materials are usually the catalysts (nickel or metals of the platinum group). It was discovered that the supply chains are usually untraceable, making it impossible to trace the exact provenance location and their respective social conditions. A strategy to fight this issue is for the Swiss companies to demand more transparency for the purchased bulk materials.The findings of this research project revealed the social, economic and environmental hotspots of the whole CO methanation value chain, which can be used by the researchers in the single subprojects and later by the implementing industry to improve the sustainability of their endproducts. The findings and recommendations of this research project are important for decision making in policy with regard to the energy strategy  and for industries to improve their sustainability performances, e.g. by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","doc_id":18782,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"12","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19267","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Kommunikations- und Sensibilisierungsstrategien zu Grossraubtieren im Naturpark Beverin","authors":"Hohl, Samirah","subject":"Wolf (Canis lupus); Braunbär (Ursus arctor); Luchs (Lynx lynx); Graubünden; Regionaler Naturpark Beverin; Kommunikation; Information; Grrossraubtiere;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"000, 590","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Kommunikations- und Sensibilisierungsstrategien zu Grossraubtieren im Naturpark Beverin; Wolf (Canis lupus); Braunbär (Ursus arctor); Luchs (Lynx lynx); Graubünden; Regionaler Naturpark Beverin; Kommunikation; Information; Grrossraubtiere;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Tiere (Zoologie); Die Rückkehr der Grossraubtiere Wolf, Braunbär und Luchs in die Schweiz verursacht bei der Bevölkerung grosse Unsicherheiten. Als im Sommer  im Perimeter des Naturpark Beverin ein neues Wolfsrudel mit elf Individuen nachgewiesen wurde, bestätigten Gespräche mit betroffenen Personen, dass das Bedürfnis nach transparenten Informationen zu Grossraubtieren extrem gross ist. Um ein konfliktarmes Nebeneinander von Menschen und Grossraubtieren in der Kulturlandschaft Graubündens zu fördern, möchte der Naturpark Beverin deshalb als Wissensträger, Dienstleister und Vermittler der Region im Umgang mit Grossraubtieren die Information der Bevölkerung verbessern.Im Auftrag des Naturpark Beverin wurde in der vorliegenden Bachelorarbeit der Informationsbedarf der Bevölkerung ermittelt sowie ein Kommunikationskonzept erarbeitet, damit die Grossraubtierthematik neutral und sachlich vermittelt werden kann. Experteninterviews mit betroffenen Akteuren und eine Umfrage zum Informationsbedürfnis der Bevölkerung deckten die Kommunikationslücken Verhaltensregeln, lokale Hintergrundinformationen, Rechtslage und Biologie der Grossraubtiere auf. Damit diese Informationen wie gewünscht bei den Empfängern ankommen, dürfen die Fakten nicht nur präsentiert werden, sondern sie müssen sich wirklich wahr anfühlen. Aus diesem Grund enthält das Konzept wichtige Hilfestellungen für eine zielgruppenorientierte und transparente Kommunikation. Die entwickelte Kommunikationsstrategie wurde mit dem Aufbau der Beta-Version der Internetseite www.infoplattform-grossraubtiere.ch direkt umgesetzt. Dort wird das bestehende, umfangreiche Wissen zu Grossraubtieren in einer Informationssammlung strukturiert bereitgestellt, während zusätzlich auf einem Blog laufend regionale und aktuelle Informationen zu Grossraubtieren veröffentlicht werden können.

This study quantified the contribution of intermittent streams to the total length of the stream network along with an ecological assessment during spring-summer of headwater streams (higher than , m above sea level) in the Val Roseg, a high Alpine glacial catchment. Stream network mapping revealed that ca.  % (. km) of the drainage network consisted of intermittent streams. Glacier-fed headwaters experienced diel surface flows in late spring and summer, most going dry during the night due to reduced glacial inputs. In contrast, groundwater-fed streams often went dry in summer with the contraction of groundwater and other subsurface inputs. A principal components analysis of physico-chemical characteristics revealed headwaters to be primarily glacial-fed (kryal), groundwater-fed (krenal), or having a mixed water source. Although quite variable, periphyton biomass reached high levels (ca.  mg m- chla,  g m- AFDM) by late spring in most headwaters. Organic matter in transport (seston) ranged from . to . mg L- mostly consisting of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM: – %). Hyporheic sediment respiration rates varied considerably, ranging from . to . mg O h- kg- sediment and primarily related to the amount of loosely attached organic matter. These results indicate that intermittent streams are predominant in alpine landscapes, comprising mostly st to nd order systems, and that ecosystem properties vary substantially among headwater streams likely in relation to annual/daily changes in flow and water source. Such headwaters may contribute strongly to the production, processing and transport of organic matter to downstream waters, especially in light of the expected increase in intermittent streams in alpine catchments experiencing rapid glacial recession.","doc_id":18950,"prior":"sea","sdg14":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7128","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Spatio-temporal heterogeneity of actual and potential respiration in two contrasting floodplains","authors":"Mori, N.; Brancelj, A.; Simcic, T.; Robinson, C.T.; Döring, Michael","subject":"Floodplain; Respiration; Function; Hetererogeneity;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Spatio-temporal heterogeneity of actual and potential respiration in two contrasting floodplains; Floodplain; Respiration; Function; Hetererogeneity;  Ökologie; Floodplains are vital components of river ecosystems and play an important role in carbon cycling and storage at catchment and global scales. For efficient river management and conservation, it is critical to understand the functional role of spatiotemporally complex and dynamic habitat mosaics of river floodplains. Unfortunately, the fundamental understanding of mineralization and carbon flux patterns across complex floodplains is still fragmentary. In this study, respiratory potential (i.e., electron transport system activity – ETSA) was quantified seasonally across different aquatic and terrestrial habitats (wetted channels, gravel bars, islands, riparian forests and grasslands) of two Alpine floodplains differing in climate, altitude, discharge, flow alteration intensity and land use (Soča – natural flow regime, % grassland area; Urbach – mean annual discharge reduction by % due to water abstraction, % grassland area). In situ respiration (R) was measured and ETSA/R ratios calculated to examine differences in exploitation intensity of the overall respiratory capacity among floodplain habitats and seasons. ETSA and R provided potential and actual estimates, respectively, of organic matter mineralization in the different floodplain habitats. Hierarchical linear regression across habitat types showed organic matter, grain sizes  mm were also highly important for the Soča floodplain. The combination of ETSA and R measurements conducted in contrasting floodplains increased our understanding of the relationships between floodplain habitat heterogeneity, organic matter mineralization and human impacts; i.e., structural-functional linkages in floodplains. These data are integral towards predicting changes in floodplain function in response to environmental alterations from increasing human pressures and environmental change.","doc_id":18953,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"21","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24497","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Richtlinien Hochlagenbegrünung","authors":"Peters, Monique; Edelkraut, Kirsten; Schneider, Manuel; Rixen, Christian","subject":"Hochlagenbegrünung; Renaturierung; Standortgerecht; Alpin; Erosion; Naturwert; Landschaftswert; Ingenieurbiologie;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Buch","bid":"333.7","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Richtlinien Hochlagenbegrünung; Hochlagenbegrünung; Renaturierung; Standortgerecht; Alpin; Erosion; Naturwert; Landschaftswert; Ingenieurbiologie;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Ökosysteme in Hochlagen sind empfindliche und schützenswerte Lebensräume. Baumassnahmen, unsachgemässe landwirtschaftliche Nutzung und der Wintersport können Narben hinterlassen, welche durch angepasste Begrünungsmassnahmen zu beheben sind. Neben dem Schutz des Bodens vor Erosion sollen Begrünungen nicht nur die landschaftliche Attraktivität, sondern auch die reiche, perfekt an die alpinen Verhältnisse angepasste Artenvielfalt erhalten. Bei Beeinträchtigungen von schutzwürdigen Lebensräumen mit seltenen oder gefährdeten Arten wird die Wiederherstellung auch vom Gesetzgeber vorgeschrieben.Die Standortbedingungen der alpinen und subalpinen Höhenstufen lassen biologische und chemische Prozesse nur langsam ablaufen. Tiefe Temperaturen, Wind oder Bodenerosion führen zu sehr langsamer Bodenbildung. Die dadurch geringe Wasserspeicherkapazität und Nährstoffverfügbarkeit erschweren das Pflanzenwachstum. Die Entwicklung und Etablierung der heutigen Vegetationsdecke ist das Resultat von sehr lang andauernden Prozessen.Nach einer Störung durch bauliche Eingriffe oder durch natürliche Ereignisse erholt sich die Vegetation in Hochlagen nur sehr zögerlich. Zudem breiten sich die meisten Pflanzenarten in dieser Höhenlage vorwiegend vegetativ und weniger über Samen aus. Es ist äusserst wichtig, die bestehende Vegetation zu schützen und bestmöglich wiederanzulegen. Ein weiterer bedeutsamer Punkt ist der Aspekt des Bodenschutzes: Nur bewachsener Boden ist gegen Einflüsse wie Erosion und Auswaschung optimal geschützt. In den letzten Jahren haben Verfahren zur Wiederherstellung einer standortgerechten Vegetation im Alpenraum weiter an Bedeutung gewonnen. Bestmögliche Resultate erzielt man mit der direkten Wiederverwendung der intakten Pflanzendecke in Form von Soden, wenn nötig mit Zwischenlagerung. Aussaaten sind unumgänglich, wenn keine oder zu wenig Soden abgeschält werden können. Das Saatgut kann nass oder trocken aufgebracht werden. Die Samenmischung sollte regional sein, dem Standort angepasst und keine gebietsfremden Arten enthalten. Zusatzstoffe wie Kleber oder Mulch helfen bei der Keimung und Etablierung der Saat. Häufig werden Aussaaten im Spätherbst als Schlafsaat ausgebracht, damit sie im Frühjahr bei optimalen Bedingungen keimen.Um langfristig ökologischen und auch wirtschaftlichen Schaden zu vermeiden, lohnt es sich, qualitativ hochstehende Begrünungen zu realisieren, welche einen guten Erosionsschutz bieten und die Anliegen von Natur- und Landschaftsschutz grösstmöglich berücksichtigen.

Fragestellung und Methode: Der vorliegende Beitrag beschreibt anhand von Methoden der phänomenologischen Soziologie das Phänomen «Gewalt unter der Geburt» mit Blick subjektiv erlebte Erfahrung von Gebärenden vorderhand wertfrei und bearbeitet die Frage, weshalb Gewalt unter der Geburt «normal» ist, beziehungsweise weitläufig als erwart- und akzeptierbar gilt. Ergebnisse: Im Zuge einer lebensweltlich ausgerichteten Definition von Gewalt wird ein breiteres Verständnis vom Phänomen «Gewalt unter der Geburt» für die weitere wissenschaftliche Auseinandersetzung insbesondere im deutschsprachigen Raum vorgeschlagen. Dieses Verständnis beinhaltet die Gewalthaftigkeit der Geburt an sich genauso wie die mutmasslich legitime «fürsorgliche Gewalt» durch Geburtshelferinnen und Geburtshelfer die rechtlich illegale/illegitime Gewalt. Diese drei Arten der Gewalt sind für Gebärende subjektiv nicht leicht zu unterscheiden und zudem gesellschaftlich unterschiedlich gedeutet und normalisiert, weshalb nicht alle Betroffenen sich auch betroffen fühlen. Fazit: Im Spannungsfeld der Klinikgeburt und dem gesellschaftlich implizierten Ideal der «natürlichen Geburt» treffen unterschiedliche Erwartungen und Wertvorstellungen aneinander. Durch die zunehmende Zuschreibung von Entscheidungsfreiheit im medizinischen Kontext werden normalisierte und bisher legitimierte Betreuungsmodelle und Handlungen vermehrt in Frage gestellt. Forschung und Praxis könnten diese Entwicklung für eine Verbesserung der Geburtshilfe nutzbar machen.","doc_id":19004,"prior":"illegale","sdg14":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3069","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The Bulgarian Swiss joint research project PhytoBalk : an example of application of biotechnological methods for the conservation of valuable medicinal plants germplasm and region independent biotechnological production of plant derived pharmaceuticals","authors":"Wolfram, Evelyn; Meier, Beat; Danova, Kalina","subject":" Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"615","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"The Bulgarian Swiss joint research project PhytoBalk : an example of application of biotechnological methods for the conservation of valuable medicinal plants germplasm and region independent biotechnological production of plant derived pharmaceuticals;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","doc_id":19061,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"89","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23036","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Smart sustainable cities of the new millennium : towards design for nature","authors":"Catalano, Chiara; Meslec, Mihaela; Boileau, Jules; Guarino, Riccardo; Aurich, Isabella; Baumann, Nathalie; Chartier, Frédéric; Dalix, Pascale; Deramond, Sophie; Laube, Patrick; Lee, Angela Ka Ki; Ochsner, Pascal; Pasturel, Marine; Soret, Marie; Moulherat, Sylvain","subject":"Urban ecology; DeMo; Biodiversity; Geodesign; GeoBIM; Holistic design; Design with nature;  Raumplanung (Städtebau)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"711","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Smart sustainable cities of the new millennium : towards design for nature; Urban ecology; DeMo; Biodiversity; Geodesign; GeoBIM; Holistic design; Design with nature;  Raumplanung (Städtebau); Urban environments consist of a mosaic of natural fragments, planned and unintentional habitats hosting both introduced and spontaneous species. The latter group exploits abandoned and degraded urban niches which, in the case of plants, forms what is called the Third Landscape. In the Anthropocene, cities, open spaces and buildings must be planned and designed considering not only human needs but also those of other living organisms. The scientific approach of habitat sharing is defined as Reconciliation Ecology, whilst the action of implementing the ecosystem services and functioning of such anthropogenic habitats is called Urban Rehabilitation. However, urban development still represents the main cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Yet, the approach of planners and landscape architects highly diverges from that of ecologists and scientists on how to perceive, define and design urban green and blue infrastructure. For instance, designers focus on the positive impact that Nature (generally associated with indoor and outdoor greeneries) has on human well-being, often neglecting ecosystems’ health. Instead, considering the negative impact of any form of development and to achieve the No Net Loss Aichi’s objectives, conservationists apply mitigation hierarchy policies to avoid or reduce the impact and to offset biodiversity. The rationale of this review paper is to set the fundamentals for a multidisciplinary design framework tackling the issue of biodiversity loss in the urban environment by design for Nature. The method focuses on the building/city/landscape scales and is enabled by emerging digital technologies, i.e. Geographic Information Systems, Building Information Modelling, ecological simulation and computational design.","doc_id":19124,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"90","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10917","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Ameisenverfügbarkeit im Grünland als Nahrung für den Wendehals","authors":"Henseler, Dominik","subject":"Wendehals; Jynx torquilla; Grünland; Extensive Weide; Extensive Wiese; Trockenweide; Trockenwiese; Ameise; Ameisenhügel; Ameisennest; Solothurner Jura;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333.7, 590","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Ameisenverfügbarkeit im Grünland als Nahrung für den Wendehals; Wendehals; Jynx torquilla; Grünland; Extensive Weide; Extensive Wiese; Trockenweide; Trockenwiese; Ameise; Ameisenhügel; Ameisennest; Solothurner Jura;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Tiere (Zoologie); Habitat deterioration due to the intensification of agriculture led to a severe decline of the Eurasian Wryneck (Jynx torquilla) population in Switzerland from the s to the s.

Dieser Brutvogel halboffener Lebensräume mit Grasfluren ist auf eine lückige Vegetation mit  -  % freiem Boden und grossem Ameisenreichtum angewiesen, wobei ihm die Ameisen in Form von Larven, Puppen und Imagines als Nahrungsressource dienen. Ein neues Förderprojekt der Schweizerischen Vogelwarte und BirdLife Schweiz in Zusammenarbeit mit lokalen Partnern hat zum Ziel, die Verbreitung des Wendehalses aus der Westschweiz weiter in die Kantone Bern, Solothurn und Aargau auszudehnen.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible ramifications for environmental quality in Russia during and following the coronavirus pandemic. Our work builds on the framework of Elinor Ostrom, as we argue that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown in Russia has highlighted the need for a more polycentric, de-centralized approach to environmental protection. We provide evidence for this point using a novel econometric strategy: given the tight centralization of environmental policymaking, we proxy for de facto decentralization using the amount of influence a regional governor has at the federal level. Using timely data on pollution in major Russian cities both before and during the pandemic, we employ an instrumental variable analysis which shows that pollution in a particular Russian region is negatively related to the amount of influence a Russian governor has at the federal level. Thus, the more powerful a governor is in their ability to set their own course, the better results they have in environmental quality. We conclude that Russia's environmental policy needs a fundamental rethink – and extensive decentralization – in a post-COVID- world.","doc_id":19182,"prior":"pollution","sdg14":1},{"id":"21","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11035","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Integrativer Managementplan für eine Trockenweide nationaler Bedeutung in Ausserberg (VS) unter spezieller Berücksichtigung des Sefistrauchs (Juniperus sabina)","authors":"Reinhard, Stefanie","subject":"Pflegeplan; Bewirtschaftung TWW; Extensive Weide; Extensive Wiese; Landschaftspflege; Erhalt Kulturlandschaft; Sukzession;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333.7, 577","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Integrativer Managementplan für eine Trockenweide nationaler Bedeutung in Ausserberg (VS) unter spezieller Berücksichtigung des Sefistrauchs (Juniperus sabina); Pflegeplan; Bewirtschaftung TWW; Extensive Weide; Extensive Wiese; Landschaftspflege; Erhalt Kulturlandschaft; Sukzession;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie; Biodiversity and structure-rich open landscapes are the effects of human influence over thousand years.

Furthermore, it relieves teachers and strengthens the self-perception of their profession. Finally, it facilitates a successful development of all-day schools.However, multi-professional cooperation is also described as a field of tension (Merten / Kaegi ) and high expectations are placed on a fruitful cooperative culture of teachers, social work staff and third-party providers at all-day school.The present symposium focuses on two aspects of multi-professional cooperation: First, we examine the meaning and understanding of professional cooperation from the perspective of the involved professionals on an abstract level. Second, on a concrete level, we consider the arrangement, the design and experience in all-day schools gained so far. Based on four research papers from Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and USA with qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches, the two aspects mentioned above are addressed and discussed.  Germany already has a -year experience of all-day schools. Against this background, the first contribution focuses on the research project MuTiG in the field of teacher training. The goal of this project is to enhance the prerequisites for productive collaboration between teachers and social workers, who are often part of the multi-professional teams in all-day schools.The city of Zurich is the first Swiss municipality, which has started to introduce comprehensive all-day schools. The SNSF research project AusTEr examines processes of negotiating pedagogic responsibilities in multi-professional teams in the transformation of regular schools to all-day schools in the city of Zurich. This second contribution is based on the assumption that multi-professional cooperation does not gain relevance simply because of proximity in space, but because it is a declared goal to build strong partnerships between educators and teachers.Another concept of all-day schools exists in Sweden, where the Swedish Leisure Time Center (LTC) cooperates with the compulsory school on different levels. This third contribution focuses on the concept of transition between the different pedagogical practices and shows how it is perceived from a teacher’s perspective. The fourth paper presents findings from a study on all-day schools in socially disadvantaged areas in New York (Children's Aid Society Community Schools). This contribution analyses the collaboration between teachers and social work staff and third-party providers.The aim of the symposium is to address and explore questions about successful and unsuccessful types of multi-professional cooperation in different all-day school concepts. It will access and evaluate their benefits and limits with regard to professional self-perception and understanding.","doc_id":19351,"prior":"Fischer","sdg14":1},{"id":"12","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24596","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"A comparative analysis of trajectory similarity measures","authors":"Tao, Yaguang; Both, Alan; Silveira, Rodrigo I.; Buchin, Kevin; Sijben, Stef; Purves, Ross S.; Laube, Patrick; Peng, Dongliang; Toohey, Kevin; Duckham, Matt","subject":"Trajectory similarity; Movement analytics; Similarity measure; Network-constrained movement;  Naturwissenschaften;  Mathematik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"500, 510","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"A comparative analysis of trajectory similarity measures; Trajectory similarity; Movement analytics; Similarity measure; Network-constrained movement;  Naturwissenschaften;  Mathematik; Computing trajectory similarity is a fundamental operation in movement analytics, required in search, clustering, and classification of trajectories, for example. Yet the range of different but interrelated trajectory similarity measures can be bewildering for researchers and practitioners alike. This paper describes a systematic comparison and methodical exploration of trajectory similarity measures. Specifically, this paper compares five of the most important and commonly used similarity measures: dynamic time warping (DTW), edit distance (EDR), longest common subsequence (LCSS), discrete Fréchet distance (DFD), and Fréchet distance (FD). The paper begins with a thorough conceptual and theoretical comparison. This comparison highlights the similarities and differences between measures in connection with six different characteristics, including their handling of a relative versus absolute time and space, tolerance to outliers, and computational efficiency. The paper further reports on an empirical evaluation of similarity in trajectories with contrasting properties: data about constrained bus movements in a transportation network, and the unconstrained movements of wading birds in a coastal environment. A set of four experiments: a. creates a measurement baseline by comparing similarity measures to a single trajectory subjected to various transformations; b. explores the behavior of similarity measures on network-constrained bus trajectories, grouped based on spatial and on temporal similarity; c. assesses similarity with respect to known behavioral annotations (flight and foraging of oystercatchers); and d. compares bird and bus activity to examine whether they are distinguishable based solely on their movement patterns. The results show that in all instances both the absolute value and the ordering of similarity may be sensitive to the choice of measure. In general, all measures were more able to distinguish spatial differences in trajectories than temporal differences. The paper concludes with a high-level summary of advice and recommendations for selecting and using trajectory similarity measures in practice, with conclusions spanning our three complementary perspectives: conceptual, theoretical, and empirical.","doc_id":19422,"prior":"coastal environment","sdg14":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22032","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Challenges of commercial aquaponics in Europe : beyond the hype","authors":"Turnsek, Maja; Joly, Agnes; Thorarinsdottir, Ragnheidur; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Innovation adoption; Gartner’s Hype Cycle;  Aquakultur","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"639.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Challenges of commercial aquaponics in Europe : beyond the hype; Aquaponics; Innovation adoption; Gartner’s Hype Cycle;  Aquakultur; In recent years, aquaponics has been receiving increased interest globally as a commercial food production technology and aquaponics start-up companies have been formed in most European countries.

However, surveys show that the aquaponic production in Europe is still very limited, and very few companies are economically viable. In order to obtain insights into the barriers to early development of commercial aquaponics, two surveys were carried out—one in Europe, which included France, and one in France alone, with a different protocol. Henceforth, for simplicity, the former will be referred to as Europe and the latter as France. The results reveal that the development of commercial aquaponics has hit the level of “disillusionment”, caused by numerous challenges facing commercial food production. As the understanding of the processes involved in aquaponics is increasing, it will be very interesting to follow the developments in the field over the coming years in order to ascertain whether aquaponics will follow the phases outlined by the “Gartner’s Hype Cycle” and thus proceed to become an established technology, or whether it will remain an “one hit wonder” and disappear in the “Trough of Disillusionment”.","doc_id":19426,"prior":"Aquakultur","sdg14":1},{"id":"33","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18676","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Innovations for future orientated food consumption : the environmental impact of refectory meals","authors":"Muir, Karen; Keller, Regula; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Life Cycle Assessment; Environmental impact;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"300, 333","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Innovations for future orientated food consumption : the environmental impact of refectory meals; Life Cycle Assessment; Environmental impact;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Goal: How can consumers be motivated to choose less environmentally impactful meals more frequently? How can those in the catering industry be motivated to offer more attractive, enjoyable, less resource intensive  choices? A multidisciplinary project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) aimed at fostering innovation along the value chain to reduce the undesirable consequences of the production and consumption of animal foodstuffs was carried out by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) along with various project partners. Part of the project involved social experiments carried out in the campus refectories, which are operated by the SV Group. The objectives of the SV Group are in line with the goals of the SNF research programme: to contribute to healthy and environmentally friendly nutrition. The goal of this subproject was to assess the environmental sustainability of  refectory meals including vegan and vegetarian options as well as meals containing meat or fish.These results of the project will be used to help steer refectory-users towards more sustainable choices, provide guidance to those in the catering industry, and can contribute to a decrease in the environmental impact resulting from the production and consumption of food.Methods: We assessed the environmental impacts of these meals according to these indicators:- Total environmental impact according to a Swiss ecological scarcity method - Greenhouse gas emissions according to IPCC - Ozone depletion, human toxicity, particulate matter, ionising radiation, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, water depletion, and mineral, fossil and renewable resource depletion according to the recommendation of Joint Research Council of the European Commission.The following aspects were considered: the ingredients, including their origin, the composition of any ready-prepared components, the most relevant kitchen appliance energy and material flows, energy requirements for preparation, rinsing and frozen storage in the refectories, freezing and the transport of frozen products, as well as food waste from storage, preparation and serving.Results: In terms of total environmental impact according to the Swiss ecological scarcity method , vegan meals are on average % below the average of all dishes, vegetarian meals % below the average and meals containing meat or fish are % above the average. In the category of dishes containing meat or fish, the overall environmental impact of meals containing veal or beef was higher than that of those containing chicken or fish. The carbon footprint of the meals analysed lies between . kg CO-eq and . kg CO-eq, with an average of . kg CO-eq per meal. Vegan menus are on average % below the average of all meals, vegetarian dishes % below the average and menus containing meat or fish are % above the average. The environmental impact of meat- or fish-containing meals was also determined to be highest for almost all indicators of the ICLD evaluation.

According to the police crime statistics,, stalking offenses were recorded in Germany in , with , suspects (including  adolescents) and , victims (including  adolescents) of these crimes being identified. However, one may presume a considerable number of unreported cases. The consequences for those affected by stalking range from impairment of social well-being and negative economic consequences to health and psychological problems.Objective: While there are first representative results regarding stalking experiences of adults in Germany, no such study among German adolescents is known so far. For this reason, this article is the first to determine the lifetime prevalence of stalking among German adolescents and to compare it with a sample of adults. In addition, it determines correlations with psychological well-being and problematic substance consumption.Method: The data of the present study originated from a representative survey of pupils in the federal state of Lower Saxony, in which in  , pupils gave information about their stalking experiences (sample: .% male, .%migration background, mean age . years). The adult study is a representative victimization study on (sexual) violence experiences of N=, - to -year-olds in Germany, conducted in  (.% female, average age M= . years, SD= .; .% migration background).Recording of stalking experiences was based on other epidemiological studies by specifying  different individual behaviors. In estimating the lifetime prevalence of stalking, we chose a more liberal operationalization (i.e., experiencing at least one behavior at least twice). We assessed the group differences and correlations using T-tests and theχ-test and their corresponding effect sizes.Results: The results show a lifetime prevalence of .%, with girls being more affected than boys. In addition, those affected by stalking suffer more frequently from depression, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal tendencies and show higher rates of problematic substance consumption (alcohol and cannabis) than those unaffected. Again, these correlations are more evident in girls than in boys. Compared to the adult general population, adolescents are more affected by almost all stalking behaviors; this difference is particularly apparent in cyberstalking.Discussion and conclusion: In practice, it seems to make sense to educate students about stalking and the disregard of boundaries in partnerships. In addition, the criminal consequences of stalking should be explained, and it should be discussed how stalking can best be documented. Suitable contact persons should be named, and targeted support for those affected should be ensured.","doc_id":19629,"prior":"unreported","sdg14":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19813","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Grasslands of Northern Europe and the Baltic States","authors":"Dengler, Jürgen; Birge, Traci; Bruun, Hans Henrik; Rasomavicius, Valerijus; Rusina, Solvita","subject":"Grassland; Northern Europe;  Ökologie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Grasslands of Northern Europe and the Baltic States; Grassland; Northern Europe;  Ökologie; This chapter deals with the grasslands of Northern Europe (Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), with a focus on natural and semi-natural grasslands of the lowlands, thus treating arctic-alpine and strongly intensified types only marginally.

These results suggest that DMS and DMSP in coral zooxanthellae may be functioning as antioxidants, but further experiments are needed to substantiate this.","doc_id":19838,"prior":"sea","sdg14":1},{"id":"88","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8432","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Inpatient energy-management education (IEME) in groups : a feasibility study","authors":"Weise, Andrea; Kool, Jan; Barbero, Marco; Michel, Gisela; Hersche, Ruth","subject":"Occupational therapy; Energy conservation strategies; Multiple Sclerosis; Feasibility study; Patient education;  Ergotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"615.8515, 616.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Inpatient energy-management education (IEME) in groups : a feasibility study; Occupational therapy; Energy conservation strategies; Multiple Sclerosis; Feasibility study; Patient education;  Ergotherapie;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Alternative title: \"Three-week inpatient energy management education (IEME) for persons with multiple sclerosis related fatigue: A feasibility study\"","doc_id":19870,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"33","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4621","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Orientation-translation and orientation-orientation correlations in neopentane plastic crystals : computer simulation","authors":"Depondt, Philippe; Breymann, Wolfgang","subject":" Physik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"530","year":"1996","for_data_analysis":"Orientation-translation and orientation-orientation correlations in neopentane plastic crystals : computer simulation;  Physik; The dynamics of orientationally disordered crystals, such as neopentane C(CH), couple translational and orientational variables in a complex way. From the results of a molecular dynamics simulation of the orientationally disordered phase of neopentane, simple geometrical methods are used to define functions that can be displayed on a two-dimensional surface and yield practical information, and from these are obtained the single-molecule orientation-translation coupling, the coupling between the translation of a molecule and the orientation of one of its neighbours, and the orientation-orientation coupling of two neighbouring molecules. The single-molecule orientation-translation term, although weak, is consistent with experimental results. A distinct orientation-orientation coupling is visible when a C-C bond of one molecule points at a neighbouring molecule, while a bond of that neighbour points away from the former. Isotropy around the connecting vector tends to disqualify pseudospin-type models for neopentane. The most salient feature, however, is the strong two-molecule orientation-translation correlation, which confirms the motion of one molecule when a C-C bond of one of its neighbours points in its direction; up to now this was only inferred from partial experimental data. Predictions are made for the type of information that is likely to be obtained from neutron diffuse scattering.","doc_id":20100,"prior":"plastic","sdg14":1},{"id":"49","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19913","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Sensory-driven substitution of acrylate polymers with natural alternatives","authors":"Reichmuth, Nadine; Pedan, Vasilisa; Ott, Roman; Huber, Petra","subject":"Sensory analysis; Gelifying agent; Pre-screening tool; Rheology;  Technische Chemie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"660","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Sensory-driven substitution of acrylate polymers with natural alternatives; Sensory analysis; Gelifying agent; Pre-screening tool; Rheology;  Technische Chemie; Environmentalists are increasingly concerned about microplastics in the environment and are also critical of the use of liquid plastic in cosmetics putting the industry under pressure to find acceptable alternatives.

These climatic grids do not reflect conditions below vegetation canopies and near the ground surface, where critical ecosystem functions occur and most terrestrial species reside. Here, we provide global maps of soil temperature and bioclimatic variables at a -km resolution for - and - cm soil depth. These maps were created by calculating the difference (i.e. offset) between in situ soil temperature measurements, based on time series from over  -km pixels (summarized from  unique temperature sensors) across all the world's major terrestrial biomes, and coarse-grained air temperature estimates from ERA-Land (an atmospheric reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We show that mean annual soil temperature differs markedly from the corresponding gridded air temperature, by up to °C (mean = . ± .°C), with substantial variation across biomes and seasons. Over the year, soils in cold and/or dry biomes are substantially warmer (+. ± .°C) than gridded air temperature, whereas soils in warm and humid environments are on average slightly cooler (-. ± .°C). The observed substantial and biome-specific offsets emphasize that the projected impacts of climate and climate change on near-surface biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are inaccurately assessed when air rather than soil temperature is used, especially in cold environments. The global soil-related bioclimatic variables provided here are an important step forward for any application in ecology and related disciplines. Nevertheless, we highlight the need to fill remaining geographic gaps by collecting more in situ measurements of microclimate conditions to further enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of global soil temperature products for ecological applications.","doc_id":20178,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15380","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Broschüre 'Wandel in Wädenswil' : inhaltliche, konzeptionelle und gestalterische Grundlagen","authors":"Hollenstein, Sandra","subject":"Transition Towns; Nachhaltigkeitskommunikation; Umweltpsychologie; Umweltsoziologie; Value – Action Gap; Broschüre; Suffizienz; Kulturwandel; Kapitalismuskritik; Kampagne;  Gemeinschaften;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"307, 333.7","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Broschüre \"Wandel in Wädenswil\" : inhaltliche, konzeptionelle und gestalterische Grundlagen; Transition Towns; Nachhaltigkeitskommunikation; Umweltpsychologie; Umweltsoziologie; Value – Action Gap; Broschüre; Suffizienz; Kulturwandel; Kapitalismuskritik; Kampagne;  Gemeinschaften;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Globale und lokale ökologische, soziale und auch wirtschaftliche Probleme gehen mit unserer Lebens- und Wirtschaftsweise einher.

Furthermore, such populations frequently show adaptations to local conditions which, in turn, may enhance the ability of a species to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In conservation biology, peripheral populations are therefore of particular interest.  In northern Switzerland and southern Germany, Libelloides coccajus is an example of such a peripheral species. Assuming that suitable oviposition sites are crucial to its long-term survival, we compared oviposition sites and adjacent control plots with regard to structure and composition of the vegetation. Vegetation structure at and around oviposition sites seems to follow fairly stringent rules leading to at least two benefits for the egg clutches: (i) reduced risk of contact with adjacent plants, avoiding delayed drying after rainfall or morning dew and (ii) reduced shading and therefore higher temperatures. Furthermore, the study showed that it is possible to successfully create secondary habitats for L. coccajus, as shown by a road verge in one of our study areas.

As a result, steppes are scattered and rarely preserved in highly transformed landscapes. Steppe patches have often remained on sites with cultural importance, such as ancient burial mounds (kurgans), old cemeteries or ancient settlements (earthworks). Thus, not only natural but also cultural objects could show a high conservation value. We hypothesised that ancient settlements (rd – nd century BC) may act as steppe habitat islands, equally important as e.g. burial mounds for steppe plant protection. The aim of this study was to examine the local and landscape factors affecting vascular plants’ richness patterns in ancient settlements and to check the importance of such ancient settlements for nature conservation. We asked the following questions: ) How high is the species richness of vascular plants on ancient settlements? ) Do ancient settlements have a nature conservation value comparable to other steppe enclaves of the studied zone? ) Which factors are the most important for the species richness and species composition in ancient settlements? We analysed total richness and its separate categories as dependent variables in simple regressions against seven environmental variables such as ancient settlement’s area, microhabitat variety index, afforestation degree, steppe cover in  km buffer around an ancient settlement, distance to the closest settlements, area of settlements in  km buffer around an ancient settlement and mean annual precipitation. In  studied ancient settlements located in the Lower Dnipro basin (Southern Ukraine), we recorded a considerable number of native ( species, .%), steppe ( species, .%) and non-synanthropic plants ( species, .%), which indicated a good state of preservation of the steppe on these objects. The microhabitat variety index, as a measure of habitat heterogeneity, appeared to be the most significant positive predictor of total species richness, followed by ancient settlement’s area, afforestation degree and steppe cover around the ancient settlements. The same factors were significant for the richness of non-synanthropic plants. Distance to settlements was a significant negative predictor for established alien species richness. Our study confirmed that ancient settlements are valuable enclaves of steppe flora, surprisingly species-rich and of relatively high ratio of steppe and non-synanthropic plants compared to the flora of nature reserves and kurgans. Our results could help to better plan active protection of plant diversity on ancient settlements, e.g. through steppe restoration around the ancient settlements, maintenance of small-scale disturbance and microhabitat diversity (pastures, mown areas, burnt areas, loess or limestone extraction sites etc.) and limiting afforestation to a certain degree.","doc_id":20339,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8964","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Photografting of perfluoroalkanes onto polyethylene surfaces via azide/nitrene chemistry","authors":"Siegmann, Konstantin; Inauen, Jan; Villamaina, Diego; Winkler, Martin","subject":"Nitrene; Azide; Insertion; Polyethylene; Photografting; Perfluorinated compounds;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Photografting of perfluoroalkanes onto polyethylene surfaces via azide/nitrene chemistry; Nitrene; Azide; Insertion; Polyethylene; Photografting; Perfluorinated compounds;  Technische Chemie; The purpose of this study is to render polyethylene surfaces strongly and permanently hydrophobic. Polyethylene is a common plastic and, because of its inertness, difficult to graft. We chose polyethylene as example because of its ubiquity and model character. As graft chains linear perfluoroalkyl residues (−CF, −CF, −CF and −CF) were chosen, and photografting was selected as grafting method.Photolytically generated nitrenes can insert into carbon–hydrogen bonds and are therefore suited for binding to polyethylene. Hydrophobic photo reactive surface modifiers based on azide/nitrene chemistry are designed, synthesized in high yield and characterized. Four new molecules are described. Water contact angles exceeding ° were achieved on grafted polyethylene.One problem is to demonstrate that the photografted surface modifiers are bound covalently to the polyethylene.

However, it remains unclear how flow alteration and hydrological disturbance impacts the structure and biodiversity of complex microbial communities in these ecosystems. Here, we examined the spatial and seasonal dynamics of microbial communities in aquatic (benthic) and terrestrial habitats of three hydrologically contrasting (natural flow, residual flow, hydropeaking flow) floodplain systems. Microbial communities (alpha and beta diversity) differed more among floodplain habitats than between riverine floodplains. Microbial communities in all systems displayed congruent seasonal effects. In the residual and hydropeaking systems, an experimental flood was released from a reservoir to mimic a natural high flow event causing hydromorphological disturbance. The experimental flood caused a temporary shift in microbial communities by releasing microbes from the reservoir as well as redistributing communities among floodplain habitats. The flood-mediated shift in community structures had only a transient impact as pelagic bacteria did not persist within floodplain habitats over time after the flood. More frequent pulse disturbances might lead to an alternate structure of bacterial communities in floodplains over time.","doc_id":20757,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"45","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10479","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Highly convenient, clean, fast, and reliable Sonogashira coupling reactions promoted by aminophosphine-based pincer complexes of palladium performed under additive- and amine-free reaction conditions","authors":"Bolliger, Jeanne L.; Frech, Christian M.","subject":" Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"540","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Highly convenient, clean, fast, and reliable Sonogashira coupling reactions promoted by aminophosphine-based pincer complexes of palladium performed under additive- and amine-free reaction conditions;  Chemie; Sequential addition of ,′,′′‐phosphinetriyltripiperidine and ,‐diaminobenzene or resorcinol to toluene solutions of (cyclooctadiene)palladium dichloride [Pd(cod)(Cl)] under nitrogen in “one pot” almost quantitatively yielded the aminophosphine‐based pincer complexes {[CH‐,‐(XP{piperidinyl})]Pd(Cl)} (X=NH ; X=O ).

In Gebieten mit typischen städtischen Baustrukturen, wie gründerzeitliche Blockrandbebauungen mit teilweiser gewerblicher Nutzung der Innenhöfe, sowie in den Industriegebieten, erreicht der Anteil der Flachdächer sogar %. In solchen Gebieten kann die Fläche der Flachdachbauten die Grünflächen am Boden oft deutlich übersteigen. In diesen stark verbauten, als stadtökologische Ungunststandorte zu bezeichnenden Gebieten ist demnach ein bedeutendes Potenzial für einen ökologischen Ausgleich durch Dachbegrünungen vorhanden. Anhand eines stadtökologischen Bewertungsverfahrens konnte abgeschätzt werden, dass sich mit einer vollständigen Begrünung der Flachdächer der grösste Teil der stadtökologischen Ungunstgebiete (nach Schulz ) in den Wertbereich der Übergangsgebiete verschieben lässt.Ergänzend und um eine weiterführende Differenzierung vornehmen zu können, wurde zusätzlich zur quantitativen Bestimmung des Flächenpotenzials die Bedeutung begrünter Dächer als Lebensraum für die städtische Fauna auch quantitativ untersucht. In einem Zeitraum von drei Jahren wurden auf  begrünten Dächern in Basel sowie auf sieben in Luzern die Spinnen- und Käferzönosen erfasst. Dabei konnten total  Spinnen- bzw.  Käferarten erfasst werden, wobei  (%) der Spinnenarten als „faunistisch interessant“ (nach Pozzi et al. ) einzustufen waren bzw.  (%) der Käferarten als gefährdete Rote Liste-Art. Das erstaunliche Ausmass der Funde seltener Arten ergab sich in erster Linie durch den grossen Untersuchungsumfang. Die bisher bekannten, meist kürzeren Untersuchungen zur Fauna von Dachbegrünungen wiesen lediglich Einzelfunde seltener Arten aus. Daneben dürfte die Auswahl spezifisch strukturreich eingerichteter Dachbegrünungen für die Untersuchung sowie der generelle Artenreichtum an xerothermen Arten im Naturraum Basels zum Ergebnis beigetragen haben. Auf der artenreichsten Begrünung Rhypark in Basel konnten  Käferarten aus Roten Listen sowie sechs faunistisch interessante Spinnenarten gefunden werden. Es zeigte sich hier, dass mit einer zielorientierten Begrünungseinrichtung auf Flachdächern ein ökologischer Ausgleich geschaffen werden könnte, der für den Arten- und Naturschutz lokal bis regional bedeutend wäre.Diese Erkenntnisse decken sich mit Befunden einer botanischen Untersuchung von älteren begrünten Flachdächern in Wollishofen bei Zürich von Landolt (). Dort wurden reichhaltige Orchideenbestände und weitere, im östlichen Schweizerischen Mittelland gefährdete und seltene Arten gefunden. Von Landolt wird daher eine kantonaler Schutz vorgeschlagen.Mit der Untersuchung eines breiten Spektrums verschiedener Ausprägungsformen von Extensiven Dachbegrünungen zeigte sich auch eine grosse Varianz bezüglich der Bedeutung für den Arten- und Naturschutz. Auf geringmächtigen ausnivellierte Substrataufträgen war in der Regel ein nur sehr spärlicher Bewuchs vorhanden, der verbunden war mit beschränkten Etablierungsmöglichkeiten für seltene Spinnen- und Käferarten. Eine begleitende Untersuchung der Ausführungspraxis ergab, dass der überwiegende Anteil der aktuell eingerichteten Dachbegrünungen leider sehr geringmächtig sind. Es muss deshalb davon ausgegangen werden, dass sich auf den meisten neu entstehenden Dachbegrünungen nur artenarme Biozönosen entwickeln dürften.Nach dem Schweizerischen „Natur- und Heimatschutzgesetz“ (NHG) Abschnitt  ist der Schutz der einheimischen Pflanzen- und Tierwelt innerhalb und ausserhalb von Siedlungen vorgeschrieben. Insbesondere wird im NHG der Schutz von gefährdeten Arten und ihren Lebensräumen festgelegt. Die Erkenntnisse zur Varianz der ökologischen und insbesondere aus der Sicht des Arten- und Naturschutzes differierenden Bedeutung von extensiven Dachbegrünungen lassen demnach für die Richtlinien-, Planungs- und Ausführungskontrollpraxis Handlungsvorgaben ableiten. Vorgabe für Extensive Dachbegrünungen müsste sein, die Flächen so einzurichten, damit sie sich längerfristig in einem Zustand halten können, in dem möglichst viele gefährdete Arten auf ihnen Ersatzlebensräume finden können.Mit der dreijährigen Untersuchung auf spezifisch eingerichteten Flächen konnten erste konkrete Hinweise zur Funktionalität der Einrichtung von kleinen Hügeln erarbeitet werden, als stets leicht feucht bleibende Rückzugsorte für die Bodenfauna während den Trockenperioden im Sommer. Im Vergleich zu ausnivellierten Standorten konnte eine signifikante Zunahme der Artenvielfalt ermittelt werden.Als methodischer Ansatz wurde in vorliegender Arbeit das «Karlsruher Modell» (Henz ), welches zur Ermittlung von Eingriff und Ausgleich im Zuge von Bebauungsplanverfahren erarbeitet wurde, verwendet. Mit diesem Verfahren konnte das biotische Potenzial von Dachbegrünungen ansatzweise in Verbindung zu bodengebundenen Flächen gebracht werden. Dabei zeigte sich, dass artenreiche Dachbegrünungen, wie das Dach Rhypark, faunistische Bedeutung in der Grössenordnung von Brachflächen und Bahndämmen erreichen können. Solche Flächen sind in vielen Stadtgebieten Mitteleuropas heute Refugialstandorte seltener und schützenswerter xerothermer Arten.Für ökologische Stadtentwicklungskonzepte liess sich aus dem ermittelten ökologischen Ausgleichspotenzial von Extensiven Dachbegrünungen ableiten, dass Flachdächer konsequent und möglichst umfassend begrünt werden sollten. Unterstützende Förderprogramme und Massnahmen müssten dazu festgelegt werden. Insbesondere bei Überbauungsplanungen, bei denen arten- und naturschützerisch bedeutsame Habitate betroffen sind, wäre zwingend eine Begrünung vorzusehen, welche die Standortbedingungen der anliegenden Umgebung berücksichtigt.Für das Untersuchungsgebiet in Basel heisst dies konkret, dass bereits heute, und zwar vor der anstehenden Überbauung des artenreichen Gebietes des ehemaligen Güterbahnhofareals der Deutschen Bahn AG, versucht werden sollte, für möglichst viele von der Überbauung betroffenen Arten ideale Ersatzlebensräume durch Dachbegrünungen zu schaffen.","doc_id":21194,"prior":"Artenvielfalt","sdg14":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10461","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A plant sociological approach for extensive green roofs in Mediterranean areas","authors":"Catalano, Chiara; Guarino, Riccardo; Brenneisen, Stephan","subject":"Plant sociology; Hay transfer; Habitat replication; Biodiversity assessment;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333, 577","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"A plant sociological approach for extensive green roofs in Mediterranean areas; Plant sociology; Hay transfer; Habitat replication; Biodiversity assessment;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie; Extensive Green roofs can be an important mean for environmental mitigation if designed according to the principles of restoration ecology.

Inspired by plant sociology, this method also considers conservation issues, analysing whether the plants selected through our procedure were characteristic of habitats of conservation interest according to Swiss and European laws and directives. Selecting plant species with different life cycles and life traits may lead to higher plant species richness, which in turn may improve the functional complexity and the ecosystem services provided by green roofs and green infrastructure in general.","doc_id":21354,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"45","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8917","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Implications of potential future grand solar minimum for ozone layer and climate","authors":"Arsenovic, Pavle; Rozanov, Eugene; Anet, Julien; Stenke, Andrea; Schmutz, Werner; Peter, Thomas","subject":" Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"551","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Implications of potential future grand solar minimum for ozone layer and climate;  Geologie und Hydrologie; Continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are expected to cause further global warming throughout the st century. Understanding the role of natural forcings and their influence on global warming is thus of great interest. Here we investigate the impact of a recently proposed st century grand solar minimum on atmospheric chemistry and climate using the SOCOL-MPIOM chemistry-climate model with an interactive ocean element. We examine five model simulations for the period -, following the greenhouse gas concentration scenario RCP. and a range of different solar forcings. The reference simulation is forced by perpetual repetition of solar cycle  until the year . This reference is compared with grand solar minimum simulations, assuming a strong decline in solar activity of . and .Wm−, respectively, that last either until  or recover in the nd century. Decreased solar activity by .Wm− is found to yield up to a doubling of the GHG-induced stratospheric and mesospheric cooling. Under the grand solar minimum scenario, tropospheric temperatures are also projected to decrease compared to the reference. On the global scale a reduced solar forcing compensates for at most % of the expected greenhouse warming at the end of the st and around % at the end of the nd century. The regional effects are predicted to be significant, in particular in northern high-latitude winter. In the stratosphere, the reduction of around % of incoming ultraviolet radiation leads to a decrease in ozone production by up to %, which overcompensates for the anticipated ozone increase due to reduced stratospheric temperatures and an acceleration of the Brewer–Dobson circulation. This, in turn, leads to a delay in total ozone column recovery from anthropogenic halogen-induced depletion, with a global ozone recovery to the pre-ozone hole values happening only upon completion of the grand solar minimum.","doc_id":21448,"prior":"ocean","sdg14":1},{"id":"97","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22678","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Scale dependence of species–area relationships is widespread but generally weak in Palaearctic grasslands","authors":"Zhang, Jinhui; Gillet, François; Bartha, Sándor; Alatalo, Juha Mikael; Biurrun, Idoia; Dembicz, Iwona; Grytnes, John‐Arvid; Jaunatre, Renaud; Pielech, Remigiusz; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad; Vynokurov, Denys; Widmer, Stefan; Aleksanyan, Alla; Bhatta, Kuber Prasad; Campos, Juan Antonio; Czortek, Patryk; Dolezal, Jiri; Essl, Franz; García‐Mijangos, Itziar; Guarino, Riccardo; Güler, Behlül; Hájek, Michal; Kuzemko, Anna; Li, Frank Yonghong; Löbel, Swantje; Moradi, Halime; Naqinezhad, Alireza; Silva, Vasco; Šmerdová, Eva; Sonkoly, Judit; Stifter, Simon; Talebi, Amir; Török, Péter; White, Hannah; Wu, Jianshuang; Dengler, Jürgen","subject":"Beta diversity; Grassland; GrassPlot; Heterogeneity; Palaearctic; Power law; Rooted presence; Scale dependence; Shoot presence; Species–area relationship; Vegetation; Z-value;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 580","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Scale dependence of species–area relationships is widespread but generally weak in Palaearctic grasslands; Beta diversity; Grassland; GrassPlot; Heterogeneity; Palaearctic; Power law; Rooted presence; Scale dependence; Shoot presence; Species–area relationship; Vegetation; Z-value;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Questions: Species–area relationships (SARs) are fundamental for understanding biodiversity patterns and are generally well described by a power law with a constant exponent z. However, z-values sometimes vary across spatial scales. We asked whether there is a general scale dependence of z-values at fine spatial grains and which potential drivers influence it.Location: Palaearctic biogeographic realm.Methods: We used , nested-plot series of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens from the GrassPlot database with two or more grain sizes, ranging from . m² to , m² and covering diverse open habitats. The plots were recorded with two widespread sampling approaches (rooted presence = species “rooting” inside the plot; shoot presence = species with aerial parts inside). Using Generalized Additive Models, we tested for scale dependence of z-values by evaluating if the z-values differ with gran size and tested for differences between the sampling approaches. The response shapes of z-values to grain were classified by fitting Generalized Linear Models with logit link to each series. We tested whether the grain size where the maximum z-value occurred is driven by taxonomic group, biogeographic or ecological variables.Results: For rooted presence, we found a strong monotonous increase of z-values with grain sizes for all grain sizes below  m². For shoot presence, the scale dependence was much weaker, with hump-shaped curves prevailing. Among the environmental variables studied, latitude, vegetation type, naturalness and land use had strong effects, with z-values of secondary peaking at smaller grain sizes.Conclusions: The overall weak scale dependence of z-values underlines that the power function generally is appropriate to describe SARs within the studied grain sizes in continuous open vegetation, if recorded with the shoot presence method. When clear peaks of z-values occur, this can be seen as an expression of granularity of species composition, partly driven by abiotic environment.","doc_id":21500,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"84","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2357","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Effects of dietary exposure to zearalenone (ZEN) on carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)","authors":"Pietsch-Schmied, Constanze; Kersten, Susanne; Valenta, Hana; Dänicke, Sven; Schulz, Carsten; Burkhardt-Holm, Patricia; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Blood cell populations; Aquaculture; Feed quality; Genotoxicity;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Effects of dietary exposure to zearalenone (ZEN) on carp (Cyprinus carpio L.); Blood cell populations; Aquaculture; Feed quality; Genotoxicity;  Biochemie; The mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) is frequently contaminating animal feeds including feed used in aquaculture.

Therefore, we compare pre-industrial control simulations with (CHEM) and without (NOCHEM) interactive chemistry. In general, the influence of the chemistry on the mean state and the variability is small and mainly restricted to the stratosphere and mesosphere. The atmospheric dynamics mainly differ in polar regions, with slightly stronger polar vortices in the austral and boreal winter, respectively. The strengthening of the vortex is related to larger stratospheric temperature gradients, which are attributed to a parameterisation of the absorption of ozone and oxygen in different wavelength intervals, which is considered in the version with interactive chemistry only. A second reason for the temperature differences between CHEM and NOCHEM is related to diurnal variations in the ozone concentrations in the higher atmosphere, which are missing in NOCHEM. Furthermore, stratospheric water vapour concentrations substantially differ between the two experiments, but their effect on temperature is small. In both setups, the simulated intensity and variability of the northern polar vortex is inside the range of present-day observations.Additionally, the performance of SOCOL-MPIOM under changing external forcings is assessed for the period - using an ensemble of simulations. In the industrial period from  onward SOCOL-MPIOM overestimates the global mean surface air temperature increase in comparison to observational data sets. Sensitivity simulations show that this overestimation can be attributed to a combination of factors: the solar forcing reconstruction, the simulated ozone changes, and incomplete aerosol effects and land use changes.","doc_id":21702,"prior":"ocean","sdg14":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1511","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Grasslands of western and northern Europe – between intensification and abandonment","authors":"Dengler, Jürgen; Tischew, Sabine","subject":"Grassland; Conservation;  Ökologie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"577","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Grasslands of western and northern Europe – between intensification and abandonment; Grassland; Conservation;  Ökologie; About % of the territory of Western and Northern Europe (including the western part of Central Europe) is covered by grasslands.

Range maps from the Chorological Database Halle (CDH) were used as background reference data to capture species geographic ranges and to derive species climatic niches. To quantify sampling coverage, we developed a box‐counting method, the Dynamic Match Coefficient (DMC), which quantifies how much a set of occurrences of a given species matches with its geographic range or climatic niche. DMC is the area under the curve measuring the match between occurrence data and background reference (geographic range or climatic niche) across grids with variable resolution. High DMC values indicate good sampling coverage. We applied null models to compare observed DMC values with expectations from random distributions across species ranges and niches.Results: Comparisons with null models showed that, for most species, actual distributions within EVA are deviating from null model expectations and are more clumped than expected in both geographic and climatic space. Despite high interspecific variation, we found a positive relationship in DMC values between geographic and climatic space, but sampling coverage was in general more random across geographic space.Conclusion: Because DMC values are species‐specific and most biodiversity databases are clearly biased in terms of sampling coverage of species occurrences, we recommend using DMC values as covariates in macroecological models that use species as the observation unit.","doc_id":22059,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"3","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18362","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Thermoplastic high performance composite gears","authors":"Dennig, Hans-Jörg; Monn, Severino; Vodermayer, Albert","subject":"Zahnrad; Kunststoff;  Industrielle und handwerkliche Fertigung","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"670","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Thermoplastic high performance composite gears; Zahnrad; Kunststoff;  Industrielle und handwerkliche Fertigung; This paper describes the development and testing of gears based on polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and endless carbon fibers.

Yet, we lack basic information on how green roofs contribute to biodiversity and how their placement in the urban landscape aﬀects diﬀerent taxa and community composition. We studied the eﬀects of local and landscape variables on beetle communities on green roofs. We expected that both local roof characteristics and urban landscape composition shape communities, but that their relative importance depends on species characteristics. Using pitfall traps, we collected beetles during two consecutive years from  green roofs in Basel, Switzerland. We evaluated the contribution of six local and six landscape variables to beetle community structure and to the responses of individual species. Communities on the roofs consisted of mobile and open dryhabitat species, with both local and landscape variables playing a role in structuring these communities. At the individual species level, local roof variables were more important than characteristics of the surrounding urban landscape. The most inﬂuential factors aﬀecting the abundances of beetle species were vegetation, described as forb and grass cover (mainly positive), and roof age (mainly negative). Therefore, we suggest that the careful planning of green roofs with diverse vegetation is essential to increase their value as habitat for beetles. In addition, while beetle communities on green roofs can be diverse regardless of their placement in the urban landscape, the lack of wingless species indicates the need to increase the connectivity of green roofs to ground level habitats.","doc_id":22119,"prior":"biodiversity","sdg14":1},{"id":"67","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11552","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The legal status of cluster munitions under international humanitarian law : indiscriminate weapons of war","authors":"Black-Branch, Jonathan L.","subject":" Völkerrecht und Europarecht","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"341","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"The legal status of cluster munitions under international humanitarian law : indiscriminate weapons of war;  Völkerrecht und Europarecht; Recent developments regarding the Convention on Cluster Munitions highlight an important shift in thinking relating to the harm caused by cluster munitions, particularly post-military conflict.

Dadurch gehen wichtige Lebensräume für die einheimische Flora und Fauna verloren. Durch die Umzonung von Landwirtschaftsflächen in Bauland, schwinden wichtige Produktionsstandorte in den städtischen Gebieten. Dachbegrünungen können hier Abhilfe schaffen, in dem sie als Ersatzlebensraum und Produktionsfläche fungieren. Im  realisierte die Forschungsgruppe Stadtökologie der Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften ein Duales Dachbegrünungssystem auf dem Dach des Kehrichtheizkraftwerkes St. Gallen, welches diese beiden Aspekte vereint. Für den Artenschutz wurden Magerwiesen geschaffen und unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Urbanen Landwirtschaft wird in denselben Flächen Rebbau betrieben.Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde eruiert, ob sich der konträre Nährstoffhaushalt beider Nutzungsformen mit sich vereinbaren lässt und wie die Risikofaktoren in Einklang mit den Systemanforderungen gebracht werden können. Dazu wurden die Substrate der Magerwiesen und Rebtröge auf bodenökologische Faktoren untersucht sowie Vegetationsanalysen vorgenommen. Zudem wurde anhand der Trieblängen der Reben eine Vitalitätsbeurteilung durchgeführt.Aufgrund der Nährstoffanalysen konnte aufgezeigt werden, dass sich die Magerwiesen bei allen Sichtaufbauten und Substraten etabliere können. Beim Substrat der Rebtröge wurde ein Mangel der Makronährstoffe Phosphor und Stickstoff festgestellt, welcher die Ursache für die festgestellte Wachstumsdepression bei einem Teil der Reben sein könnte. Die Vegetationsanalysen zeigen, dass es sich um eine junge Vegetation handelt, die im Anfangsstadium ihrer Entwicklung steht. Aufgrund der undifferenzierten Zeigerwerte konnten keine Rückschlüsse auf die Standortbedingungen gezogen werden. Die Resultate der Nährstoffanalysen sind diesbezüglich aussagekräftiger.; More and more green space and fallow land in urban areas is being built upon due to the increasing demand for residential property, and because of quest for densification in new spatial planning. As a result, valuable habitats of our native Flora and Fauna is being lost. By rezoning agricultural land into building areas, important agrarian production space in urban environments is disappearing. Green roofs are one solution to this issue. They can serve as alternative habitats for plants and animals and they can also be used as agricultural production space. In , the Urban Ecology Research Group of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences implemented a dual roof greening system on the rooftop of the waste incineration plant located in St. Gallen. This green roof combines both aspects on the same building. Species conservation is realised in form of poor grassland and urban farming by viticulture.In the course of this thesis it was determined if the contrary nutrient balance of both forms of usage can be combined and how the risk factors can be reconciled with the system requirements. For this purpose, soil ecological factors on the substrates of the poor grasslands and viticulture area were researched. Furthermore, a vegetation analysis was conducted and the vitality of the vine was tested by measuring the length of the shoots.Based on the nutrient analyses it was possible to show that the stratum compositions and the substrates allows poor grasslands to establish themselves. The substrate of the viticulture area lacks of the macronutrients phosphor and nitrogen. This is probably the cause of the stunted growth observed in some vines. The results of the vegetation analysis showed that the vegetation on the rooftop of the waste incineration plant is still very young and in the initial state of its development. Due to the undifferentiated results of the indicator values, no conclusions about the ecological conditions could be made. The results of the nutrient analysis are more meaningful in this respect.","doc_id":22285,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"58","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19168","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Grasslands of Eastern Europe","authors":"Török, Péter; Dembicz, Iwona; Dajic-Stevanovic, Zora; Kuzemko, Anna","subject":"Grassland; Eastern Europe;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"333.7","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Grasslands of Eastern Europe; Grassland; Eastern Europe;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Grasslands cover around , km, corresponding to .% of the total area in the countries of Eastern Europe, here defined as East Europe, Eastern Central-Europe, and the non-Mediterranean part of the Balkan Peninsula.

Improved methods for the direct measurement of heat production as the signature function of brown adipocytes (BAs), particularly at the single cell level, would be of substantial benefit to these ongoing efforts. Here, we report the first application of a small molecule-type thermosensitive fluorescent dye, ERthermAC, to monitor thermogenesis in BAs derived from murine brown fat precursors and in human brown fat cells differentiated from human neck brown preadipocytes. ERthermAC accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum of BAs and displayed a marked change in fluorescence intensity in response to adrenergic stimulation of cells, which corresponded to temperature change. ERthermAC fluorescence intensity profiles were congruent with mitochondrial depolarisation events visualised by the JC- probe. Moreover, the averaged fluorescence intensity changes across a population of cells correlated well with dynamic changes such as thermal power, oxygen consumption, and extracellular acidification rates. These findings suggest ERthermAC as a promising new tool for studying thermogenic function in brown adipocytes of both murine and human origins.","doc_id":22365,"prior":"acidification","sdg14":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3417","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Aquaponic systems : nutrient recycling from fish wastewater by vegetable production","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Vegetables; Fish; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Aquaponic systems : nutrient recycling from fish wastewater by vegetable production; Aquaponics; Vegetables; Fish; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft; This chapter describes the possibility to combine wastewater treatment in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with the production of crop plants biomass.

A special design of trickling filters was used to provide nitrification of fish wastewater: Light-expanded clay aggregate (LECA) was filled in a layer of  cm in vegetable boxes, providing both surface for biofilm growth and cultivation area for crop plants. Aubergine, tomato and cucumber cultures were established in the LECA filter and nutrient removal rates calculated during - days.

It comprises extensive grasslands of different types and origin, which can be subdivided into () natural grasslands with (a) steppes (climatogenic in dry climates), (b) arctic-alpine grasslands (climatogenic in cold climates) and (c) azonal and extrazonal grasslands (pedogenic and topogenic) as well as () secondary grasslands created and sustained by human activities, such as livestock grazing, mowing or burning. Grasslands of the Palaearctic do not only form a major basis for the agriculture of the region and thus its food supply, but are also crucial for other ecosystem services and host a supraproportional part the realm’s plant and animal diversity. To reflect that suitability of grasslands for biodiversity strongly depends on their state, we apply the term High Nature Value (HNV) grassland to those natural grasslands that are not degraded (we call them in good state) and those secondary grasslands that are not intensified (we call them semi-natural). The synthesis at hand introduces seven comprehensive regional chapters organized by the Eurasian Dry Grassland Group (EDGG) on diversity, management and conservation of grasslands of the Palaearctic, covering nearly the complete extent of this realm. After introducing the EDGG as a leading international network dealing with these topics, we take advantage of the information compiled in the regional chapters and the expertise present among their  authors from  different countries to compile for the first time statistics on grassland types and areas as well as rankings of relative importance of factors reducing their biodiversity for the whole Palaearctic biogeographic realm and its major subdivisions (Western and Northern Europe; Eastern Europe; Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East; Russia; Kazakhstan and Middle Asia; China and Mongolia; Japan). We conclude that the current grassland area in the realm is about . million km²of which ca. % are natural (% steppes, % arctic-alpine grasslands, % azonal/extrazonal grasslands) and % secondary. The remaining natural grasslands overall represent about % of their original extent, but only % in Eastern Europe. Among the extant grasslands about / are of High Nature Value, with the highest fraction in the interior of the Eurasian continent and lowest values at its margins, namely Western Europe and Japan. Among the threat factors, abandonment or underuse were most important in general. Only in Russia, Kazakhstan and Middle Asia conversion of grasslands to arable lands was ranked first among the factors, as was eutrophication in Western and Northern Europe.

The authors established a method to perform exposure assays with resting eggs produced by the Daphnia longispina species complex, key species in large lake ecosystems. A mixture of organic contaminants previously detected in sediments of Lake Greifensee was selected to test the potential effect of organic contaminants present in sediments on the hatching process. Resting eggs were exposed to a mix of  chemicals, which included corrosion inhibitors, biocides, pesticides, and personal care products, for a period of  d.

Such an effect has not yet been reported from ecotoxicological assays with resting eggs. Possible mechanistic explanations as well as the potential implications on the ecology and evolution of aquatic species that rely on a resting egg banks are discussed. Observed increased mortality and developmental abnormalities for hatchlings in the exposure treatments can be explained by toxic contaminant concentrations.

We conducted an online experiment (N = ) to determine whether such interventions were more effective when they are communicated through formal social groups than when communicated through city governments.

Ansaldo Energia GT and GT gas turbine models address these requirements by employing a combustion system in which two lean premixed combustors are arranged in series. Due to the high inlet temperatures from the first stage, the second combustor stage predominantly relies on autoignition for flame stabilization. In this paper, the response of autoignition flames to temperature, pressure and velocity excitations is investigated. The gas turbine combustor geometry is represented by a backward-facing step. Based on the conservation equations an analytical model is derived by solving the linearized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. This is a commonly used analytical approach to describe the relation of thermodynamic quantities up- and downstream of a propagation stabilized flame. In particular, the linearized Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions are derived taking into account the presence of a moving discontinuity as well as upstream entropy inhomogeneities. The unsteady heat release rate of the flame is modeled as a linear superposition of flame transfer functions, accounting for velocity, pressure, and entropy disturbances, respectively. This results in a x flame transfer matrix relating both primitive acoustic variables and the temperature fluctuations across the flame. The obtained analytical expression is compared to large eddy simulations with excellent agreement. A discussion about the contribution of the single terms to the modeling effort is provided, with a focus on autoignition flames.","doc_id":23039,"prior":"conservation","sdg14":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11268","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Streckenanalyse Schalenwild im Gebiet Rigi (Wildraum 2)","authors":"Graf, Roland Felix; Bächtiger, Martina; Rempfler, Thomas; Robin, Klaus","subject":" Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333","year":"2008","for_data_analysis":"Streckenanalyse Schalenwild im Gebiet Rigi (Wildraum );  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Eine Veröffentlichung der Forschungsgruppe WILMA.

In addition to indwelling medical devices (implants, catheters, etc.), such infections may also result from adhesion of microbes either to external solid-water interfaces such as shower caps, taps, drains, etc, or to external solid-gas interfaces such as door handles, clothes, curtains, computer keyboards, etc. The latter are the main focus of the present work, where an overview of antimicrobial coatings for such applications is presented. The paper addresses well-established and novel methodologies, including chemical and physical functional modification of surfaces to reduce microbial contamination, as well as the potential risks associated to the implementation of such anti-contamination measures. Different chemistry-based approaches are discussed, in particular anti-adhesive surfaces (e.g., superhydrophobic, zwitterions, etc.) contact-killing surfaces (e.g., polymer brushes, phages, etc.) and biocide-releasing surfaces (e.g., triggered release, quorum sensing-based systems, etc.). The paper also assesses the impact of topographical modifications at distinct dimensions (micrometre and nanometre orders of magnitude) and the importance of applying safe-by-design criteria (toxicity, contribution for unwanted acquisition of antimicrobial resistance, long-term stability, etc.) when developing and implementing antimicrobial surfaces.","doc_id":23429,"prior":"contamination","sdg14":1}]
