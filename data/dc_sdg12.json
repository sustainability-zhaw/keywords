In this study, a virtual reality (VR) application was built from the insights and requirements of a focus group. The VR prototype was then validated using A/B-testing in an online experiment due to COVID- restrictions. VR is considered suitable for transferring information and building awareness regarding the topic of food waste. However, it is necessary to maintain the right balance between an informative and a serious gaming application. VR scenarios that people enjoy using have positive learning effects. Furthermore, scenarios that feature gamification elements are rated more highly regarding intention to use, which, in turn, benefits learning.","doc_id":15,"prior":"food waste","sdg12":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13678","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Transportmittelerkennung : Motivation, Ideen, Umsetzung und Validierung","authors":"Keller, Thomas; Bloch, Andreas; Erdin, Robert; Fueglistaler, Silas; de Spindler, Alexandre","subject":"Motivation; Umsetzung; Validierung; Transportmittelerkennung;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Transportmittelerkennung : Motivation, Ideen, Umsetzung und Validierung; Motivation; Umsetzung; Validierung; Transportmittelerkennung;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Können wir den CO-Ausstoss, welcher in der täglichen Mobilität anfällt steuern?

Despite the considerable growth, corresponding motives for consumption have not yet been researched more closely. This paper examines Swiss consumers’ motives and values underlying the consumption of craft beer. An empirical analysis was conducted based on the means-end chain approach. According to the means-end theory consumers link product attributes to consequences and to values. The perceived links between them determine the selection of attributes when making purchases. The data collection was based on a qualitative survey using the laddering method, which explicitly addresses the connections between concrete product attributes and higher order cognitive categories motivating behavior. The analysis of the laddering data showed that two predominant motives exist for the consumption of craft beer, both of which are individually oriented. First a desire for happiness by being cheerful and appreciating the good taste, and on the other a desire for an exciting life by being broad-minded and consuming something special. The results confirm the findings of other studies. Craft beer is not primarily consumed because of its functional benefits, but because of its meaning and identification with the product.","doc_id":180,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4111","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Gewinnung und Verwertung von Kakaopulpe in Honduras","authors":"Müller, Claudia; Streule, Stefanie; Brechbühler Peskova, Marie; Buchli, Jürg","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"630","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Gewinnung und Verwertung von Kakaopulpe in Honduras;  Landwirtschaft","doc_id":188,"prior":"Verwertung","sdg12":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14685","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Understanding product lifecycle management in manufacturing industries","authors":"Holler, Manuel","subject":" Produktionssteuerung","type":"Dissertation","bid":"658.5","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Understanding product lifecycle management in manufacturing industries;  Produktionssteuerung; In the digital age, manufacturing industries are in constant motion.

In order to fill this gap a feeding trial with juvenile carp was conducted. The fish were fed ZEN-contaminated diets at three concentrations (low:  μg kg−, medium:  μg kg−, and high:  μg kg− final feed, respectively) for four weeks. Possible reversible effects of ZEN were evaluated by feeding an additional group with the mycotoxin for four weeks period and the  uncontaminated diet for further two weeks. After that possible ZEN effects on enzyme activities in kidney, spleen, liver and muscle tissue were investigated to get an organism-wide aspect of ZEN effects. Most organs appeared to (over)compensate ZEN effects during the exposure to this mycotoxin, which caused metabolic costs. Oxygen consumption increased in fish treated with the two higher ZEN concentrations via the diet. The differences between the treatments persisted also after the recovery phase of two weeks. Thus, the present study provided evidence of effects of ZEN on carbohydrate metabolism, lipid peroxidation in organs and metabolic oxygen demand. This is the first evidence for increased metabolic costs in a fish species due to exposure to the mycotoxin ZEN.","doc_id":250,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23727","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Solving the trilemma : climate-friendly, healthy, and popular meals for retirement homes and canteens","authors":"Berger, Verena; Müller, Claudia; Egeler, Gian-Andrea; Muir, Karen; Bradford, Sebastian; Deluchi, Matteo; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"LCA; Food; Meal; Nutrition; Sustainable Food;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927, 640","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Solving the trilemma : climate-friendly, healthy, and popular meals for retirement homes and canteens; LCA; Food; Meal; Nutrition; Sustainable Food;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben; How can retirement homes and canteens transform their catering services into a sustainable business? Using life cycle based information, we developed a database with environmentally friendly, nutritionally balanced and popular meals for retirement homes and canteens. In order to create the database , the life cycle environmental impact of a large sample of  meals from municipal companies was assessed with the Ecological Scarcity Method. From this assessment a subsample of the most environmental friendly meals was selected. In the next step, the recipes were evaluated and optimized using nutritional balance models. Finally, the popularity of the meals  was determined based on sales data. Since the dietary requirements of residents in nursing homes differ greatly from those of guests in canteens, two different databases were created and tested with chefs for comprehensibility and user-friendliness. In addition to the environmental, nutritional, and popularity data for the meals, chefs were provided with the total environmental impact, global warming potential, and cumulative energy use for each constituent. Since factors such as origin, processing, packaging and seasonality differ for each meal preparation, these aspects were dynamically integrated as parameters into the database. Chefs can customize the parameters for their specific ingredients (e.g., from plastic to cardboard packaging) and the environmental impact is adjusted accordingly..With the developed database, the restaurant chefs are enabled to integrate life cycle thinking into their catering service and offer sustainable, healthy and popular meals.  Overall, the selection and optimization of meals reduced the average total environmental impact by % and the global warming potential by % compared to the original meals sample.","doc_id":310,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17778","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Dietary patterns and their sociodemographic and lifestyle determinants in Switzerland : results from the national nutrition survey menuCH","authors":"Krieger, Jean-Philippe; Pestoni, Giulia; Cabaset, Sophie; Brombach, Christine; Sych, Janice Marie; Schader, Christian; Faeh, David; Rohrmann, Sabine","subject":"24-h recall; Clustering; Dietary survey; Language region; Multinomial logistic regression; Cross-sectional study; Switzerland; Diet; Feeding behavior; Life style; Nutrition Survey; Socioeconomic factor;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613.2, 614","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Dietary patterns and their sociodemographic and lifestyle determinants in Switzerland : results from the national nutrition survey menuCH; -h recall; Clustering; Dietary survey; Language region; Multinomial logistic regression; Cross-sectional study; Switzerland; Diet; Feeding behavior; Life style; Nutrition Survey; Socioeconomic factor;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; From a public health perspective, determinants of diets are crucial to identify, but they remain unclear in Switzerland. Hence, we sought to define current dietary patterns and their sociodemographic and lifestyle determinants using the national nutrition survey menuCH (⁻, n = ). First, we applied multiple factorial analysis and hierarchical clustering on the energy-standardised daily consumption of  food categories. Four dietary patterns were identified (\"Swiss traditional\": high intakes of dairy products and chocolate, n = ; \"Western \": soft drinks and meat, n = ; \"Western \": alcohol, meat and starchy, n = ; and \"Prudent\": n = ). Second, we used multinomial logistic regression to examine the determinants of the four dietary patterns: ten sociodemographic or lifestyle factors (sex, age, body mass index, language region, nationality, marital status, income, physical activity, smoking status, and being on a weight-loss diet) were significantly associated with the dietary patterns. Notably, belonging to the French- and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland increased the odds of following a \"Prudent\" diet (Odds ratio [% confidence interval]: . [.⁻.] and .

Our findings highlight the influence of sociodemographic and lifestyle parameters on diet and the particularities of the language regions of Switzerland.

The present paper describes results one year after a behavior change intervention, called Social Power, aimed at reducing household electricity consumption using a gamified mobile application connected to a household’s smart meter. Between February and May , forty-two households in two Swiss cities were actively involved and monitored along with corresponding control group of forty households. The intervention engaged app users in a neighborhood challenge to complete electricity saving activities and realize their progress through electricity use visualization. One year after the intervention, electricity consumption was measured, and follow-up online surveys measured reported behavior and perceived injunctive norms of the participants. During the intervention, participants significantly reduced their electricity use, with respect to both historical consumption and the control groups. However, after one year it was found that the electricity savings achieved during the intervention were not maintained. In contrast, the participants reported their behavior as more efficient compared to before the intervention and still perceived the impact of the intervention in their community. This counter intuitive relation between the three measured variables is discussed, along with possible strategies to maintain the positive effects achieved in the short-term.","doc_id":346,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5907","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Teilen, tauschen und treffen im Quartier : Sharing Economy: Teilen und Teilhaben","authors":"Baur, Nicole Anja","subject":"Sharing; Economy; Community; Plattform; Online; Quartierarbeit;  Wirtschaft;  Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"330, 361","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Teilen, tauschen und treffen im Quartier : Sharing Economy: Teilen und Teilhaben; Sharing; Economy; Community; Plattform; Online; Quartierarbeit;  Wirtschaft;  Sozialarbeit und Sozialhilfe","doc_id":389,"prior":"Sharing Economy","sdg12":1},{"id":"23","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23930","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Performance analysis of secure elements for IoT","authors":"Noseda, Mario; Zimmerli, Lea; Schläpfer, Tobias; Rüst, Andreas","subject":"Cybersecurity; DTLS; Secure element; Embedded system; Resource-constrained device; Coaps; IoT;  Informatik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"004","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Performance analysis of secure elements for IoT; Cybersecurity; DTLS; Secure element; Embedded system; Resource-constrained device; Coaps; IoT;  Informatik; New protocol stacks provide wireless IPv connectivity down to low power embedded IoT devices. From a security point of view, this leads to high exposure of such IoT devices. Consequently, even though they are highly resource-constrained, these IoT devices need to fulfil similar security requirements as conventional computers. The challenge is to leverage well-known cybersecurity techniques for such devices without dramatically increasing power consumption (and therefore reducing battery lifetime) or the cost regarding memory sizes and required processor performance. Various semi-conductor vendors have introduced dedicated hardware devices, so-called secure elements that address these cryptographic challenges. Secure elements provide tamper-resistant memory and hardware-accelerated cryptographic computation support. Moreover, they can be used for mutual authentication with peers, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality, and various other security-related use cases. Nevertheless, publicly available performance figures on energy consumption and execution times are scarce. This paper introduces the concept of secure elements and provides a measurement setup for selected individual cryptographic primitives and a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) handshake over secure Constrained Application Protocol (CoAPs) in a realistic use case. Consequently, the paper presents quantitative results for the performance of five secure elements. Based on these results, we discuss the characteristics of the individual secure elements and supply developers with the information needed to select a suitable secure element for a specific application.","doc_id":394,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"66","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20022","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Classifying digital twins : a three-dimensional conceptual reference model","authors":"Barth, Linard; Ehrat, Matthias; Fuchs, Rainer","subject":"Classification; Conceptual model; Digital twin; Dimension;  Systeme;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"003, 005","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Classifying digital twins : a three-dimensional conceptual reference model; Classification; Conceptual model; Digital twin; Dimension;  Systeme;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; The  development  and  progress  in  information  and  communication  technology  will  transform traditional products into smart connected products and allow to offer novel smart services.

However, while efficient wastewater treatment is possible, the nutrient content of RAS water limits attainable microalgae biomass densities to – g/l at best, which requires frequent harvesting of microalgae. We have taken advantage of the constant evaporation of water from an open thin-layer photobioreactor (  l volume,   m illuminated surface, artificial supply of CO) to continuously add water from RAS to a microalgae culture and thereby provide nutrients for continued growth while evaporating all water. To test for a possible inhibitory effect of RAS water on microalgae growth, components of mineral medium were omitted stepwise in subsequent cultivations and replaced by RAS water as the only source of nutrients. This approach showed that microalgae can be grown successfully for up to three weeks in RAS water without additional nutrients and that high (  g/l) biomass densities can be attained. While growth in wastewater did not reach productivities measured in mineral medium, analysis of growth data suggested that this reduction was not due to an inhibitory effect of the RAS water but due to an insufficient supply rate of nutrients, even though RAS water contained up to   mg/l NO-N. It is, therefore, concluded that this method can be used to fully treat the wastewater discharge of a RAS. Furthermore, because both water evaporation from and microalgae growth in the photobioreactor correlated positively with each other due to their shared dependency on solar radiation, supply of nutrients continuously adjusts to changes in demand. It is estimated that the area of a photobioreactor required to treat all emissions of a RAS requires approximately . times the area of the latter.","doc_id":497,"prior":"wastewater","sdg12":1},{"id":"97","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15353","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Schoolchildren visit midwives","authors":"Albert, Katherina; Grieder, Sandra; Hailer-Bischoff, Therese","subject":" Bildung und Erziehung;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"370, 618","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Schoolchildren visit midwives;  Bildung und Erziehung;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: Midwives are sought-after experts when it comes to the teaching of pregnancy, birth and postpartum topics in primary schools. The Institute of Midwifery at ZHAW in Winterthur therefore offers a corresponding range of - teaching units in their own skills rooms. Project goal: By getting to know the midwife and her work, children learn that pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period are primarily healthy and natural processes that are handled by the midwife.Methods: The didactic design of the lessons is based on principles of skill-based and age-appropriate teaching such as storyline method, mini-simulations and exploratory learning which are accompanied by realistic and age-appropriate in-house simulation models.Implementation: Within the framework of a pilot project, three teaching lessons are offered to schoolchildren between  to  years of age from the canton of Zurich covering the topics of pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Involved in the project are sixth semester midwifery students from ZHAW who teach selected sequences. The schoolchildren, both girls and boys, who participated in the pilot project showed great interest in the subject. They vigorously participated in conversations about their own birth, contributed to the workshop discussion entitled \"From Conception to Birth\" and became involved in the mini-simulation \"The Birth of a Baby\".Evaluation: All teaching units were evaluated in a multi-step process. Primary class teachers described the lessons as level-appropriate, varied and well-balanced. One of them said: \"It was obvious to me from the beginning that the issue was about natural life cycle processes. I would attend the course again and can absolutely recommend it.\" The midwifery students were proud when they realised how much knowledge they have acquired during their studies and were able to pass on. From the schoolchildren's interest in the course and their questions, the teaching staff concluded that the topics covered during the lessons have a lasting impact on a further discussion of these subjects.Outlook: It is intended to officially include these teaching units in the BSc in Midwifery course syllabus. This also means that sixth semester midwifery students will be playing an active role in the teaching of schoolchildren.","doc_id":552,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2701","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Towards development of a label for zero emission buildings : a tool to evaluate potential zero emission buildings","authors":"Bühler, Devi; Schuetze, Thorsten; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Zero emission buildings; Sustainable technologies;  Architektur","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"720","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Towards development of a label for zero emission buildings : a tool to evaluate potential zero emission buildings; Zero emission buildings; Sustainable technologies;  Architektur; The operation of so-called Zero Emission Buildings (ZEB) does not result in harmful emissions to water, soil and air.

Improvements made in the biological treatment, to support the removal of organic pollutants, were monitored. The organic matter was removed up to .% for COD and over % for BOD, but showed still too high values for save reuse. Nutrients, such as, NH-N, PO-P were found to be preserved during the treatment. During the observation period, the IWB did not achieve the expected treatment performance. It was assumed that the biology was inhibited by some unknown substances in the wastewater. Observations indicated shock loads with detergents and hydraulic short-circuits. The IWB was screened on two days for estrogenic active substances using the planar-YES bioassay. Estrone (E) andβ-Estradiol (E) were found in concentrations of up to . ng/l for E and . ng/l for E. The oral contraceptive -Ethinylestradiol (EE) was only measured in the aerobic part of the IWB in the first screening, and in low concentrations. In total six unknown substances were detected, where one of them most likely seemed to be Bisphenol A. To assess the potential role of biochar and activated biochar for MP elimination in wastewater, a biochar (BC) from cherry stones and three different activated biochars (ABC) from KCO impregnated cherry stones, with different impregnation ratios, were produced. The pyrolysis was performed using the Pyreka pyrolysis reactor at  °C and a holding time of  min. Methylene blue (MB) adsorption experiments were performed with this chars and compared with a regular activated carbon. The BC showed the least adsorption of MB in all experiments.

From the supplier side, particularly, the integration of renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar) into the grid imposes an engineering and economic challenge because of the limited ability to control and dispatch these energy sources due to their intermittent characteristics. Time-series prediction of wind speed for wind power production is a particularly important and challenging task, wherein prediction intervals (PIs) are preferable results of the prediction, rather than point estimates, because they provide information on the confidence in the prediction. In this paper, two different machine learning approaches to assess PIs of time-series predictions are considered and compared: ) multilayer perceptron neural networks trained with a multiobjective genetic algorithm and ) extreme learning machines combined with the nearest neighbors approach.

Solarstrom gilt als umweltfreundlich, da während des Betriebs der Anlagen kaum Schadstoffemissionen anfallen. Ökobilanzen sind ein Instrument, um den Ressourcenverbrauch und die Emissionen nicht nur im Betrieb, sondern entlang des ganzen Lebenswegs von Produkten zu quantifizieren und zu bewerten.

Der Lebenszyklus der Solarstromproduktion umfasst dabei sowohl die Herstellung der Anlagenkomponenten als auch den Transport, die Montage, den Betrieb und die Entsorgung der Anlagen.Mit Planungssoftware der verschiedenen Hersteller oder deren Planungsabteilungen wurden Materiallisten der einzelnen Unterkonstruktionen erstellt. In einem ersten Schritt wurden die Umweltauswirkungen der Systeme direkt miteinander verglichen. Für den Vergleich von Strom ab den verschiedenen Anlagen wurden mit Hilfe von einem geografischen Informationssystem für Photovoltaik (PVGIS) die Ertragsberechnungen durchgeführt sowie aus der Zollhandelsstatistik die nötigen Daten zu Transport und Herkunft von Modulen und Laminaten abgerufen.Die Treibhausgasemissionen der bilanzierten Anlagen liegen zwischen . und . g CO-eq. pro kWh Strom.

The related control law is designed by using an eigenstructure assignment method. The controller thus obtained is verified through extensive numerical simulations on a time varying aeroservoelastic model excited by widely varying levels of turbulence. The control system is required to adapt both to slow variations of the system operational parameters, e.g. fuel consumption, slow acceleration manoeuvres; and to fast changes, e.g. store release, violent accelerations. The capability to maintain system stability after an actuator malfunction is also verified. The results demonstrate that the extended Kalman filter is superior to the least squares method in identifying the system. However the overall performances of the adaptive controller are quite insensitive to the identification results, so that the lower computational resources and cost required for the implementation of the least squares identifier makes it a better candidate for a practical realisation.","doc_id":876,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15891","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Reducing single-use waste : determinant factors for the use of reusable dishes on a university campus","authors":"Gosteli, Flavia; Hartmann, Cathérine; Reijnen, Ester; Hackenfort, Markus","subject":"Oro-environmental behaviour; Norm activation; Theory of planned behaviour; Packaging waste; Sustainable consumption; University campus;  Psychologie;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"150, 363","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Reducing single-use waste : determinant factors for the use of reusable dishes on a university campus; Oro-environmental behaviour; Norm activation; Theory of planned behaviour; Packaging waste; Sustainable consumption; University campus;  Psychologie;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","doc_id":901,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18114","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The environmental impact of hospitals","authors":"Keller, Regula; Stucki, Matthias; Muir, Karen","subject":"Health; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Environmental impact;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927, 362.11","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"The environmental impact of hospitals; Health; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Environmental impact;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen; SESSION: Sustainable Health Management – Performance of Health Services; Goal: Which aspects of a hospital are relevant from an environmental point of view?

The project “Green Hospital” aims to identify the environmentally relevant processes in hospitals as well as to suggest practical improvement options that at the same time increase the efficiency of the underlying processes. Although healthcare was determined to be the consumer sector with the fourth largest environmental impact, most research focuses on the three largest sectors: nutrition, mobility, and housing. Our research aim to fill the gap.Methods: A preliminary LCA was carried out using rudimentary data obtained by questionnaire from several hospitals in Switzerland. The results of this analysis were combined with the results of an improvement potential analysis carried out by project partners from the Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and Logistics to determine which environmentally relevant processes also have significant improvement potential. Detailed questionnaires were then sent to two partner hospitals to collect data in these specific areas. A second, more detailed LCA is currently being carried out to quantify the environmental impact of hospitals.Results: Catering, heat production and electricity were found to be the most environmentally relevant in our preliminary LCA. The five areas identified in our this analysis were: catering, energy provision, transport and mobility, waste treatment, and medicine, medical products, laundering, housekeeping and office supplies. For these chosen areas, specific data was collected to allow a broader scope for the second analysis.

The aim of the work is to measure the spectral sensitivity of tandem modules within the current/voltage scan. A standard industrial flasher was used to measure amorphous / microcrystalline (a- Si/uc-Si) tandem modules. This system was equipped with a special developed dynamic LED backlight at ZHAW. Test samples were analyzed using different shapes of dynamic backlight superposing the standard flasher STC spectra. The change of the LED backlight in the millisecond regime according to triangular, rectangular and sinusoidal shapes were applied. The analyzes were manly performed on a-Si/uc-Si tandem modules (.m x .m). A triangle backlight characteristic was applied, increasing the IR LED light from % to % of ISC of the crystalline Silicon reference cell. Immediately after that period of .ms, the IR LEDs are turned off and the blue LED decay from again % of ISC to % remaining on top of the STC spectra. This analysis shows significantly different spectral sensitivity at this specific time of changing from IR to blue. On the one hand the current of the module at maximum power point (MPP) changes proportionally with the IR intensity increase. On the other hand the tandem module’s short circuit current shows no significant changes at the same IR intensity variation. The same method of analyzes are applied to a-Si/uc-Si tandem modules operating during  months and  months respectively, under real outdoor conditions. It is evident that this outdoor degraded modules show only marginal changes of the module current at MPP for the same increase of this dynamic IR LED backlight. Thus, a method together with the setup is presented and confirmed to measure the state of degradation of this kind of tandem module during the flasher period of a few milliseconds. The use of the presented dynamic LED backlight has the potential, in the industrial module production process, to improve the output of a standard STC flash during several milliseconds by providing information about the current matching of top and bottom tandem cells on a module scale.","doc_id":1013,"prior":"production process","sdg12":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1874","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"Bergsteigen in Nepal - eine Ökobilanz","authors":"Kappeler, Christina","subject":"Ökobilanz; Bergsteigen; Nepal; Nachhaltiger Tourismus;  Freizeit und Tourismus;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"306.48, 333.7","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Bergsteigen in Nepal - eine Ökobilanz; Ökobilanz; Bergsteigen; Nepal; Nachhaltiger Tourismus;  Freizeit und Tourismus;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; In dieser Masterarbeit werden die Umweltauswirkungen des Bergsteigens in Nepal, anhand des Beispiels einer Besteigung des Mount Everest untersucht. Es wurde eine Ökobilanz für zwei Szenarien erstellt: Eine Besteigung im Expeditionsstil einer kommerziellen Gruppe und eine Besteigung im Alpinstil einer individuell organisierten Zweierseilschaft. Die funktionelle Einheit ist eine Besteigung des Mount Everest einer Person vom Zeitpunkt des Abfluges vom Flughafen Zürich bis zur Rückkehr. Die Reise wird in vier Phasen eingeteilt: Anreise, Akklimatisation, Bergsteigen und Rückreise.Ziel der Arbeit ist es, die Umweltauswirkungen einer Besteigung des Mount Everest zu untersuchen und die wichtigsten Einflussfaktoren zu identifizieren. Vertiefend liegt der Fokus zum einen auf der Frage, ob es einen Unterschied macht welche Art von Tourismus stattfindet und zum anderen ist das Zurückgelassene, in Form von Littering, von besonderem Interesse.Eine Besteigung des Mount Everest verursacht durchschnittlich  kg CO-eq. und  kPt Umweltbelastungspunkte (UBP). Die Ökobilanz zeigt, dass der Flug den grössten Teil der Umweltauswirkungen ausmacht, allerdings kann dieser meist nicht ersetzt werden. Bei der Wahl der Transportmittel vor Ort, den Entscheidungen bezüglich Ernährung und der Dauer des Einsatzes von Bekleidung und Material besteht Entscheidungsspielraum, um die Umweltauswirkungen zu beeinflussen.Der grösste Unterschied zwischen den beiden Szenarien besteht in der Unterstützung durch Sherpas und Bergführer. Dadurch sind die berechneten Umweltauswirkungen im Szenario Expedition ( kPt UBP) um etwa  Prozent grösser, als die des Szenarios Alpin ( kPt UBP). Wird die Summe der Bergsteiger betrachtet, gewinnt der Stil an Wichtigkeit. Das Bergsteigen mit einer kommerziellen Gruppe im Expeditionsstil ist für mehr Personen möglich, als das selbstständige Bergsteigen im Alpinstil, da es weniger Vorkenntnisse benötigt. Die Masse, die einen Gipfelversuch mit der angebotenen Unterstützung wagt, führt zu einer Überlastung des Berges. Eine Limitierung der Anzahl, würde die Umweltauswirkungen anteilsmässig verringern, respektive auf andere Ziele verlagern. Eine konzentrierte Nutzung ist zu bevorzugen, nicht aber eine Übernutzung. Das Verhalten des einzelnen Bergsteigers am Berg, kann von der persönlichen Einstellung, der Bildung und dem Hintergrund abhängen. Die Meinungen, ob Bergsteiger im Alpin oder Expeditionsstil mehr Abfall liegen lassen, gehen auseinander. In der Phase des Bergsteigens im Alpinstil, macht das Littering . Prozent (. kPt UBP) aus. Dies scheint nicht wesentlich zu sein, das Littering ist jedoch trotz des tiefen Resultats ein wichtiger Aspekt. Eine Verbesserung des Abfallmanagements vor Ort und das Vermeiden von Littering würden die Umweltauswirkungen reduzieren.Die Arbeit zeigt zwei Lücken auf: Die Aktivitäten im Tourismus wurden bisher, bezüglich Umweltauswirkungen, wenig untersucht. Obwohl die An-/ und Rückreise einen grossen Teil ausmachen, sind sie gegeben. Die Aktivitäten hingegen sind oftmals variabel und es besteht Potential zur Verringerung der Umweltauswirkungen des Tourismus. Die Bewertung des Litterings in der Ökobilanz ist ein offenes Thema. Es sollte ein einheitlicher Weg gefunden werden, um die Folgen abbilden zu können.Für Nepal ist der Tourismus eine wichtige Einnahmequelle. Nepal entwickelt sich als Land und dadurch entstehen neue Umweltherausforderungen. Die Touristen belasten das Ökosystem des Landes zusätzlich. Der Mount Everest ist ein einmaliges Ziel, das nicht ersetzt werden kann. Wer umweltverträglich bergsteigen will, achtet auf: die Nähe des Gipfelziels, Mass bezüglich der Anzahl Bergsteiger an einem Ort und persönliche Achtsamkeit bei Kauf- und Konsumentscheiden.","doc_id":1014,"prior":"Nachhaltiger Tourismus","sdg12":1},{"id":"93","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11897","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Motivated by Red Bull? : How international sponsorship influence the sport spectating consumption motivation","authors":"Ankeshian, Ara","subject":" Kultur;  Werbung und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"306, 659","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Motivated by Red Bull? : How international sponsorship influence the sport spectating consumption motivation;  Kultur;  Werbung und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit; Sponsorship is key to powerful marketing by increasing brand awareness and creating impactful brand associations. This is why companies from many industries turn to sports, with the objective of providing unique and memorable brand experiences to its customers. Sponsorships in this field are particularly well-suited to establish and evoke positive emotions among consumers. The popularity of this marketing tool can also be seen when taking a financial perspective. In the past decade, investments in sponsorships have steadily increased on a yearly basis, and this trend is expected to further grow in the future. In this study, it is of particular interest to assess if a sponsoring brand influences consumers’ motivation of sport spectator consumption. Based on an extensive literature review, a conceptual model was designed, which graphically shows the variables to be examined and their hypothesized interrelations. The questions therein served to measure each variable of the conceptual model. Next to the motivation, the brand-related variables of interest were the attitude toward the sponsoring brand, the event-sponsor fit, and the perceived sincerity. The sport and the brands were defined based on a pre-study.","doc_id":1015,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21485","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Sharing economy : a bibliometric analysis of the state of research","authors":"Filser, Matthias; Tiberius, Victor; Kraus, Sascha; Spitzer, Jonathan; Kailer, Norbert; Bouncken, Ricarda B.","subject":"Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Collaborative consumption; Disruption; Regulation; Business model; Literature review; Sharing economy;  Wirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"330","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Sharing economy : a bibliometric analysis of the state of research; Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Collaborative consumption; Disruption; Regulation; Business model; Literature review; Sharing economy;  Wirtschaft; The sharing economy has received increased attention in entrepreneurship research, resulting in a complex research landscape that is hard to overlook.

The aim was to analyse existing possibilities for overnight stays and to connect them together with new multi-day routes. The developed checklist was used as part of a situative analysis and attempts to demonstrate the effort being made by the various lodgings to create sustainable tourism. The topic was chosen because of a collaboration between the «Tourism and Sustainable Development research group» of the ZHAW and the local «Casa de Turismo» tourism office. The sustainability checklist was developed based on a literature research project. The creation of the new tourism product, the adaptation of the checklist and the survey were all accomplished as part of an on site fieldwork project.; Diese Bachelorarbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Erarbeitung und Anwendung einer Nachhaltigkeitscheckliste sowie dem Konstruieren eines neuen touristischen Angebots im Umland von Sucre, Bolivien.

Die erarbeitete Nachhaltigkeitscheckliste wurde als Teil der Ist-Analyse verwendet und sollte die Anstrengungen der Fincas in Richtung nachhaltigen Tourismus aufzeigen. Diese Arbeit wurde aufgegriffen, da die Forschungsgruppe «Tourismus und nachhaltige Entwicklung» der ZHAW in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Tourismusbüro «Casa de Turismo» vor Ort steht. So wurde über den Mangel an Erfolg der Fincas und das bevorstehende Projekt Kenntnis erhalten. Die Nachhaltigkeitscheckliste basiert auf einer Literaturrecherche.

So far, most ATS systems were operated in water bodies with relatively high nutrient concentrations. Little is known about the performance of ATS under low concentration of phosphorous (P), yet there are potential applications where such conditions are met. The paper presents a series of experiments that focus on the implementation of small-scale ATS systems to eliminate P from natural swimming ponds (SP). SPs are typically subject to fluctuating P concentrations and require the maintenance of very low levels of P (<  μg L-) in order to prevent undesirable algal growth. ATS systems proved to be capable of maintaining such low levels, both in laboratory and field conditions.","doc_id":1234,"prior":"water treatment","sdg12":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2160","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Possibilities and limits of wastewater-fed aquacultures","authors":"Junge-Berberović, Ranka","subject":"Wastewater-fed aquaculture;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"630","year":"2001","for_data_analysis":"Possibilities and limits of wastewater-fed aquacultures; Wastewater-fed aquaculture;  Landwirtschaft; Wastewater-fed aquaculture offers means to treat wastewater with integrated material-flow recycling.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools and workflow processes are considered key enablers for collaboratively managing such information across phases of the project lifecycle. With the increased adoption of BIM by the construction industry, there are heightened expectations for improved engagement of facility managers (FMs), users and clients in the BIM process. This is based on the proposition that BIM can benefit the operational phase of a building, which contributes the most to the building lifecycle in terms of overall cost, sustainability and usability.Three research questions were investigated: (a) How clients and FMs engagement with the BIM workflow process can be improved through the early contemplation of their requirements; (b) what are the perceptions about BIM and its potential impact on the FM industry from an FM, user and client perspective and (c) what data/information is required by FMs from the BIM workflow process to maximum optimisation of assets in the operation phase.Mixed research methods, including: a literature review of academic and industry publications (e.g. case studies, industry best practice, standards and guidelines), an online survey of FM professionals and focus groups, were used to address the posed research questions.   The findings highlight the need for further education regarding BIM guidelines and standards. In particular, new and more FM/client-focussed BIM strategy documents and templates compared to those currently available are required. Many existing templates (e.g. EIR) are not structured to adequately capture clients’ operational and information needs. Guidance is required on developing BIM strategies which start with clients Organisational Information Requirements (OIR) and Asset Information Requirements (AIR) and guide FMs to prepare an EIR that specifies what, when and how information should be delivered. This will improve timely decision making during design and ensure the right and correctly structured information is delivered in to clients at handover for their Asset Information Model (AIM) to help optimise the operation of their assets. A comprehensive description of the results obtained for each of the three research questions is included in this paper.  ","doc_id":1337,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"66","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11559","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Monetization of infrastructures and services","authors":"Skoviera, Martin; Harsh, Piyush; Serhiienko, Oleksii; Perez Belmonte, Manuel; Bohnert, Thomas Michael","subject":" Informatik;  Weltwirtschaft und Handel","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004, 337","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Monetization of infrastructures and services;  Informatik;  Weltwirtschaft und Handel; The objective of this paper is to illustrate how to monetize infrastructures and services.

Looking at the rising greenhouse gas emissions, the accelerating resource depletion or the vast pollution of our biosphere, it is clear that past efforts to reduce the ever growing impact form human activity in the form of efficiency strategies or green growth have failed completely. New, and more drastic measures are needed that go beyond contemporary efforts. Sufficiency strategies that aim at reducing the overall environmental impact by limiting per capita and total consumption are the only viable strategies (besides limiting or reducing world population) to avoid the inauspicious future outlook presented by climate scientists at this point. An open, pragmatic, and constructive public dialogue including all members of the public is important and necessary, to elaborate new strategies for our society, and as starting Point for a bigger transformation.; Der Zustand dieses Planeten ist sehr besorgniserregend.

Moreover, little is known about how customers can be motivated to adopt innovations that promote collective benefits. This research investigates the effectiveness of the two most basic elements of incentive-based policies — reward and punishment — with regard to customer participation in the sustainable energy domain. We counter the prevailing assumptions in innovation and technology research that favor the use of reward rather than punishment to engage customers. Based on a series of experimental studies, we find mixed evidence. It appears that punishment is at least as effective as reward in engaging customers in sustainable technology innovations. Even more importantly, both reward and punishment are shown to overcome concerns relating to technology. Moderated mediation reveals that economic incentives and disincentives ameliorate critical obstacles because customers more strongly favor their own personal benefit over the collective benefit and are more willing for ‘self-serving’ reasons to adopt technology that contributes to collective benefits. The findings of this research thus have novel practical and theoretical implications for energy innovation involving customers.","doc_id":1508,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6600","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Ausgaben für Produktionsmittel : Studie des Bauernverbands","authors":"Hilber, Urs","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"630","year":"1996","for_data_analysis":"Ausgaben für Produktionsmittel : Studie des Bauernverbands;  Landwirtschaft","doc_id":1575,"prior":"Produktionsmittel","sdg12":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23847","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Smart food waste management : embedded machine learning vs cloud based solutions","authors":"Zingg, Raphael; Andermatt, Philipp; Mazloumian, Amin; Rosenthal, Matthias","subject":"Food waste; IoT; Embedded machine learning; TensorRT; Embedded inference;  Spezielle Computerverfahren","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"006","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Smart food waste management : embedded machine learning vs cloud based solutions; Food waste; IoT; Embedded machine learning; TensorRT; Embedded inference;  Spezielle Computerverfahren; In Switzerland, . million tons of food are lost or wasted across all stages of food production - every year.

Aufbauend auf einer Literaturrecherche zu den Kompostierprozessen und den Eigenschaften ihrer Endprodukte wurde ein qualitativer Kompostierversuch durchgeführt: Vier Vermikompostiersysteme mit Eisenia fetida wurden während  Tagen von Juli bis November auf dem Feld des solidarischen Gemüsebaubetriebs «Wädichörbli» in Samstagern (CH) mit Grüngut (Beikraut und Rüstabfälle) gefüttert. Die Qualität des Vermikomposts, der Flächenbedarf, der Arbeitsaufwand sowie die Initial- und Unterhaltskosten wurden mit dem Feldrandkompost (FrK) des Betriebs verglichen. Die vier Systeme waren: Sch_H (beschattet, Fütterung mit gehäckseltem Grüngut), Sch_N (beschattet, Fütterung mit nicht zerkleinertem Grüngut), So_H (besonnt, Fütterung mit gehäckseltem Grüngut) und So_N (besonnt, Fütterung mit nicht zerkleinertem Grüngut). Untersucht wurde, ob sich mit der Vermikompostierung ein qualitativ hochwertigeres Endprodukt als mit dem FrK erzielen lässt und ob eine Beschattung der Wurmkiste und / oder das vorgängige Häckseln des Grünguts notwendig sind, um diesen Mehrwert zu generieren. Die Temperaturen in den Wurmkisten wurden aufgezeichnet und die Wurmpopulation bei der Probenahme erhoben. Die Komposte wurden im Labor analysiert und den Qualitätsrichtlinien der Branche für Kompost und Gärgut (BKG) sowie den Referenzwerten für Kompost aus der Publikation «Grundlagen für die Düngung landwirtschaftlicher Kulturen in der Schweiz» (GRUD) gegenübergestellt. Mittels offenem und geschlossenem Kressetest wurde die Phytotoxizität gemessen. Die Inaktivierung von Beikrautsamen wurde in einem Keimtest untersucht. Flächenbedarf, Arbeitsaufwand sowie Initial- und Unterhaltskosten wurden pro Hektar Gemüseanbaufläche berechnet.Die besonnten Varianten So_H und So_N führten zu keinem Mehrwert gegenüber dem FrK. Die beschatteten Varianten führten zu einer höheren Kompostqualität bezüglich Makronährstoffgehalte und -verfügbarkeit und wiesen eine signifikant bessere Inaktivierung der Beikrautsamen auf, waren aber phytotoxischer als der FrK. Der Flächenbedarf war bei allen Vermikomposten tiefer als beim FrK. Arbeitsaufwand sowie Initial- und Unterhaltskosten waren überall höher, konnten aber mit vorgängigem Häckseln des Grünguts gesenkt werden. Variante Sch_H produzierte den hochwertigsten und langfristig kostengünstigsten Vermikompost. Für diese Variante wurden ein Mehraufwand von  Arbeitsstunden jährlich und Initialkosten von  CHF berechnet. Aufgrund fehlender Wiederholungen können keine verallgemeinernden Aussagen gemacht und die Eignung der Vermikompostierung für solidarische Gemüsebaubetriebe nicht abschliessend beurteilt werden.; The present study investigated whether vermicomposting could be a useful alternative to field edge composting on Community-supported vegetable farms. Based on a literature research on composting processes and the properties of the end products, a qualitative composting trial was carried out: Four vermicomposting-systems with Eisenia fetida were set up on the fields of the «Wädichörbli» Community-supported vegetable farm in Samstagern (CH) and fed with green waste (weeds and vegetable waste) during  days from July to November. The quality of the resulting vermicomposts, the area required, the labour input and the costs were compared with the farm's field edge compost (FrK). The four vermicompost systems were: Sch_H (shaded, fed with shredded green waste), Sch_N (shaded, fed with unshredded green waste), So_H (sunny, fed with shredded green waste) and So_N (sunny, fed with unshredded green waste). It was investigated whether a higher quality end product could be achieved with vermicomposting than with FrK and whether shading of the worm bin and / or prior shredding of the green waste is necessary to generate this added value. The temperatures in the worm bins were recorded and the worm populations were determined after  days. The vermicomposts were analysed in the laboratory and compared with the quality requirements of the “Branche für Kompost und Gärgut” (BKG) and the reference values for compost in the publication \"Grundlagen für die Düngung landwirtschaftlicher Kulturen in der Schweiz\" (GRUD). The phytotoxicity was investigated by means of open and closed cress tests and the inactivation of weed seeds by means of a germination test. Area requirement, additional labour input as well as additional initial and maintenance costs were calculated per hectare of vegetable cultivation aria.The sunny variants So_H and So_N did not lead to any added value compared to FrK. The shaded variants led to a higher compost quality in terms of macronutrient content and availability as well as a significantly better inactivation of weed seeds, but were more phytotoxic than FrK. The area requirement for all vermicomposts was calculated lower than that of FrK.

Aufbauend auf einer Literaturrecherche zu den Kompostierprozessen und den Eigenschaften ihrer Endprodukte wurde ein qualitativer Kompostierversuch durchgeführt: Vier Vermikompostiersysteme mit Eisenia fetida wurden während  Tagen von Juli bis November auf dem Feld des solidarischen Gemüsebaubetriebs «Wädichörbli» in Samstagern (CH) mit Grüngut (Beikraut und Rüstabfälle) gefüttert. Die Qualität des Vermikomposts, der Flächenbedarf, der Arbeitsaufwand sowie die Initial- und Unterhaltskosten wurden mit dem Feldrandkompost (FrK) des Betriebs verglichen. Die vier Systeme waren: Sch_H (beschattet, Fütterung mit gehäckseltem Grüngut), Sch_N (beschattet, Fütterung mit nicht zerkleinertem Grüngut), So_H (besonnt, Fütterung mit gehäckseltem Grüngut) und So_N (besonnt, Fütterung mit nicht zerkleinertem Grüngut). Untersucht wurde, ob sich mit der Vermikompostierung ein qualitativ hochwertigeres Endprodukt als mit dem FrK erzielen lässt und ob eine Beschattung der Wurmkiste und / oder das vorgängige Häckseln des Grünguts notwendig sind, um diesen Mehrwert zu generieren. Die Temperaturen in den Wurmkisten wurden aufgezeichnet und die Wurmpopulation bei der Probenahme erhoben. Die Komposte wurden im Labor analysiert und den Qualitätsrichtlinien der Branche für Kompost und Gärgut (BKG) sowie den Referenzwerten für Kompost aus der Publikation «Grundlagen für die Düngung landwirtschaftlicher Kulturen in der Schweiz» (GRUD) gegenübergestellt. Mittels offenem und geschlossenem Kressetest wurde die Phytotoxizität gemessen. Die Inaktivierung von Beikrautsamen wurde in einem Keimtest untersucht. Flächenbedarf, Arbeitsaufwand sowie Initial- und Unterhaltskosten wurden pro Hektar Gemüseanbaufläche berechnet.Die besonnten Varianten So_H und So_N führten zu keinem Mehrwert gegenüber dem FrK. Die beschatteten Varianten führten zu einer höheren Kompostqualität bezüglich Makronährstoffgehalte und -verfügbarkeit und wiesen eine signifikant bessere Inaktivierung der Beikrautsamen auf, waren aber phytotoxischer als der FrK. Der Flächenbedarf war bei allen Vermikomposten tiefer als beim FrK. Arbeitsaufwand sowie Initial- und Unterhaltskosten waren überall höher, konnten aber mit vorgängigem Häckseln des Grünguts gesenkt werden. Variante Sch_H produzierte den hochwertigsten und langfristig kostengünstigsten Vermikompost. Für diese Variante wurden ein Mehraufwand von  Arbeitsstunden jährlich und Initialkosten von  CHF berechnet.

Based on a literature research on composting processes and the properties of the end products, a qualitative composting trial was carried out: Four vermicomposting-systems with Eisenia fetida were set up on the fields of the «Wädichörbli» Community-supported vegetable farm in Samstagern (CH) and fed with green waste (weeds and vegetable waste) during  days from July to November. The quality of the resulting vermicomposts, the area required, the labour input and the costs were compared with the farm's field edge compost (FrK). The four vermicompost systems were: Sch_H (shaded, fed with shredded green waste), Sch_N (shaded, fed with unshredded green waste), So_H (sunny, fed with shredded green waste) and So_N (sunny, fed with unshredded green waste). It was investigated whether a higher quality end product could be achieved with vermicomposting than with FrK and whether shading of the worm bin and / or prior shredding of the green waste is necessary to generate this added value. The temperatures in the worm bins were recorded and the worm populations were determined after  days. The vermicomposts were analysed in the laboratory and compared with the quality requirements of the “Branche für Kompost und Gärgut” (BKG) and the reference values for compost in the publication \"Grundlagen für die Düngung landwirtschaftlicher Kulturen in der Schweiz\" (GRUD). The phytotoxicity was investigated by means of open and closed cress tests and the inactivation of weed seeds by means of a germination test. Area requirement, additional labour input as well as additional initial and maintenance costs were calculated per hectare of vegetable cultivation aria.The sunny variants So_H and So_N did not lead to any added value compared to FrK. The shaded variants led to a higher compost quality in terms of macronutrient content and availability as well as a significantly better inactivation of weed seeds, but were more phytotoxic than FrK. The area requirement for all vermicomposts was calculated lower than that of FrK. Labour input as well as initial and maintenance costs were higher in all four vermicomposting systems, but could be reduced by shredding the green waste beforehand. Variant Sch_H produced the highest quality and most cost-effective vermicompost in the long term, requiring an initial investment of  CHF and  additional working hours per year compared to FrK. Due to a lack of replication, no generalised statements can be made and the suitability of vermicomposting for Community Vegetable Farms cannot be assessed conclusively.","doc_id":1796,"prior":"compost","sdg12":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20686","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"How to collect current usage data outside the laboratory","authors":"Baumann, Patrick; Heinzelmann, Andreas","subject":"Energiemessung; NILM; Stromdatenanalyse;  Energie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333.79","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"How to collect current usage data outside the laboratory; Energiemessung; NILM; Stromdatenanalyse;  Energie; Everybody is talking about saving energy. Since it’s always a good idea to reduce electrical power consumption as much as possible, it is not so easy to find the best way to do so.  Without knowing in detail, how current is used, it is only a rough guess which electrical device could be optimized. But not only the device is responsible for power usage also the user operating the device has a big impact.Although it is easy to collect (electrical) data in a laboratory, just use a power-meter, getting information out from and insight in a “real” environment is more complicated. The goal is to get a meter between the power grid and an existing household – right after the official electrical meter. It is always easy to develop a customized solution, but usually, it is the slowest and most expensive solution. The usage of standardized and already available equipment solves many problems (e.g. certification, robustness) and is much cheaper. On the downside, you must work with what you get – almost no tweaks are possible.Through my work, I was able to collect many experiences in the collection of huge amounts of raw electrical data mostly with a self-developed smart-meter. In short; a raspberry-Pi computer combined with a standard energy-consumption-meter. Collecting precise electrical data over periods from weeks to over a year with a resolution of one second from different swiss households and industrial plants resulted in a wide collection of raw data. Just to collect constantly the raw data is only the first step, a big part of the work is the cleaning and preparation of the database. For example, further development of the firmware during measurement changes the data output; It is mandatory to harmonize all the data for further analysis. After this step, it is possible to use the data for many purposes. Getting a detailed insight of the daily electrical usage is just the easiest one. How about detecting some patterns? Now it is possible to do research far beyond “just saving energy”.The collected data is predestined for data mining, either statistical or by advanced artificial intelligence algorithm. Different methods lead to different results - this is the actual state of work I’d like to present.","doc_id":1820,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5166","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Holistic system design approach for energy harvesting systems in real-world applications","authors":"Gruber, Juan-Mario","subject":"Boost Converter; TEG; Energy Harvesting; Design Approach;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"621.3","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Holistic system design approach for energy harvesting systems in real-world applications; Boost Converter; TEG; Energy Harvesting; Design Approach;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; Energy harvesting enables the realisation of innovative applications where the autarkic operation of microelectronics and embedded systems is attractive or necessary. Recent advances allow reaching power potential that makes such systems a viable alternative to using batteries. In particular the potential of maintenance-free operation, measured in years if not decades, makes this technology attractive for many applications.We show that standard engineering design processes are insufficient for the design of autarkic systems and present a holistic approach for a design process and apply it to two real-world applications. These applications are an autonomous condition monitoring system for industrial drives using an inductive harvester and a self-sufficient system powering a DC-Drive using a thermoelectric generator. The presentation shows that the application plays a key role in the design of an autarkic system. On the one hand it determines the use-case, the required functions and thus the expected energy consumption of the system. It simultaneously defines the constraints for the energy harvesting. The process therefore consists of an iterative design and modification of use-case, power generation and power consumption.Tests with prototypes demonstrate the suitability of the concepts for the two considered applications. Energy is continuously collected by the harvesters and provided by the energy aggregate at the right time. Powering an actuator requires particular care in the optimisation of the power management. The dynamic nature of actuator operation requires a strategy to ensure the necessary power level is available to complete actuator movement.","doc_id":1835,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10292","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Energieeffizienz des Brotbackprozesses : Teil 2","authors":"Buchli, Jürg; Aus der Au, Philipp; Kinner, Mathias; Kleinert, Michael","subject":"Brot; Backprozess; Energie;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"664","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Energieeffizienz des Brotbackprozesses : Teil ; Brot; Backprozess; Energie;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; The first part of this paper has been published in the preceding issue of cereal technology (cereal technol.

Dazu werden vier Forschungsfragen gestellt: Erstens, welche Bedürfnisse der Touristen, die wegen dem Whale Watching nach San Ignacio kommen, werden von den Camps gedeckt? Zweitens, wie wird das Angebot der Camps von den Touristen wahrgenommen? Da in der Lagune San Ignacio nur Ökotourismuscamps angeboten werden, wird eine dritte Forschungsfrage gestellt: Was beinhaltet die Tourismusform «Ökotourismus» in der Lagune von San Ignacio? Viertens, welches Potenzial hat Umweltbildung in der Lagune San Ignacio? Zu den Forschungsfragen wurden zudem drei Hypothesen aufgestellt.Das Ziel dieser Bachelorarbeit ist es, Empfehlungen für die Whale Watching- und Ökotourismuscamps in der Lagune San Ignacio zu erarbeiten, basierend auf einer Befragung der Touristen und einer Nachhaltigkeitsanalyse. Um eine Übersicht über die Ausstattung und das Angebot der sechs Camps zu erarbeiten, wurde für jedes Camp ein Steckbrief sowie eine zusammenfassende SWOT-Analyse zu den Camps erstellt. Um die Hypothesen zu testen und die Forschungsfragen zu beantworten, wurden eine quantitative Umfrage und qualitative Interviews mit den Whale Watching-Touristen der Lagune San Ignacio durchgeführt. Die Untersuchungsmethode richtete sich nach einem Mixed Methods-Ansatz. Die Ergebnisse der qualitativen und quantitativen Befragungen ergaben, dass die Gäste mit dem Angebot der Camps und der Menge an Informationen über die Grauwale und die Region sehr zufrieden waren. Die Verteilung der Antworten auf die unterschiedlichen Camps zeigte jedoch, dass bei zwei der sechs Camps mehr als die Hälfte der Touristen sich mehr Information zu den Grauwalen und der Region wünschen. Ausserdem kann festgehalten werden, dass sich die Mehrheit der Touristen spezifisch wegen dem Ökotourismus-Angebot und aufgrund von Empfehlungen für das Whale Watching in der Lagune San Ignacio entschieden haben. Zudem stellte das Anfassen der Grauwale, ein weiterer wichtiger Grund für die Reise in die Lagune dar. Die Hypothesen dieser Arbeit mussten allesamt verworfen werden. Die Forschungsfragen I bis III konnten erfolgreich beantwortet werden. Die vierte Forschungsfrage bleibt unbeantwortet, weil das Potenzial mit den gestellten Fragen aus dem Fragebogen nicht beantwortet werden konnten. Die quantitative Umfrage ergab, dass die Touristen mit dem Whale Watching, dem Personal und dem nachhaltigen Ambiente sehr zufrieden waren. Die qualitativen Interviews zeigten zudem, dass alle sechs Interviewpartner für das Whale Watching- und Ökotourismusangebot in die San Ignacio-Lagune zurückkehren würden oder bereits zurückgekehrt sind. Schlussfolgernd kann festgehalten werden, dass die Camps vorbildlich handeln, was die Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien und die Organisation des Whale Watching anbelangt.

The concept of Customer Equity (Rust, Zeithaml, Lemon, ) has given this idea a conceptual and methodological foundation. Marketing can then be seen as the attempt to maximize Customer Equity by corresponding activities. For doing this, we focus on the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and ways for its maximization.While the CLV has become a well-studied concept in marketing with a lot of literature coverage, much less work has been done in developing methods how to increase CLV. As an active increase in CLV always requires some activities, it is coupled with costs, and a cost-benefit analysis has to be made.We develop a new model for such a cost-benefit-analysis, by considering a customer as an investment object: A customer treatment incurs costs today, while, on the other hand, it generates returns in the future, over the lifecycle of the customer. Since a customer can receive different forms of treatment, there are in fact different investment options available. When trying to increase the CLV, these options have to be compared to each other.By formalizing this approach in a quantitative model, we create a framework for describing the cost-benefit profile of an individual customer. With this framework, optimum treatments can be identified, and the optimum height of investment into a single customer can be determined.","doc_id":2163,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21467","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Challenges and solutions for biogas production from agriculture waste in the Aral Sea basin","authors":"Saidmamatov, Olimjon; Rudenko, Inna; Baier, Urs; Khodjaniyazov, Elbek","subject":"Biogas; Agriculture; Aral Sea; Uzbekistan; Organic waste management; Digestate;  Energie;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.79, 630","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Challenges and solutions for biogas production from agriculture waste in the Aral Sea basin; Biogas; Agriculture; Aral Sea; Uzbekistan; Organic waste management; Digestate;  Energie;  Landwirtschaft; Energy plays an essential role in the modern society and can serve as one of the vital parameters of socio-economic development.

Our research is based on literature and document analysis and qualitative interviews.The results show that different implementation concepts require different measures. From the analysis of the results, the conclusions are that integrated energy planning is more important than ever. Understanding the different dimensions of sustainable development in combination with energy supply and consumption is important to plan and realise settlements that not only contribute significantly to reducing energy consumption and securing the location of energy infrastructure (generation, distribution, storage), but also in terms of long-term sustainable development and specifically climate neutrality.","doc_id":2276,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"50","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20774","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Ökobilanzierung von Rasensportfeldern : Natur-, Kunststoff- und Hybridrasen der Stadt Zürich im Vergleich","authors":"Itten, René; Glauser, Lukas; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Ökobilanz; LCA; Rasensportfelder; Sportrasen; Kunstrasen; Kunststoffrasen; Umweltauswirkung; Treibhausgasemission; Primärenergieverbrauch; Zürich;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333.7","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Ökobilanzierung von Rasensportfeldern : Natur-, Kunststoff- und Hybridrasen der Stadt Zürich im Vergleich; Ökobilanz; LCA; Rasensportfelder; Sportrasen; Kunstrasen; Kunststoffrasen; Umweltauswirkung; Treibhausgasemission; Primärenergieverbrauch; Zürich;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Fussball ist die beliebteste Team-Sportart der Schweiz. Für ein Fussballspiel braucht es nur Spieler, einen Ball und ein Rasensportfeld. Letzteres ist jedoch nicht einfach nur Rasen, sondern ein genau definiertes und konstruiertes Bauwerk, welches aus Natur-, Hybrid- oder Kunststoffrasen bestehen kann. Die Stadt Zürich will den Primärenergieverbrauch sowie die Treibhausgasemissionen pro Person reduzieren. Um die Umweltauswirkungen der verschiedenen Arten von Rasensportfeldern zu analysieren und zu vergleichen, beauftragte Grün Stadt Zürich die Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften mit einer Ökobilanz-Studie. In Zusammenarbeit mit den Rasensportfeld-Experten und -Expertinnen, die die Rasensportfelder in der Stadt Zürich bauen und unterhalten, wurden Primärdaten über den gesamten Lebenszyklus der Sportrasen gesammelt. Basierend auf diesen Daten wurden Sachbilanzen für je zwei verschiedene Naturrasen und Kunststoffrasen sowie einen Hybridrasen erstellt, die alle Lebenszyklusphasen abdecken. Die Ökobilanz umfasst eine Auswahl der vom Joint Research Council der Europäischen Kommission empfohlenen Indikatoren für den organisatorischen und produktbezogenen ökologischen Fussabdruck sowie die aggregierte Gesamtumweltbelastung nach Methode der ökologische Knappheit in Umweltbelastungspunkten und Human- und Ökotoxizität nach USEtox.Berücksichtigt werden die Umweltauswirkungen anhand der untersuchten Wirkungskategorien von der Produktion und dem Bau der Rasensportfelder über die Pflege und Renovation bis zum Rückbau und der Entsorgung. Nicht in diese Ökobilanz-Studie einbezogen werden indirekte Umweltauswirkungen, welche durch die Nutzer der Rasensportfelder entstehen, z.B. während der An- und Rückfahrt sowie durch die benötigte Sportkleidung oder Ernährung. Die Datengrundlage dieser Studie basiert auf Werten der Stadt Zürich. Die Resultate können daher nur bedingt auf andere geografische Regionen adaptiert werden. Bei theoretisch maximal möglicher Nutzungsdauer, die sich je nach Rasentyp unterscheidet, verursacht bei allen untersuchten Indikatoren ausser Treibhausgasemissionen und Primärenergiebedarf über den gesamten Lebenszyklus gesehen das unverfüllte Kunststoffrasensportfeld die tiefsten Umweltauswirkungen. Danach ist das Resultat unterschiedlich für die weiteren Rasensportfelder in Abhängigkeit der untersuchten Umweltauswirkungen.Die Erstellung von Naturrasensportfeldern, mit oder ohne Dränschicht, hat bei allen untersuchten Indikatoren die geringsten Umweltauswirkungen pro Quadratmeter. Der Bau von Hybrid- oder Kunststoffrasenspielfeldern (unverfüllt oder verfüllt) hat vergleichbar oder deutlich höhere Umweltauswirkungen für die unterschiedlichen Indikatoren, da grosse Mengen an synthetischen Materialien benötigt werden. Während des Betriebs sind die Umweltauswirkungen bei Natur- und Hybridrasen im Vergleich zu Kunststoffrasen deutlich höher, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Eutrophierung, da die Herstellung des erforderlichen Mineraldüngers energieintensiv ist und die Emissionen bei seiner Ausbringung eine stark eutrophierende Wirkung haben.Der wichtigste Faktor für die Umweltauswirkungen ist jedoch die jährliche Nutzungszeit. Kunststoff- und Hybridrasen können im Vergleich zu Naturrasen wesentlich länger bespielt werden pro Jahr. Bei optimaler Auslastung haben Kunststoffrasensportfelder deutlich geringere Umweltauswirkungen pro Nutzungsstunde.Die jährliche Nutzungszeit ist jedoch nicht nur abhängig vom Rasensportfeld, sondern auch von der vorhandenen Infrastruktur. So sind die jährlichen Nutzungsstunden von Rasensportfeldern ohne Beleuchtung deutlich einschränkt. Des Weiteren sind zusätzliche Faktoren ausschlaggebend für die Nutzungsintensität und die daraus resultierende Qualität der Rasensportfelder. Auffallend ist bspw., dass Rasensportfelder, die ausschliesslich für das Training verwendet werden, eher übernutzt werden, während Felder, die auch für Meisterschaftsspiele genutzt werden, zum Teil (deutlich) unter dem Maximum ausgelastet sind.","doc_id":2286,"prior":"Lebenszyklus","sdg12":1},{"id":"91","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1050","date":"2016","language":"de","title":"Implizite CO2-Preise des fossilen Energieverbrauchs in der Schweiz","authors":"Schleiniger, Reto","subject":"Schweizerische Energie- und Klimapolitik; Externe Kosten; Internalisierung; Implizite CO2-Preise;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Implizite CO-Preise des fossilen Energieverbrauchs in der Schweiz; Schweizerische Energie- und Klimapolitik; Externe Kosten; Internalisierung; Implizite CO-Preise;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Der Verbrauch von fossiler Energie verursacht sowohl lokale externe Kosten wie Luftverschmutzung als auch globale Probleme durch die Klimaveränderung.

The aim of this publication is to present the development of eco-factors for fish resources and by-catch as an addition to the Swiss Ecological Scarcity Method  and to compare the eco-factors of different fish resources and the impacts of fishing as well as the impacts of dietary alternatives like chicken, pork, lamb, beef and veal.Materials and Methods: The sustainable use of fish resources ensures that the fish stock for each fish species exceeds the minimum stock needed for a maximum sustainable yield.

In this paper, dokspot is presented, which is an internet-based service that aims at solving this problem by securely linking healthcare products with online instructions. The key to achieve this is a sophisticated security architecture and the focus of this paper is on the core components of this architecture. This includes a secure workflow to manage online instructions, which prevents, e.g., attacks by malicious insiders. Also, the traditionally monolithic web application architecture was split into role-based microservices, which provides protection even if parts of the system are compromised. Furthermore, digital signatures are utilized to continuously safeguard the lifecycle of online instructions to guarantee their genuineness and integrity. And finally, a passwordless signature scheme is introduced to hide inconvenient extra steps from the users while still maintaining security. Overall, this security architecture makes dokspot highly resistant to a wide range of attacks.","doc_id":2537,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21507","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Proposal of a methodology for the sustainability assessment of cryptocurrencies","authors":"Näf, Marco; Keller, Thomas; Seiler, Roger","subject":"Blockchain; Blockchain case and innovation; Cryptocurrency; Sustainability;  Finanzwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"332","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Proposal of a methodology for the sustainability assessment of cryptocurrencies; Blockchain; Blockchain case and innovation; Cryptocurrency; Sustainability;  Finanzwirtschaft; As cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more widespread and their power consumption has caught the attention of the public, it seems worthwhile to investigate their effects on the environment, economy and society.

Initially consumed by the aristocracy, coffee has developed since the early th century into one of the world’s most popular beverages and is now part of our daily routine and lifestyle. It also represents a major source of income for many coffee-producing countries and is a significant business sector in consumer countries. The triumph of this beverage may have been driven by various factors, but there is no doubt that its unique flavor is the prime reason for its amazing success. Here we will review current knowledge on the aroma of coffee from a chemical and analytical perspective and outline future trends. It is believed that most coffee aroma compounds have already been identified and quantified. Yet little is understood about how these aroma compounds are generated from green coffee precursors during roasting. A true definition of the aroma of freshly roasted and/or brewed coffee is very elusive and some aroma compounds start to degrade the moment they form. Furthermore, research on interindividual differences in the sensation and perception of coffee aromas is still in its infancy. After reviewing our current knowledge on coffee aroma compounds, we will outline recent developments in time-resolved analysis in three fields:. Aroma formation during roasting . Aroma extraction during espresso preparation and . In-mouth release during consumption.

Given their prominent position, esports have received extensive media and academic attention. In particular, esports fans, primarily tech-savvy and affluent young adults, have been the foci of this attention. Accordingly, a large number of studies has centered on these influential consumers, examining their motives to spectate, support, and follow esports teams and players. To date, esports have been examined very broadly, neglecting differences in the multitude of games, genres, and platforms which influence their consumption. In particular, the platform (or medium), plays a substantial role in how consumers engage with esports teams and players. These platforms include personal computers (PCs) and video gaming consoles. The purpose of this study is to identify differences in how fans of PC and console based esports teams engage with their favorite esports team. We collected data from both PC and console esports team fans via an online survey (N = ), analyzing said data using structural equation modeling and multigroup analysis. Our results highlight that fans of console-based esports teams value both emotional engagement and management cooperation, underscoring the more intimate and personal experience afforded by consoles (vis-à-vis PCs). Overall, our study elucidates differences in esports fan engagement and helps to further identify critical differences that influence esports consumer behavior.","doc_id":2814,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17967","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"How to promote the installation of photovoltaic systems","authors":"Sperr, Nadia; Rohrer, Jürg","subject":"Solar energy; Photovoltaic; Motivation & Barrier; Promotion;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Wohnbauten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"338.927, 621.3, 728","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"How to promote the installation of photovoltaic systems; Solar energy; Photovoltaic; Motivation & Barrier; Promotion;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Wohnbauten; The potential for solar energy production on existing buildings in Switzerland is estimated to be % of annual Swiss electricity consumption.

Homogeneity depends on different factors, including the stirrer type and the reactor type (e.g., ratio of diameter/height, ratio of impeller tip diameter/reactor diameter) with or without baffles. This study compares two impellers for enzymatic hydrolysis of suspensions of biomass particles on a milliliter scale. Both impellers were derived from industrially relevant geometries, such as blade and grid stirrers, although the geometry of the second stirrer was slightly modified to an asymmetric shape. The stirrers were investigated with different stirrer-reactor configurations. This was done experimentally and with the aid of computational fluid dynamics. The flow field, mixing numbers, power characteristics and initial conversion rates of sugars were considered to compare the two stirrers. The simulated mixing numbers and power characteristics in baffled and unbaffled milliliter-scale reactors were found to be in good agreement with the measured mixing times and power consumption. The mixing numbers required to reach homogeneity were much higher for the symmetric impeller and remained at least twice as high as the mixing numbers required when using the asymmetric impeller. The highest initial sugar releases from milled corn stover suspensions were achieved with the asymmetric impeller shape. Regardless of the differences in the flow fields or mixing times, diverging enzymatic sugar releases could be confirmed for Newtonian media only.","doc_id":2925,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"85","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11228","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"GreenCycle - ein Instrument für die nachhaltige Bewirtschaftung von Grünräumen aus der Schweiz","authors":"Brack, Florian; Buser, Hans; Semmler, Ralf","subject":"Grünräume;  Raumplanung (Städtebau)","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"711","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"GreenCycle - ein Instrument für die nachhaltige Bewirtschaftung von Grünräumen aus der Schweiz; Grünräume;  Raumplanung (Städtebau); GreenCycle ist ein neues Instrument für die Berechnung von Unterhaltungskosten für Grünräume.

Dabei übernehmen Bäume eine wichtige Rolle, um das Mikroklima durch Transpiration und Verschattung zu verbessern. Doch durch die extremen Standortfaktoren im Strassenraum, können viele einheimische Arten den gestellten Anforderungen nicht mehr gerecht werden. So steigt die Notwendigkeit, das Wissen über die Reaktionsmuster von Stadtbäumen auf Trockenstress sowie ihren Einfluss auf das Mikroklima zu erweitern. Das Ressourcenangebot des ursprünglichen Lebensraumes einer Spezies scheint dabei ihre Umwelttoleranz zu beeinflussen. Erste Studien zeigen, dass fremdländische im Vergleich zu mitteleuropäischen Arten sensibler auf Trockenheit reagieren und ihre Transpiration einschränken. Um Baumstandorte zu optimieren und damit die Ökosystemleistungen klassischer Baumarten zu steigern, wird im Theorieteil dieser Arbeit das Schwammstadtkonzept vorgestellt. Diese Arbeit hat das Ziel, anhand von Saftflussmessungen auf Stammebene und der Messung der Temperatur und Luftfeuchtigkeit auf drei Stammhöhen, die Kühlleistung und Trockenstressverträglichkeit von drei Baumarten an einem Strassenstandort der Stadt Zürich zu messen. Bei den Baumarten und Sorten handelt es sich um Gleditsia triacanthos `Skyline`, Ulmus `Rebona` und Salix alba `Liempde`. Insgesamt werden je drei Bäume einer Art untersucht. Dabei enthält die statistische Auswertung aufgrund von Vandalismus am Untersuchungsstandort keine Messergebnisse der Rebona-Ulme. Die Resultate zeigen, dass der Wasserverlust der Arten in engem Zusammenhang mit Klimafaktoren steht. Der Saftfluss steigt mit zunehmender Temperatur, während sinkende Temperaturen, eine höhere Luftfeuchtigkeit und Nieder-schlag die Raten reduzieren. Die Gleditschien und die Silberweiden weisen dabei trotz ihrer gemeinsamen Zuordnung zum Lebensbereich der Auengehölze, artspezifische Reaktionen auf Trockenheit auf. Während die Gleditschie eine hohe Sensitivität gegenüber atmosphärischer Trockenheit zeigt und den Wasserverbrauch stark reguliert, hält die Silberweide ihre stomatäre Leitfähigkeit auch unter trockenen Bedingungen aufrecht. So weist die Gleditschie trotz grösserer transpirierender Blattfläche eine geringere Saftflussrate als die Silberweide auf. Die Resultate lassen darauf schliessen, dass die Gleditschie als ringporige Art, dem isohydrischen Strategietyp und die Silberweide als Zerstreutporer den anisohydrischen Spezies zugeordnet werden kann. Ein Kühleffekt, der auf die Transpirationsmenge zurückzuführen wäre, ist aufgrund der jungen Bäume mit kleinen Kronen noch nicht möglich. Die nicht signifikanten Temperaturunterschiede können dennoch auf erste Beschattungseffekte der Bäume sowie geringeren Oberflächentemperatur der vegetativen Strukturen zurückgeführt werden. Die Eigenschaft, den eigenen Wasserverbrauch einschränken zu können, bewahrt die Gleditschie vor Vitalitätseinbussen, resultiert jedoch in geringeren Kühleffekten. Daher kann die Gleditschie für stark sonnenexponierte Standorte mit weniger Wasserverfügbarkeit empfohlen werden. Die Silberweide wird mit zunehmendem Alter einen hohen Kühleffekt aufweisen, was in verdichteten Stadtgebieten die Aufenthaltsqualität steigern kann. Sie sollte jedoch an Standorte mit genügend Zugang zur Bodenfeuchtigkeit gepflanzt werden, die darüber hinaus, nicht ganztägig voll besonnt sind.; In the face of climate change and global urbanization, trees becoming the central element of urban green spaces to reduce heating stress. They play an important role in improving the microclimate through transpiration and shading. However, due to the extreme site factors in the street places, many native species can no longer meet our requirements for city trees. Thus, there is a growing need to increase knowledge about the response patterns of urban trees to drought stress as well as their influence on the urban microclimate. The resource availability of the original habitat of a species seems to influence its environmental tolerance. First studies show that foreign species react more sensitively to drought compared to Central European species and limit their transpiration with limited resources. In order to optimize tree sites and thus increase the vitality and ecosystem services of classical tree species, the concept of Sponge City is presented in the theoretical part of this thesis. The present work aims to measure the cooling performance and drought stress tolerance of three tree species at a street site in the city of Zurich, using sap flow measurements at stem level and temperature and humidity measurements at different stem heights. The tree species are Gleditsia triacanthos 'Skyline', Ulmus 'Rebona' and Salix alba 'Liempde'. A total of three trees of each species are examined. Thereby, the statistical analysis does not include measurement results of Ulmus `Rebona` due to vandalism at the study site. The results show that the water loss of the species is closely related to climatic factors. Sap flow increases with increasing temperature, while decreasing temperatures, higher humidity and precipitation reduce the rates. In this regard, Gleditsia triacanthos and Salix alba despite their affiliation to the riparian trees, exhibit species-specific responses to drought and heat. While Gleditsia triacanthos shows a high sensitivity to atmospheric drought and strongly regulates water consumption, Salix alba maintains its stomatal conductance even under drying conditions. Thus, despite a larger transpiring leaf area Gleditsia triacanthos has a lower sap flow rate than Salix alba. The results suggest that Gleditsia triacanthos as a ring-porous species, can be assigned to the stress-avoiding, isohydric strategy type and the willows as diffuse-porous species to the stress-stolant, anisohydric species. A direct cooling effect, which would be due to the transpiration amount, is not yet possible due to the young trees with reduced sap flow and small crowns. Nevertheless, the non-significant temperature differences can be attributed to initial shading effects of the trees as well as the lower surface temperature of the vegetative structures. The ability to limit its own water consumption protects Gleditsia triacanthos from loss of vitality, but results in lower cooling effects. Therefore, Gleditsia triacanthos can be recommended for strongly sun-exposed sites with less water availability. Salix alba will have a high cooling effect as it ages, which may increase the quality of life in dense urban areas. However, this species should be planted in locations with sufficient access to soil moisture, which in addition, are not fully sunlit all day.","doc_id":3070,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"67","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23941","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"The coffee guide","authors":"Bozzola, Martina; Charles, Sarah; Ferretti, Tommaso; Gerakari, Eleni; Manson, Hernan; Rosser, Neil; von der Goltz, Philip","subject":"Coffee; Supply chain; Sustainability; Coffee market;  Produktion","type":"Buch","bid":"338","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The coffee guide; Coffee; Supply chain; Sustainability; Coffee market;  Produktion; The Coffee Guide is the world's most extensive, hands-on and neutral source of information on the international coffee trade.

Danach sollte im Sinne der effizienten Nutzung natürlicher Ressourcen das bestehende Potenzial genutzt werden, die Abgabe und das Spenden von Lebensmitteln gezielt auszuweiten, ohne dabei die Lebensmittelsicherheit zu gefährden.Dieser Bericht soll im Sinne eines Leitfadens Herstellern, Inverkehrbringern und Abnehmern von Lebensmitteln (z.B. sozialen Einrichtungen) eine Entscheidungsgrundlage liefern, um die Abgabe von Lebensmitteln im Sinne der Gewährleistung der Lebensmittelsicherheit sowie der Reduktion von Lebensmittelverlusten weiter zu optimieren. Der Bericht beinhaltet die relevanten rechtlichen Grundlagen und liefert konkrete Empfehlungen, um Lebensmittel in der Praxis so lange abzugeben und zu konsumieren, wie sie sicher und einwandfrei sind. Zudem sollen karitative Organisationen respektive deren Begünstigte vermehrt unterstützt werden können.Konkret ist es aufgrund der lebensmittelrechtlichen und haftungsrechtlichen Grundlagen erlaubt, Produkte mit einem Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum (MHD) nach Ablauf des MHDs weiterhin in Verkehr zu bringen, sofern das Prinzip der Selbstkontrolle eingehalten und die Informationspflicht wahrgenommen wird, damit es nicht zur Täuschung kommt. Dabei besteht kein Risiko für die Lebensmittelsicherheit, weil im Normalfall eine Qualitätsbeeinträchtigung von Produkten mit einem MHD eine gleichzeitige sensorischen Veränderung hervorruft. Konsumenten können also vor dem Verzehr mit den eigenen Sinnen sicherstellen, dass ein Produkt noch einwandfrei ist. Als ein Kernelement dieses Berichtes wurden deshalb sogenannte MHD+ Abgabegrenzen definiert. Das sind Zeitangaben, wie lange nach Ablauf des MHDs Produkte bei korrekter Lagerung in der Regel einwandfrei und sicher sind und folglich abgegeben werden dürfen (MHD + bis  Tage, je nach Lebensmittelkategorie). Die MHD+ Abgabegrenzen wurden aufgrund von einer Marktanalyse mit über  Produkten sowie der für die Mikrobiologie relevanten Produkteigenschaften festgelegt und mit MHD+ Abgabegrenzen ausländischer Leitfäden aus den Niederlanden, Italien, Frankreich und England abgeglichen. Innerhalb dieser MHD+ Abgabegrenzen wird empfohlen, Lebensmittel nach visueller Prüfung noch zu reduziertem Preis in Verkehr zu bringen oder in Form von Lebensmittelspenden zu verteilen.Von Produkten mit einem MHD grundsätzlich zu unterscheiden sind Produkte mit einem Verbrauchsdatum (VD). Diese dürfen nach Ablauf des Datums nicht mehr in Verkehr gebracht werden, weil dann die Lebensmittelsicherheit nicht mehr gewährleistet werden kann, auch wenn das Produkt sensorisch noch einwandfrei scheint. Bei Produkten mit einem VD, welche sich zum Tieffrieren eignen, wird aber empfohlen, die Produkte bis spätestens am Tag des Datums zwecks Haltbarkeitsverlängerung einzufrieren und so die Verteilung zum Konsumenten sicherzustellen. Dabei ist wiederum das Prinzip der Selbstkontrolle zu befolgen, die Lebensmittelsicherheit zu gewährleisten sowie die Informationspflicht wahrzunehmen.Der Bericht gibt weitere Empfehlungen zur Abgabe von «Ultrafrischprodukten», gekühlten Fertiggerichten und frisch zubereiteten Speisen, undatierten Früchten, Gemüsen und Backwaren sowie fehletikettierten Lebensmitteln. Zudem zeigt der Bericht in Anlehnung an die Praxis anderer EU-Länder auf das Schweizer Lebensmittelrecht abgestützte Möglichkeiten für die Deklaration von Inhaltsstoffen und Allergenen bei der Spende von Lebensmitteln im Offenverkauf.Mit den rechtlichen Abklärungen, den MHD+ Abgabegrenzen für individuelle Produktekategorien sowie weiteren Empfehlungen zeigt dieser Bericht auf, wie der Gross- und Detailhandel Lebensmittel so lange in Verkehr bringen kann, wie sie sicher und einwandfrei sind. Der Bericht bildet somit eine wichtige Entscheidungsgrundlage für Inverkehrbringer und insbesondere Spendenorganisationen, um Lebensmittelabfälle zu verhindern und ihren Beitrag zur Erreichung des Sustainable Development Goals «Food Waste Halbierung bis » zu leisten.","doc_id":3191,"prior":"Lebensmittelverluste","sdg12":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19403","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"A novel proposition for a citrate-modified photo-Fenton process against bacterial contamination of microalgae cultures","authors":"Pulgarin, Adrian; Giannakis, Stefanos; Pulgarin, César; Ludwig, Christian; Refardt, Dominik","subject":"Microalgae cultivation; Contamination; Photo-Fenton; Disinfection;  Biologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"A novel proposition for a citrate-modified photo-Fenton process against bacterial contamination of microalgae cultures; Microalgae cultivation; Contamination; Photo-Fenton; Disinfection;  Biologie; This study reports the first attempt of a citrate-modified photo-Fenton (PF) application at near-neutral pH (. to ., tap water) to disinfect Escherichia coli (as model bacterium), in Chlorella vulgaris cultures.

Lebensmittelverschwendung bringt eine CO-Emmisson mit sich, welche in vielen Fällen nicht nötigt wäre. Die vorliegende Arbeit ist ein Teil vom Projekt «Obst vom Baum». Das Projekt selbst hat zum Ziel die Verschwendung von Obst in der Schweiz zu vermindern. Das Endprodukt des Projekts «Obst vom Baum» soll eine Webapplikation sein, über welche nicht geerntetes Obst angeboten und nachgefragt werden kann. Die vorliegende Arbeit baut auf Bachelorarbeiten auf, welche als erster Teil des Projektes bereits verfasst wurden.Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist, den bestehenden Programmcode aus den vorgängigen Bachelorarbeiten so zusammenzuführen, dass ein automatisiertes Backend für den produktiven Einsatz der Webapplikation zur Verfügung steht. Ausgehend von den Analysen der letztjährigen Arbeiten, wird dabei ein Fokus auf die Performance der zu implementierenden Funktionalitäten gelegt.Neben der vorliegenden Arbeit wird zeitgleich das Frontend der Webapplikation implementiert. Dies hat Einfluss auf das gesamte Vorgehen. Somit wird bei der Erarbeitung von Lösungen, stark auf die Anforderungen des Frontends eingegangen. Initial wird der Programmcode der letztjährigen Arbeiten, sowie die Erkenntnisse analysiert. Dies ist die Grundlage für die weitere Erarbeitung von Programmcode. Die Anforderungen werden in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Dozenten und dem Studierenden der Bachelorarbeit «Frontend » erarbeitet. Weiter wird für die Umsetzung des Programmcodes Internetrecherche betrieben oder Tests durchgeführt.Der Programmcode ist so implementiert, dass die gestellten Anforderungen erfüllt wurden. Verglichen zu den letztjährigen Arbeiten, wurden diverse Anpassungen an der Datenbankstruktur und den Funktionalitäten des Backends gemacht. Am Framework der vorgängigen Bachelorarbeit, von JavaSpringBoot mit Anbindung an eine MongoDatenbank, wird weiterhin festgehalten.Als Fazit steht, dass der implementierte Programmcode soweit für den produktiven Betrieb bereit ist, die gewünschten Funktionalitäten umgesetzt wurden und die durchgeführten Tests erfolgreich waren. Weiter können Standard-Aufgaben, welche durch einen Administrator durchzuführen sind, einfach abgearbeitet werden.Für künftige Implementationen stehen mehrere Möglichkeiten zur Verfügung. Ein Ausbau der Testautomatisierung ist erstrebenswert. So können zukünftige Implementationen, einfacher getestet und somit auch schneller implementiert werden. Eine weitere Funktionalität, welche Sinn macht, sobald die Nutzerzahlen steigen, ist die Integration der Administrationsaufgaben in das Frontend. Dies würde auch Anpassungen im Backend bedeuten, da entsprechende Requests noch fehlen. Da die Bauern von den Bauernverbänden validiert werden und diese Arbeit für die Qualität der Daten sehr wichtig ist, sollte man ebenfalls allfällige Anforderungen der Bauernverbände berücksichtigen. Ebenfalls gibt es noch diverse kleinere Anpassungsmöglichkeiten, wie Programmcode-Refactoring, UIVerbesserungen im E-Mail-Service und zusätzliche Tasks für die Datenbankbereinigung.","doc_id":3381,"prior":"Lebensmittelverschwendung","sdg12":1},{"id":"97","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6997","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Your retirement and my health behavior : evidence on retirement externalities from a fuzzy regression discontinuity design","authors":"Müller, Tobias; Shaikh, Mujaheed","subject":"Retirement externality; fuzzy regression; Discontinuity design; Health behavior;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Your retirement and my health behavior : evidence on retirement externalities from a fuzzy regression discontinuity design; Retirement externality; fuzzy regression; Discontinuity design; Health behavior;  Medizin und Gesundheit; This paper presents evidence on intra-household retirement externalities by assessing the causal effect of spousal retirement on various health behaviors and health status across  European countries.

This is important, as the application of this technology is an opportunity to deliver new value propositions for customers, and for the supplier to gain deeper understanding of the actual performance of the equipment (Kowalkowski and Ulaga, ). This builds upon the assessment of service value co-creation supported by digital twin technologies (Meierhofer & West, ).Design/Methodology/Approach: Ten cases have been assessed in this paper using different dimensions, and a cross-case analysis to consider value co-creation, value measures, support to the value proposition, and the servitization context. All of the cases are from an Innosuisse-supported project in Switzerland and were selected for their diversity.Findings: Classifying the digital twins by service proved useful to understand each one and its position within the business system. Knowing which business functions the twin supports helps to identify and confirm value co-creation opportunities as well as the possible areas impacted. It also provides different servitization perspectives that can support new and disruptive models, which is helpful for firms looking for new services to support their customers. The lifecycle perspective confirms the links between different phases and can provide new insight for the development of digital twins.

Therefore, the early recognition of crises has not been a focal point of business research in the past decades. The development of a conceptual framework would not only be beneficial for the company and the management, by predicting imminent crisis situations, but also for the employees, who would no longer be part of extreme downsizing campaigns. Therefore, the research hypothesis focused on challenging the existing consensus. By stating that a reliable framework would be able to prevent corporate turnarounds, the objective of this thesis was given. The created framework, consisting several analytical methods, including a multiple discriminant analysis and a logistic regression, was applied to several cases of corporate crises. The inclusion of companies operating in different industries in the analysis sample ensured the cross-industry predictive capabilities of the developed framework. The analysis relied on audited, publicly available financial information from annual reports. By focusing on the existing errors in crisis recognition, it was ensured that the developed framework creates added value for company executives.Overall, it was concluded that the created EWS model is a step forward regarding crisis recognition and possibly serves as the foundation for a more extensive framework in the future. By complementing the created model with qualitative factors, the cause-analysis of looming crises could be facilitated. Another way of improving on the conceptual framework would be the analysis of industry-specific scales, which would facilitate its interpretation.","doc_id":3566,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"100","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6751","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Multiple signals regulate trafficking of the mannose 6-phosphate-uncovering enzyme","authors":"Lee, Wang-Sik; Rohrer, Jack; Kornfeld, Rosalind; Kornfeld, Stuart","subject":" Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2002","for_data_analysis":"Multiple signals regulate trafficking of the mannose -phosphate-uncovering enzyme;  Biochemie; The \"uncovering enzyme,\" which catalyzes the second step in the formation of the mannose -phosphate recognition marker on lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharides, resides primarily in the trans-Golgi network and cycles between this compartment and the plasma membrane.

However, it is still an open question whether preferences for anthropomorphically designed products can be attenuated by contextual factors. Assuming that consumers are sensitive to the value (e.g. functional or emotional benefits from usage) product design communicates, we postulated that consumers should prefer anthropomorphic designs mainly when future consumption serves emotional, but not functional, goals. In an experiment, where participants were exposed to different kinds of consumption scenarios, we found that participants' preferences for anthropomorphic designs varied with the scenarios.

Sensors are equipped with a wireless link that allows them to transfer data to other devices or to get information from them. This opens up many applications with high volume potential. The promise of a large market has led to an abundance of Bluetooth Smart solutions, which is a good thing for the consumer. Competition will lead to improved quality and will drive costs down. But there is also the danger of a maintenance nightmare, if questions such as energy consumption and security are not properly addressed. Sensors need a power source and the way this is often done is to use batteries. They are small and low cost. But maintenance of sensors powered by small batteries means finding them (if one can still remember where they are) and changing the batteries. This is both resource consuming and ecologically expensive. Energy harvesting can help bring the needed autonomy, reduce and even eliminate the maintenance issues as far as energy is concerned. So far however, energy harvesting has proved expensive. In this work, we use a new power management system to design a sensor that runs day and night on energy harvested using a very small solar cell.  Part of the energy harvested when there is enough light is stored for use at night.

Inexpensive and easy to implement, these heat pumps are, however, less efficient than their ground- or water-source counterparts. In this modeling study, we aim at increasing the efficiency of air-source heat pumps using domestic greywater-contained heat. We assess the performance improvement relative to standard heat pump configurations across various climates, seasons, building envelopes, and domestic hot water consumption patterns. The results show that the annually-averaged coefficient of performance improves by .% on average – ranging from .% to .%. This efficiency gain translates on average to . kWh/week of compressor electricity savings. Although attractive due to its simplicity, the proposed open-loop configuration – preheating of an external heat source – only leads to moderate performance improvement of air-source heat pumps. Based on these results, we extensively discuss and compare alternative system configurations and identify several fundamental differences in the heat recovery dynamics of each configuration. We show that closed-loop systems – using greywater as direct heat source – show the largest performance improvement potential, although being more expensive and complex to implement.","doc_id":3838,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1867","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Condition monitoring with energy harvesting from vibrations","authors":"Gruber, Juan-Mario; Toma, Patrick","subject":" Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"621.3","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Condition monitoring with energy harvesting from vibrations;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; This paper presents a concept for wireless sensor nodes using vibration energy harvesting.

Thus, there is an urgent demand by the cosmetic industry for standardized and customized in vitro artificial organomimetic skin models for substance testing. Todays, human skin models are manually manufactured rather simple and not reflecting the complexity of native skin. Furthermore, quality control is only possible at the end of the production process, whereas it would be desirable to control the entire process in situ to select for properly built skin models at any time point thereby reducing costs. Bioprinting is an upcoming technology in the field of tissue engineering where cell-containing scaffolds are produced in a layer by layer deposition process in order to create D tissue specific models. This technique allows the creation of a biological composite system by controlling the exact deposition of cells, growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in a spatially controlled manner. The goal of this project is the automated production of complex and innovative full-thickness skin models with in situ quality control incorporated into a bioprinting instrument. We developed a printable hydrogel that fulfills four important criteria: It is highly viscous to maintain the structure, before it is photopolymerized within seconds, it provides cell binding sites and is cell-compatible. In order to produce a dermis equivalent alternating layers of scaffold material (PEG diacrylate, methacrylated hyaluronic acid, collagen I, photoinitiator) and human dermal fibroblasts in medium were printed. After each printed scaffold layer the structure was instantaneously photopolymerized with an integrated UV LED ( nm ±  nm,  mW/cm,  s). These cell-containing scaffolds were cultivated for  days in medium. The cell-containing scaffolds were stable throughout the whole time period and the fibroblast remained viable determined by MTT and spread inside the scaffold. In order to provide an in situ quality control an OCT-system was implemented into the bioprinting device. It is possible to discriminate between epidermal and dermal skin layers with images obtained with the OCT-system. This finding is crucial to analyze the differentiation progress of keratinocytes in the epidermis.We printed a fibroblast-containing D structure. The OCT-system is suitable for in situ quality control and is incorporated into the bioprinting instrument. Next steps include keratinocyte printing on top of the dermal layer and incorporating RGD-peptides into the scaffold to generate a fully-defined skin equivalent.","doc_id":3906,"prior":"production process","sdg12":1},{"id":"81","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24443","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Suffizienz in der Ernährung : Entwicklung und Durchführung eines Workshops zur Förderung suffizienter Ernährungsweisen","authors":"Nydegger, Vera","subject":"Suffizienz; Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung; Suffiziente Ernährung; Ernährungssystem; Kompetenzorientierung; Workshop; informelle Erwachsenenbildung; Ernährung; Nachhaltige Entwicklung; Bildung;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Diätetik","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333, 613.2","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Suffizienz in der Ernährung : Entwicklung und Durchführung eines Workshops zur Förderung suffizienter Ernährungsweisen; Suffizienz; Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung; Suffiziente Ernährung; Ernährungssystem; Kompetenzorientierung; Workshop; informelle Erwachsenenbildung; Ernährung; Nachhaltige Entwicklung; Bildung;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Diätetik; Die Ernährung gehört zu den ressourcenintensivsten Lebensbereichen in westlichen Gesellschaf-ten.

So far the necessary drying was done by thermal methods with high inputs of energy. In this project we investigate hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) as CO saving and cost efficient alternative to dry sewage sludge on industrial scale. The focus in this applied research project is on the process water treatment, the mechanical dewatering, the potential use of HTC coal, the recycling of phosphorus and heavy metals and an assessment of environmental effects of HTC compared to current treatments.The potential for biological decomposition was investigated in HTC process water and permeat, which was gained by membrane filtration of HTC process water. A medium to high decomposition rate was shown for organic matter in HTC process water and permeat by aerobic and anaerobic processes in batch experiments. In a continuous aerobic laboratory reactor the HTC process water and permeat showed decomposition rates of -% for chemical oxygen demand (COD) at a specific load of - kg COD/(m reactor volume*d). In the competition for a HTC-stage at the Oftringen waste water treatment plant (WWTP) an increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) due to the addition of HTC-permeate is limited to  mg/l in the effluent of the WWTP. This value can be reached by an optimised membrane filtration with no further treatment for most cases.Advantages of HTC for the mechanical dewatering were shown with a filter press on industrual scale. HTC coal was successfully burned in mono- and mixed combustion plants on industrial scale, for example at Jura Cement in Wildegg or the sludge combustion plant (SVA) in Winterthur. At SVA additional fossil fuels could be temporarily fully substituted by HTC coal. Additional experiments on industrial scale are planned. No evidence of decreased recycling capability of phosphorus or heavy metals after carbonisation was found.Compared to the currently applied sewage sludge drying process the waste heat could be reduced by up to % and the electricity demand by up to % with HTC.

At the core of this topic is the specific clonal group referred to as Escherichia coli Ob:H sequence type  (ST ). It is an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli strain, postulated to be responsible for the spread of ESBL-encoding genes worldwide. This literature review aimed to evaluate ST  as a foodborne pathogen in Switzerland, in order to assess the risk it poses for food producers in Switzerland specifically. On a global scale, ST  has been identified on all continents. It is mostly associated with chicken and poultry meat, and has been isolated from retail products many times. Not exclusive to chicken, it was rarely identified from fish guts and gills. In all other meat products, ST  was found only in faecal matter, not in the product itself. Besides meat, the pathogen was not identified from any sources such as dairy, fruit and vegetables. The situation is similar in Switzerland, where it was isolated frequently from chicken, rarely from fish and a complete absence of the pathogen in all other food product groups. The risk, ST  poses to-wards Swiss food producers has been evaluated as a medium risk factor for both chicken and fish products, and a low risk factor for any other products. Despite ST  being evaluated as a medium-to-low risk factor, depending on the product, it is still recommended to perform further research on the topic. Especially looking to-wards prevalence in Swiss food, in chicken and poultry meat, but also in fish. Specifically fish designated for raw consumption (Sushi, Sashimi). Moreover, the spread of aforementioned ESBL-encoding genes is hypothesized to occur also during infection of humans. This leads to the recommendation, that ST  should be considered a food-safety risk in all products, in order to eliminate said spread. Whether this consideration as a food-safety risk is feasible, cannot be said without further analysis of products and viable treatment options.","doc_id":4113,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"75","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15805","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Optimum lifecycle management of asset portfolios with non-monetary value realization","authors":"Heitz, Christoph","subject":"Asset management; ISO 55000;  Produktionssteuerung","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.5","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Optimum lifecycle management of asset portfolios with non-monetary value realization; Asset management; ISO ;  Produktionssteuerung; The economics of production systems depends on how expenses in terms of lifecycle costs for machines are balanced by revenues. Most classical models for optimizing lifecycle decisions are based on a profit maximization paradigm. However, the solutions are strongly dependent on how the technical performance of the machine is translated into monetary units. This is a critical issue because often it is not easy to monetarize non-ideal behavior of machines (e.g. How to monetarize the image damage of the company resulting from a major production outage?).In the present paper, we present a new perspective on the economics of production systems which is not based on a monetary (profit maximization) paradigm. Instead, we model a production system as an object that (a) needs investment, and (b) generates a value for the company, but this value can be expressed in arbitrary units. This is consistent with the approach of the new ISO standard ’. In such a framework, it is no more possible to base decision making on maximization of a single objective such as profit, as costs and value are measured in different units and cannot be added. However, many lifecycle decision problems can still be solved. In particular, we discuss typical lifecycle problems such as determining optimal lifetime or optimum maintenance levels. We show that, given a portfolio of machines, the optimum decisions for the single machines can be determined, with exception of a single global parameter that holds for the portfolio as a whole. For our approach, we combine approaches from economic utility theory and multidimensional optimization with lifecycle models of technical assets.","doc_id":4186,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16696","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The trilemma between accuracy, timeliness and smoothness in real-time signal extraction","authors":"Wildi, Marc; McElroy, Tucker S.","subject":"Concurrent filters; Frequency domain; Pass-band; Phase delay; Trends;  Wirtschaft;  Naturwissenschaften","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"330, 500","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"The trilemma between accuracy, timeliness and smoothness in real-time signal extraction; Concurrent filters; Frequency domain; Pass-band; Phase delay; Trends;  Wirtschaft;  Naturwissenschaften; In Press, Corrected Proof, Available online  April ; The evaluation of economic data and the monitoring of the economy is often concerned with an assessment of the mid- and long-term dynamics of time series (trend and/or cycle).

Unfortunately, real-time signal extraction is a difficult estimation problem that involves linear combinations of possibly infinitely many multi-step ahead forecasts of a series.

We decompose the ordinary mean squared error into accuracy, timeliness and smoothness error components, and we propose a new tradeoff between these competing terms, the so-called ATS-trilemma.

GoalIncreased energy supply from photovoltaics is a main priority in the “Energy Strategy ”. Within the research project “PV: Sustainability, market deployment and interaction to the grid – the impacts of advanced photovoltaic solutions” funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, we analysed different options for the enhanced integration of photovoltaic (PV) technologies into the envelope of Swiss buildings using novel monolithic silicon heterojunction organometallic perovskite tandem cells (SHJ-PSC) with adaptions to improve the visual acceptance. In a joint effort of product developers, architects and scientists, this project aimed at providing pathways for the wide-scale use of PV façade solutions, and developing integrated designs based on emerging high-efficiency module technologies to improve the visual aspect and acceptance of PV systems installed in Switzerland. These so-called active façades using photovoltaic modules to produce electricity can provide a significant contribution to the energy transition away from fossil and nuclear fuels.. MethodsWe compared the environmental impacts of different types of construction for building façades with and without integrated monolithic silicon heterojunction perovskite tandem modules (SHJ-PSC) with improved visual design using a prospective life cycle assessment with a time horizon of . The comparison includes a conventional roughcast façade, a wooden façade, and two different active façades using photovoltaic modules. Furthermore, we compared the environmental impacts caused by the construction of the different façades with the environmental impacts saved due to the electricity produced by the active façades composed of photovoltaic modules. In addition, we analysed the reduction in environmental impact of the building using building-integrated photovoltaics due to substitution of construction materials for the façade or roof.. ResultsThe use of photovoltaic modules as façade or roof will increase the environmental impact of the façade or roof compared to the use of conventional construction materials. However, the environmental impacts over the whole life cycle are significantly reduced due to the PV electricity produced by the building. The environmental impacts of the BIPV façade are about two to three times higher compared to a conventional façade, but the savings due to the electricity produced by the BIPV are five to eight times higher than the impacts of the conventional façade.

In this article, we argue that the field of soft robotics offers novel approaches meeting the specific requirements of space flight. We present one especially promising construction principle, so called Tensairity, in some detail. Tensairity, as the name suggests, takes ideas from Tensegrity, but uses inflatable structures instead of cables and struts. Soft robots pose substantial challenges with respect to control. One way to meet these challenges is given by the concept of morphological computation and control. Morphological computation can be loosely defined as the exploitation of the shape, material properties, and dynamics of a physical system to improve the efficiency of computation and to deal with systems for which it is difficult to construct a virtual representation using a kinematic model. We discuss fundamental aspects of morphological control and their relevance for space flight. Besides low weight, small consumption of space in the inactive state and advantageous properties with respect to intrinsic safety and energy consumption, we discuss how the blurring of the discrimination of hard- and software leads to control strategies that require only very little and very simple electronic circuitry (which is beneficial in an environment with high irradiation). Finally, we present a research strategy that bundles activities in space flight with research and development in medicine, especially for support systems for an aging population, that are faced with similar morphological computing challenges to astronauts. Such a combination meets the demands for research that is not only effective, but also efficient with respect to economic resources.","doc_id":4643,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/178","date":"2015","language":"en","title":"Bidirectional Communication for Bluetooth Low Energy without establishing a connection","authors":"Truninger, Dominique; Fabbroni, Tiziano","subject":"Bidirektionale Kommunikation; Bluetooth Low Energy; Ble; Beacon; Advertising; Bidirectional Communication; Ble; Bluetooth Low Energy;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Informatik","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"621.3, 004","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Bidirectional Communication for Bluetooth Low Energy without establishing a connection; Bidirektionale Kommunikation; Bluetooth Low Energy; Ble; Beacon; Advertising; Bidirectional Communication; Ble; Bluetooth Low Energy;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik;  Informatik; This paper discusses different concepts and ideas for implementing a bidirectional communication for Bluetooth low energy devices without establishing a connection.

For the recovery of plant nutrients and production of climate-neutral fuel from wet waste streams, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has been suggested as a promising technology. In this study, digested sewage sludge (DSS) was used as waste material for phosphorus and nitrogen recovery. HTC was conducted at  °C for  h, followed by phosphorus stripping (PS) or leaching (PL) at room temperature. The results showed that for PS and PL around % and % of phosphorus, as well as % and % of nitrogen, respectively, could be recovered in the liquid phase (process water and/or extract). Heavy metals were mainly transferred to the hydrochar and only < ppm of Cd and – ppm of Zn were found to be in the liquid phase of the acid treatments. According to the economic feasibility calculation, the HTC-treatment per dry ton DSS with an industrial-scale plant would cost around  USD. Between – kg of sulfuric acid are required per dry ton DSS to achieve a high yield in phosphorus recovery, which causes additional costs of – USD.

Although high efficiency of hESC differentiation to keratinocytes (hESC-Kert) has been achieved, little is known regarding the effects of early culture microenvironment and pertinent extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions during epidermal commitment on subsequent proliferative capacity of hESC-Kert. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the different ECM microenvironments during hESC differentiation on subsequent replicative life span of hESC-Kert. In doing so, H-hESCs were differentiated to keratinocytes (H-Kert) in two differentiation systems. The first system employed autologous fibroblast feeder support, in which keratinocytes (H-KertACC) were derived by coculture of hESCs with hESC-derived fibroblasts (H-ebFs). The second system employed a novel decellularized matrix from H-ebFs to create a dermoepidermal junction-like (DEJ) matrix. H-KertAFF were derived by differentiation of hESCs on the feeder-free system employing the DEJ matrix. Our study indicated that the feeder-free system with the use of DEJ matrix was more efficient in differentiation of hESCs toward epidermal progenitors. However, the feeder-free system was not sufficient to support the subsequent replicative capacity of differentiated keratinocytes. Of note, H-KertAFF showed limited replicative capacity with reduced telomere length and early cellular senescence. We further showed that the lack of cell-cell interactions during epidermal commitment led to heightened production of TGF-β by hESC-Kert during extended culture, which in turn was responsible for resulting in the limited replicative life span with cellular senescence of hESC-Kert derived under the feeder-free culture system. This study highlights for the first time the importance of the culture microenvironment and cell-ECM interactions during differentiation of hESCs on subsequent replicative life span and cellular senescence of the differentiated keratinocytes, with implications for use of these cells for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","doc_id":4941,"prior":"life span","sdg12":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3221","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A framework for efficient information management","authors":"Dreher, Michael; Goetze, Daniel; Wieland, Robert; Liebhart, Daniel","subject":"Quality Management; ILM; Informationsmanagement; Architecture;  Leitendes Management","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"658.4","year":"2008","for_data_analysis":"A framework for efficient information management; Quality Management; ILM; Informationsmanagement; Architecture;  Leitendes Management; Since information is more and more recognised as a business relevant asset the need for an integrated information management approach grows steadily.

Es handelt sich um eine durch menschliches Verhalten geprägte Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie. Durch selbstauferlegte Einschränkungen in verschiedenen Lebensbereichen wie Mobilität oder Konsum, wird eine Reduktion der Umweltauswirkungen erreicht. Der Teilaspekt Ernährung wurde bis jetzt als Forschungsgegenstand in der Suffizienzforschung weitgehend vernachlässigt. Mit der vorliegenden Arbeit soll der negativen Konnotation von Suffizienz als Strategie des „Verzichts“ in Bezug auf die Ernährung entgegengewirkt werden. Über die Literatur und die Durchführung qualitativer Interviews wurden Determinanten identifiziert, die als Rahmenbedingung für eine suffiziente Ernährungsweise betrachtet werden können. Mithilfe dieser konnten aus den Interviews verschiedene Typen suffizienter Ernährungsweise abgeleitet werden. Die Arbeit orientierte sich dabei an folgenden Forschungsfragen: ) Welche Typen sich suffizient ernährender Menschen existieren? ) Aus welchen Gründen (Motivation) entscheiden sich Menschen dafür, sich suffizient zu ernähren? Es zeigte sich, dass fünf Rahmenbedingungen für eine suffiziente Ernährungsweise ausschlaggebend sind: die persönlichen Werte eines Menschen, seine dem Handeln zugrunde liegenden Ziele, Einflüsse wie soziales Umfeld oder Familie, das persönliche Verhalten und die Auswirkungen dieses Ernährungsverhaltens auf das Individuum und die Umwelt. Die vier Rahmenbedingungen Werte, Ziele, Verhalten und Auswirkungen ergaben sich aus der Literatur. Während der Befragungen zeigte sich, dass eine zusätzliche, fünfte Rahmenbedingung für eine suffiziente Ernährungsweise zentral ist: die Einflüsse. Basierend auf diesen Rahmenbedingungen konnten aus den Interviews vier Typen sich suffizient ernährender Menschen abgeleitet werden: Die Nachhaltigen, die Gesunden, die Sportlichen und die Bewussten. Mit den erarbeiteten Rahmenbedingungen könnten weitere Typen sich suffizient ernährender Menschen identifiziert werden. So werden Handlungsmöglichkeiten in der suffizienten Ernährung aufgezeigt, die auch nicht aus nachhaltigen Gründen agierende Menschen ansprechen. Die Motivation, warum sich die in den Interviews Befragten suffizient ernähren, konnte dabei unterschiedlicher Natur sein und war nicht zwingend beim Wert Nachhaltigkeit zu finden. Einige gaben an, aus gesundheitlichen Gründen auf gewisse Produkte zu verzichten, andere zur körperlichen Leistungssteigerung und wieder andere aus religiösen Gründen. Die Mehrheit der Befragten erzählte, sich durch die Änderung des Ernährungsverhaltens gesünder und wohler zu fühlen.; Sufficiency is usually regarded as a general concept. It is a sustainability strategy determined by human behaviour. Self-imposed restrictions in various areas of life, such as mobility or consumption, reduce environmental impacts.The sub-aspect of diet has so far been largely neglected as a research subject in sufficiency research. The present study aims to counteract the negative connotation of sufficiency as a strategy of \"renunciation\" with regard to diet. Through the literature and the conduct of qualitative interviews, determinants were identified which can be considered as a framework for a sufficient diet. With the help of these determinants, different types of sufficient diet could be identified from the interviews. The work was based on the following research questions: ) What types of people who eat enough exist? ) For what reasons (motivation) do people decide to eat sufficient?It was shown that five factors are decisive for a sufficient diet. These factors are: the personal values of a person, his or her goals behind his or her actions, influences such as social environment or family, personal behaviour and the effects of this dietary behaviour on the individual and the environment. The four basic conditions values, goals, behaviour and effects were derived from the literature. During the interviews it became apparent that an additional, fifth framework condition is central to a sufficient diet: the influences. Based on these conditions, four types of people who eat sufficient could be derived from the interviews: the sustainable, the healthy, the athletic and the aware. With the framework conditions developed, further types of people who eat sufficient could be identified. This would make it possible to identify options for action in the area of sufficiency that would also appeal to people who do not act for sustainable reasons.The motivation why the interviewees eat sufficient could be of different nature and was not necessarily found in the value of sustainability. Some stated that they did not use certain products for health reasons, others to improve physical performance and still others for religious reasons. The majority of respondents said they felt healthier and more comfortable by changing their dietary habits.","doc_id":5095,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5966","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Advances in understanding energy consumption behavior and the governance of its change : outline of an integrated framework","authors":"Burger, Paul; Bezençon, Valéry; Bornemann, Basil; Brosch, Tobias; Carabias-Hütter, Vicente; Farsi, Mehdi; Hille, Stefanie Lena; Moser, Corinne; Ramseier, Céline; Samuel, Robin; Sander, David; Schmidt, Stephan; Sohre, Annika; Volland, Benjamin","subject":"Governance of individual behavior; Interdisciplinary framework; Behavior change; Energy-related consumption pattern;  Psychologie;  Energie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"150, 333.79","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Advances in understanding energy consumption behavior and the governance of its change : outline of an integrated framework; Governance of individual behavior; Interdisciplinary framework; Behavior change; Energy-related consumption pattern;  Psychologie;  Energie; Transforming today’s energy systems in industrialized countries requires a substantial reduction of the total energy consumption at the individual level. Selected instruments have been found to be effective in changing people’s behavior in single domains. However, the so far weak success story on reducing overall energy consumption indicates that our understanding of the determining factors of individual energy consumption as well as of its change is far from being conclusive. Among others, the scientific state of the art is dominated by analyzing single domains of consumption and by neglecting embodied energy. It also displays strong disciplinary splits and the literature often fails to distinguish between explaining behavior and explaining change of behavior. Moreover, there are knowledge gaps regarding the legitimacy and effectiveness of the governance of individual consumption behavior and its change. Against this backdrop, the aim of this paper is to establish an integrated interdisciplinary framework that offers a systematic basis for linking the different aspects in research on energy related consumption behavior, thus paving the way for establishing a better evidence base to inform societal actions. The framework connects the three relevant analytical aspects of the topic in question: () it systematically and conceptually frames the objects, i.e., the energy consumption behavior and its change (explananda); () it structures the factors that potentially explain the energy consumption behavior and its change (explanantia); () it provides a differentiated understanding of change inducing interventions in terms of governance. Based on the existing states of the art approaches from different disciplines within the social sciences, the proposed framework is supposed to guide interdisciplinary empirical research.","doc_id":5129,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"85","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16474","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"An active tagging system using circular-polarization modulation","authors":"Kossel, M.A.; Kung, Roland; Benedickter, H.; Biichtokd, W.","subject":"RFID; Modulation; Frequency-hopping; Microwave;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"004, 621.3","year":"1999","for_data_analysis":"An active tagging system using circular-polarization modulation; RFID; Modulation; Frequency-hopping; Microwave;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; An active read/write microwave tagging system using circular-polarization modulation as a novel modulation scheme for radio-frequency identification systems is presented.

The canonical dipole emission model is parametrized in terms of the local optical material constants and the local quasi-Fermi level splitting using the detailed balance relation between local absorption and emission rates. The framework obtained in this way is shown to reproduce the generalized Kirchhoff relations between the luminescent emission from metal halide perovskite slabs under uniform excitation and the slab absorptance of light with arbitrary angle of incidence. Use of the proper local density of transverse photon states in the local emission rate includes cavity effects in the generalized Planck law for internal spontaneous emission, which are neglected in the conventional Van Roosbroeck-Shockley formalism and avoids spurious divergencies due to non-radiative energy transfer via longitudinal modes. Finally, a consistent treatment of re-absorption provides the local rate of secondary photogeneration required for the consideration of photon recycling in an opto-electronic device simulator that includes the effects of charge transport.","doc_id":5157,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22290","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Analyse der Trendentwicklung in der Systemgastronomie während der COVID-19-Krise","authors":"Siebenmann, Camil A.","subject":" Grosshaushaltsführung;  Allgemeines Management","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"647, 658","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Analyse der Trendentwicklung in der Systemgastronomie während der COVID--Krise;  Grosshaushaltsführung;  Allgemeines Management; Megatrends sind treibende Kräfte der Gesellschaft, die einen stetigen Wandel bewirken und auf alle Bereiche des Alltages Einfluss nehmen.

Spätestens seit im Frühjahr  beinahe weltweit das gesamte Leben zum Stillstand gekommen ist, sind die Folgen dieser Krise bemerkbar. Die COVID--Krise wirkt in einigen Fällen als Beschleuniger von Megatrends, andererseits können Megatrends durch sie auch ausgebremst werden. Das Ziel dieser Forschungsarbeit ist es, zu bestimmen, inwiefern die zwei Megatrends Neo-Ökologie und Gesundheit unter dem aktuellen Wirken des COVID--Virus Einfluss auf die Systemgastronomie nehmen. Dazu wird folgende Forschungsfrage gestellt: Welche Faktoren sind während und nach der COVID--Krise erfolgsentscheidend für die Systemgastronomie? Auf theoretischen Grundlagen zu den Themen Systemgastronomie, Megatrends und COVID- werden zur Beantwortung dieser Frage drei qualitative Methoden angewendet. Sie wurden ausgewählt, um verschiedene Blickwinkel auf die Systemgastronomie aufzuzeigen, die sich gegenseitig in ihren Argumenten stützen. Mit Hilfe des Canvas-Business-Modells werden verschiedene Systemgastronomieunternehmen auf ihre Struktur und somit ihre Erfolgsfaktoren analysiert. Anhand dessen wird die Bedeutung der Megatrends sowie der COVID--Krise beurteilt. Um die Forschungsfrage zu beantworten und das Konsumverhalten der Gäste besser einzuordnen, werden einander zwei Online-Konsumentenumfragen gegenübergestellt. Beide beinhalten dieselben Fragen, wobei die erste Umfrage  im Auftrag von Food Service Schweiz durch-geführt wurde und die zweite Umfrage im Rahmen dieser Arbeit im Oktober .Um die Hypothesen, die aus den Ergebnissen der zwei präsentierten Methoden hervorgehen, zu bestätigen und die Ziele dieser Arbeit zu erreichen, wurden drei Experteninterviews durchgeführt.

Transformation by Disaster oder by Design?; Verkehr; Automobilindustrie; Sharing Economy; China; Elektromobilität; Autonomes Fahren;  Produktion; Weltweit lösen sich die etablierten Leitbilder der Automobilität des . Jahrhunderts zunehmend auf. Damit gerät die Automobilwirtschaft in Deutschland und Europa mit ihrer enormen volkswirtschaftlichen, beschäftigungs- und innovationspolitischen Bedeutung unter Druck. Dies geschieht zu einem Zeitpunkt, in dem die Branche sich auf einem Expansionskurs mit steigenden Umsätzen, wachsender Beschäftigung und weiter zunehmenden Exporten befindet. Starke und global wirksame Megatrends, neue Mobilitätsanforderungen in den sich urbanisierenden Verkehrsmärkten und eine bislang nicht bekannte Konkurrenz, etwa durch die aufstrebende IT-Branche, aber auch durch die industriepolitischen Zielsetzungen Chinas, verändern unsere Mobilität. Die damit einhergehende Elektrifizierung, Vernetzung, Automatisierung und Sharing Mobility revolutionieren die Automobilität, sie führen zu einer neuen Automobilität. An die Stelle des fossilen Antriebs treten elektromotorische Aggregate und Speicherkonzepte, anstelle des Selbstfahrens treten die Konzepte des assistierten, automatisierten und autonomen Fahrens, und anstelle des Besitzes tritt die digitale Plattformökonomie mit neuen Geschäftsmodellen und Vertriebsformen. Für die Automobilwirtschaft in Deutschland und Europa kumulieren diese Entwicklungen zu drastischen Angebots und Nachfrageveränderungen, die ihr bisheriges Geschäftsmodell infrage stellen. Mit automobilpolitischer Regulierung und unternehmensinterner Selbsttransformation sind diese Transformationsprozesse nicht mehr zu bewältigen. Politik, Unternehmen, Gewerkschaften und Verbraucher_innen müssen in gemeinsamer Anstrengung einen Wandel im Bereich der Automobilitiät voranbringen. Gelingen kann dies nur mit einem Zukunftspakt für Mobilität, der unternehmerische, politische und gesellschaftliche Strategien mit dem Ziel einer gesamtgesellschaftlichen Verkehrswende zusammenführt. Er steht in der Tradition der kooperativen Bewältigung des wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und gesellschaftlichen Wandels. Politisches Leitbild muss ein nachhaltiges und integriertes Gesamtverkehrssystem unter Einbeziehung des Automobils als Baustein in intermodalen Handlungs- und Transportketten sein. Vor allem die Bundesregierung ist hier gefordert, als zentraler staatlicher Akteur die Prozesse zu koordinieren und zu moderieren, gemeinsam mit den Ländern und Kommunen. Sie muss den regulativen, fiskalischen und strukturpolitischen Handlungsrahmen schaffen, während Unternehmen und Politik in einem transparenten Konsultationsmechanismus die gesellschaftliche Verständigung über einen Zukunftspakt für Mobilität vorantreiben sollten. In einem ersten Schritt sollte ein politisch moderiertes und reguliertes verbraucherseitiges Markttransformationsprogramm für Elektromobilität auf- und auch umgesetzt werden. Es gilt dabei vor allem, Verhaltensweisen der Verbraucher_innen mutig so zu gestalten, dass die Nachfrage für neue und zukunftsfähige Produkte entsteht. Auf europäischer Ebene sieht der Zukunftspakt beispielsweise die Initiierung eines Projekts zum Technologiesprung hin zur Elektromobilität vor. Im Rahmen des Markttransformationsprogramms müssen zudem die Kommunen stärker und umfassender befähigt werden, kommunale Labore zu fördern, in denen sowohl die Autoindustrie als auch die Betreiber des öffentlichen Verkehrs (ÖV) neue Formen der Zusammenarbeit im Hinblick auf die neue Mobilität entwickeln können.","doc_id":5709,"prior":"Sharing Economy","sdg12":1},{"id":"3","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24433","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Phosphorrückgewinnung aus kommunalem Klärschlamm mittels hydrothermaler Karbonisierung und Säureauswaschung : Einfluss von Kohlendioxid-Eingasung auf den Prozess der Hydrothermalen Karbonisierung und der Vergleich verschiedener Nachweismethoden","authors":"Meyer, Luca","subject":"Klärschlamm; Mikrowellenaufschluss; Phosphorrückgewinnung; HTC; Photometrische Phosphorbestimmung; ICP-OES; Kohlendioxid-Eingasung; Schwermetalle;  Technische Chemie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"660","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Phosphorrückgewinnung aus kommunalem Klärschlamm mittels hydrothermaler Karbonisierung und Säureauswaschung : Einfluss von Kohlendioxid-Eingasung auf den Prozess der Hydrothermalen Karbonisierung und der Vergleich verschiedener Nachweismethoden; Klärschlamm; Mikrowellenaufschluss; Phosphorrückgewinnung; HTC; Photometrische Phosphorbestimmung; ICP-OES; Kohlendioxid-Eingasung; Schwermetalle;  Technische Chemie; Die immer knapper werdenden Vorräte an hochwertigem Phosphor stellen die Menschheit vor ein Problem. Um den weltweit steigenden Nahrungsbedarf auch in Zukunft zu decken, sind alternative Phosphorquellen unumgänglich. Eine Möglichkeit diesen Bedarf zu decken, besteht durch das Schliessen von Phosphorkreisläufen. Das im Abwasser anfallende Phosphor sollte zurückgewonnen und der Landwirtschaft in Form von Dünger zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Es sind viele verschiedene Varianten der Phosphorrückgewinnung bekannt und teilweise bereits im Einsatz. In dieser Arbeit wird untersucht, welchen Vorteil die Kombination von zwei verschiedenen Varianten der Phosphorrückgewinnung bringt. Dabei handelt es sich um die hydrothermale Karbonisierung, welches den Klärschlamm karbonisiert und den Phosphor in das Prozesswasser überführt und das Budenheimer-Verfahren, bei welchem der Phosphor des Klärschlammes, bei einer Eingasung von CO, gelöst und ebenfalls in das Prozesswasser überführt wird. Neben der Kombination dieser beiden Verfahren und einer Erfolgskontrolle, wurden verschiedene Phosphornachweismethoden und eine Brennwertanalyse vorgenommen. Die Auswertungen der Kombination der beiden Verfahren mittels ICP-OES hat ergeben, dass mit der Eingasung von CO während der hydrothermalen Karbonisierung doppelt so viel Phosphor ins Prozesswasser überführt werden kann. Dabei handelt es sich jedoch um lediglich . % des im Ausgangsmaterial enthaltenen Phosphor.

Das im Abwasser anfallende Phosphor sollte zurückgewonnen und der Landwirtschaft in Form von Dünger zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Es sind viele verschiedene Varianten der Phosphorrückgewinnung bekannt und teilweise bereits im Einsatz. In dieser Arbeit wird untersucht, welchen Vorteil die Kombination von zwei verschiedenen Varianten der Phosphorrückgewinnung bringt.

Two different peroxides (Luperox  and Peroxan PK P) were used as single initiators for the grafting reaction with and without an additional thermal stabilizer. Infrared spectra of the resulting polymers showed that grafting efficiency was high over the analysed temperature range from °C to °C. A new and more sensitive method, based on head space gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (head space GC–MS), was used to determine optimal grafting efficiencies. Above °C, the grafting efficiency for both initiators was greater than %. In general, grafting with the more reactive peroxide (P) yielded more highly functionalized polymers. Optimization of the grafting process reduces the amount of unreacted grafting material, minimizing levels of free volatile components and reducing energy consumption. Melt viscosities were also analysed to identify unwanted side reactions. In general, compared to polymers produced with P, those made with Luperox  exhibited more rapidly increasing complex viscosity with increasing amounts of initiator. T-peel adhesion tests were used to demonstrate the use of silane-grafted VLDPE as an adhesive on metal substrates. The T-peel strengths of modified VLDPE samples were between . and .

A driving force is the continuing degradation of the environment in many areas of the world, often caused or accelerated by population growth and climate change. Sustainable development is seen as key approach to mitigate these processes. It has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” But how can this ambitious goal be achieved in the light of numerous global challenges? Engineering is a very influential human practice and must be addressed in this context. Engineers are crucially involved in design and construction of our built environment and thus in shaping almost its entire development. However, when designing a solution for a given problem, effects caused outside of the system borders are often not considered. If this is combined with a narrowly confined linear problem-solving approach, it is inherently prone to create new environmental challenges. We postulate that the development of a new design paradigm for engineering must be part of the progress towards sustainable development. We think that this new paradigm needs to integrate a sound understanding of ecological principles, processes, and interdependencies as well as thorough system thinking. We call this ecology-inspired approach to engineering “ecological engineering” and redefine it as follows: Ecological Engineering integrates ecological principles, processes, and organisms with existing engineering practice to a holistic approach for problem-solving. In this paper, we explore the historical development of earlier definitions of Ecological Engineering in the light of their underlying value systems. Based on this analysis, we propose a new conceptual approach for Ecological Engineering and define seven principles that point the way towards a future label that can be conferred to Good Ecological Engineering Practice.","doc_id":5910,"prior":"circular economy","sdg12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5174","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Autarkic monitoring with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)","authors":"Gruber, Juan-Mario","subject":"Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Autonomous measurement system; Condition monitoring; Energy harvesting;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004, 621.3","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Autarkic monitoring with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Autonomous measurement system; Condition monitoring; Energy harvesting;  Informatik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; The concept and realization of an autonomous measurement system is developed to provide an easy-to-implement monitoring solution for vibrating machines.

This allows for a better utilization of a given roof area.In the L-Sol project, a novel system that uses PVT collectors to produce heat for single-family houses was investigated The PVT collectors deliver both electricity and heat for the operation of a heat pump. A main characteristic of the system is a thermal storage tank (“cold water storage”) between the PVT collectors and the heat pump. This storage tank acts as the source for the heat pump. It was shown that the L-Sol concept makes sense in ecologic as well as in economic terms. For new buildings and old, energetically renovated ones, electricity consumption is  to  % lower than with the use of an air-water heat pump. During winter, grid purchase is  to  % below that of an air-water heat pump system combined with PV modules.However, it is difficult to achieve the low costs of an air-water heat pump system. In the L-Sol system, the investment costs for the PVT system (collectors and installation) are the main cost component. Through savings on the collector costs – mainly by using collectors that consist of “normal” PV modules with a retrofitted heat exchanger on the rear side – total life-cycle costs over  years can be reduced to a level similar to that of an air-water heat pump system while maintaining the ecological advantages.On top of the improved system efficiency, the L-Sol system’s main advantage over an air-water heat pump system is the lack of noise emissions on the outside of the building. Compared to systems that are using a combination of PVT collectors and either a geothermal storage (-Sol) or an ice storage, the L-Sol system offers reduced life-cycle costs. Furthermore, it requires no extensive ground works or special building permits. It is therefore also well suited for replacing fossil heating systems in existing buildings.In an in-depth simulation study, main influence factors on the system efficiency were identified and possibilities to reduce the amount of electricity purchased from the grid were shown. The controls of the heat pump were adapted such that the heat pump is purposefully switched on to heat up und overheat the thermal storage for space heating and domestic warm water when there is surplus electricity from the PVT system. Another possibility to reduce grid purchase is to do the heating-up of the space heating buffer mainly during daytime and disable it at night as long as the comfort requirements are not neglected. A combination of these two control approaches can lead to an electricity self-consumption ratio of  %, compared to around  % when using standard controls. On top of these adaptations of the control system, adding a battery storage can further increase the level of self-sufficiency. With a battery storage of  kWh capacity, the self-consumption ratio can be increased to  %. In certain summer months,  % self-sufficiency is possible.The high energy demand and the low energy production during phases of bad weather can be buffered by a well-dimensioned thermal storage between the PVT collectors and the heat pump. By adding an additional hydraulic circuit, this storage can be used to cool down the building during summer. The heat that is extracted from the building is either used for domestic hot water generation or it is given off to the environment via the PVT collectors at night.For easy system dimensioning, so-called dimensioning matrices were created. An interested party can use them to estimate a useful system dimensioning for their house and quickly decide whether the L-Sol system could be an option that is worth a more detailed consideration. Depending on the heating energy demand and the flow temperature of the heating circuit, a typical system for a single-family house consists of  to  uncovered PVT collector modules and a cold water storage with a volume of ’ to ’ l. Furthermore, it includes a heat pump as well as a warm storage, e.g. a -l combined storage.; Mit PVT-Kollektoren wird auf derselben Fläche sowohl (PV-)Strom als auch (solare) Wärme gewonnen. Dies erlaubt eine bessere Ausnutzung der Dachflächen.Im Projekt L-Sol wurde ein neuartiges System untersucht, welches die Wärme für Einfamilienhäuser aus PVT-Kollektoren erzeugt. Die PVT-Kollektoren liefern dabei sowohl Strom als auch Wärme für die Wärmepumpe. Charakteristisch für das System ist ein Pufferspeicher («Kaltwasser-Speicher») zwischen den PVT-Kollektoren und der Wärmepumpe, welcher als Quelle für die Wärmepumpe dient. Es zeigte sich, dass das Konzept L-Sol sowohl ökologisch als auch ökonomisch sinnvoll ist. Der Strombedarf ist bei Neubauten und energetisch sanierten Einfamilienhäusern jeweils  bis  % geringer als beim Einsatz einer Luft-Wasser-Wärmepumpe. In den Wintermonaten liegt der Netzbezug  bis  % unter dem eines Luft-Wasser-Wärmepumpensystem kombiniert mit einer PV-Anlage.Es ist jedoch schwierig, die tiefen Kosten eines Luft-Wasser-Wärmepumpensystems zu erreichen. Im L-Sol-System stellen die Investitionskosten für die PVT-Anlage (Kollektoren inklusive Installation) den grössten Posten dar. Durch Einsparungen bei den Kollektorkosten – insbesondere durch den Einsatz von mit Wärmetauschern nachgerüsteten «normalen» PV-Modulen - lassen sich die Gesamtkosten über  Jahre unter Beibehaltung der ökologischen Vorteile auf das Niveau eines Luft-Wasser-Wärmepumpensystems senken.Neben der höheren Systemeffizienz besteht der Hauptvorteil des L-Sol-Systems gegenüber einem System mit einer Luft-Wasser-Wärmepumpe in den wegfallenden Lärmemissionen im Aussenbereich. Verglichen mit Systemen, die PVT-Kollektoren in Kombination mit einer Erdwärmesonde (-Sol) oder einem Eisspeicher verwenden, weist das L-Sol-System geringere Lebenszykluskosten auf. Ausserdem erfordert es keine umfassenden Bodenarbeiten oder besondere Bewilligungen. Es eignet sich deshalb auch gut für den Ersatz von fossilen Heizungssystemen in bestehenden Gebäuden.In einer vertieften Simulationsstudie wurden wesentliche Einflussfaktoren auf die Systemeffizienz identifiziert und Möglichkeiten aufgezeigt, wie der Strombezug aus dem Netz verringert werden kann. Die Steuerung der Wärmepumpe wurde so angepasst, dass sie bei einem Stromüberschuss aus der PVT-Anlage gezielt eingeschaltet wird, um die Speicher für Warmwasser und Heizung aufzuheizen oder zu überhitzen. Eine weitere Möglichkeit zur Reduktion des Netzbezugs besteht darin, die Beladung des Heizpufferspeichers überwiegend am Tag durchzuführen und in der Nacht zu sperren, sofern keine Komfortanforderungen verletzt werden. Durch Kombination dieser beiden Steuerstrategien kann der Eigenverbrauchsanteil des Stromes auf rund  % gesteigert werden, verglichen mit rund  % bei Verwendung einer Standardsteuerung. Zusätzlich zu diesen Steuerungsanpassungen lässt sich durch die Einbindung eines Batteriespeichers der Autarkiegrad weiter steigern. Mit einem Batteriespeicher von  kWh Kapazität kann ein Autarkiegrad von  % erreicht werden. In einzelnen Sommermonaten ist damit eine -prozentige Autarkie möglich.Der hohe Energiebedarf und der geringe Energieertrag während kurzen Schlechtwetterphasen können durch eine entsprechende Grösse des Speichers zwischen PVT-Kollektoren und Wärmepumpe gepuffert werden. Durch das Hinzufügen eines zusätzlichen hydraulischen Kreislaufs kann derselbe Speicher im Sommer verwendet werden um das Gebäude zu kühlen. Die dem Gebäude entnommene Wärme wird dabei zum einen für die Brauchwarmwasser-Erwärmung verwendet und zum anderen nachts über die PVT-Kollektoren an die Umgebung abgegeben.Zur einfachen System-Dimensionierung wurde eine Dimensionierungsmatrix erstellt.

Especially in terms of energy consumption and device cost, the intensive cryptographic operations of well-known computer security algorithms are a big challenge for resource constrained devices. To face these challenges, semiconductor vendors have recently introduced new dedicated hardware, so called secure elements. These devices provide hardware accelerated support for cryptographic operations and tamper proof memory for the secure storage of cryptographically sensitive material. Moreover, they employ specific techniques against so called side channel attacks. The paper describes and specifies different classes of secure elements and discusses their opportunities and challenges. Furthermore, the paper provides multiple detailed examples how secure elements can be used for different applications. Finally, this paper briefly presents general measurement results from a performed evaluation with four selected secure elements from different vendors. A more complete report about the performed evaluation will be presented in a following paper. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of secure elements and provide a generic overview of their features, serving as starting point to work with secure elements.","doc_id":6048,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"41","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7688","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"From YouTube to protein powder : how Social Media influences the consumption and perception towards nutritional supplements","authors":"Renga, Giuseppe","subject":" Marketingmanagement","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"658.8","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"From YouTube to protein powder : how Social Media influences the consumption and perception towards nutritional supplements;  Marketingmanagement; Posting selfies, showing pictures from the latest workout, and sharing the supplements that help with getting an “Adonis” physique – the Social Media influencer is born. Such occurrences have shaped Social Media in recent years from a networking platform to a multi-million-dollar business platform. Every day, thousands of pictures and videos of a seemingly perfect life are uploaded with one major goal: influencing the consumers in a way to generate sales for the nutritional supplement industry. One group of individuals that is considered to be highly affected by it, is the Generation Y, due to their digital affinity and high presence on Social Media. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the consumer of nutritional supplements and extent that Social Media has on the consumer behavior of nutritional supplements based on the various areas of the consumer buying cycle.The analysis has shown that the consumer behavior differs when nutritional supplements are purchased under the influence of Social Media. Not only is it able to change the perception and opinion towards nutritional supplements in a positive way, it also influences the consumer in the way nutritional supplements are purchased. It was found out that the main purpose for supplementation are deficits in nutrition and weight control and that Social Media is able to generate sales if detailed information about products are provided, as well as positive reviews are given. A key driver for the selection of the product was stated to be the product quality, followed by the value for money. Lastly, there were indications that the increased usage of Social Media would influence the expenditures and consumption frequency of supplements, however, these could not be identified to be statistically significant. Furthermore, it can be said that Social Media and its business channels and influencers are able to act as opinion leaders and influencers in the field of nutritional supplements.The analysis of this paper was conducted with the use of an internet based survey consisting of quantitative and qualitative research instruments and achieved  total participants through snowball sampling. The survey included two groups of individuals for the comparative analysis, a control group (n=) that has never purchased supplements through Social Media before and a research group that has purchased dietary supplements influenced by such platforms (n=).Under to the prevailing circumstances, it is recommended that companies active in the nutritional supplement industry do in fact establish active presence on Social Media. It is of importance for them to produce quality products at a reasonable price and provide the consumers detailed information about such and to place them with the use of Social Media influencers that can act as opinion leaders. Also, it is recommended to establish direct connections to online shops for the purchase of nutritional supplements, as they were found to be the main place of purchase in connection with such platforms.","doc_id":6136,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18105","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts","authors":"Stucki, Matthias; Wettstein, Sarah; Amrein, Simon; Mathis, Alex","subject":"LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Life cycle assessment of peat substitutes : characteristics, availability, environmental sustainability and social impacts; LCA; Horticulture; Carbon Footprint; Peat;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Goal: Peat extraction leads to environmental damage in terms of climate and biodiversity.

We showed the presence of various waterborne agents of gastrointestinal infections in humans, which were associated with leakage occurring around two locations along the wastewater channel.

Today arts and cultural organizations are increasingly faced with strong demands to prove how they add value to their communities and to implement performance measurement procedures as part of their management practices. The arts management literature has proposed numerous approaches to define, measure, and assess the value of arts and cultural activities and its impact on society. Yet, research has remained prevalently normative and instrumental rather than advancing the understanding of the specific artistic and broader contexts in which evaluation is practiced. Further, the literature has been dominated by decontextualized approaches inherent to the dominant positivist paradigm, which assume a context-neutrality of methods and techniques, thus presuming that similar evaluation practices can be applied to different contexts. Increasingly scholars argue that, rather than looking for measureable results and proof of impact, resources would be better spent trying to understand the arts themselves and exploring ways to more responsibly represent their value and contribute to a more effective policy making. This ongoing study contests the decontextualized approaches found within the positivist research paradigm and explores the evaluation practices embedded in the creative process of performing arts organizations. Based on the premise that artistic activities and their outcome/impact can only be evaluated within the contexts and processes that give rise to them, the scope of the empirical work focuses on how performance is enacted by the artists themselves, as experts, self-evaluators, and peer-evaluators. Hence, the originality of the research question lies in putting the creative process at the core of the enquiry and considering the intrinsic aspects of the individual and collective experience and the role of human agency in the art production and consumption. In order to do that used an ethnographic study design that triangulated qualitative data from (non-)participant observation, semi-structured formal and informal interviews, and document analyses in the context of two in-depth case studies. The chosen methodology aims at capturing the unarticulated assumptions and values of creative processes. The preliminary findings, such as the artistic value created by working with a particular artist and in a particular piece for the individual performer or the ensemble as a whole, enhance the existing body of knowledge about artistic value and achievement in the performing arts. The presented fresh insights and novel understanding to the existing literature and provide new opportunities that hopefully contribute researchers, practitioners and policy makers to better define, assess and subsequently, predict performance in the performing arts. In addition, considering that the arts as an extreme case of creative working environment have emerged as a promising research field for business, the study attempts to offer an alternative to mainstream approaches to (e-)valuation, assessment, and impact analysis that may allow relevant stakeholders to gain deeper insights in how to explore creative, knowledge, and experience-intensive processes.","doc_id":6257,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"90","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19208","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Wirtschaftlichkeit von Indooraquaponikfarmen im urbanen Raum in der Schweiz.","authors":"Bosshard, Philipp","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"630","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Wirtschaftlichkeit von Indooraquaponikfarmen im urbanen Raum in der Schweiz.;  Landwirtschaft; Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde untersucht, ob das Konzept von Indooraquaponikfarmen im urbanen Raum in der Schweiz wirtschaftlich erfolgreich umgesetzt werden kann.Aquaponik ist eine Kombination aus Fisch- und Pflanzenzucht in einem rezirkulierendem Aquakultursystem.

Through cooperation with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, the Smiling Gecko Fish Project was launched  years later. In order to promote the education and income of surrounding smallholder women farmers and to counteract gender inequality, the Woman in Aquaculture project was launched. The Sun Oxygen System (SOS) was developed by the ZHAW to enable the planned fish breeding ponds to be aerated independently of the electricity grid. A pump powered by a solar panel transports the surface water, which is supersaturated with oxygen through photosynthesis by algae, into deeper layers. In this way, the excess oxygen does not immediately diffuse into the ambient air but can be stored for longer by the entire water column. For this work, a feeding trial with Nile tilapias was conducted in two fish ponds (water volume  m) to validate the benefits of the SOS. One pond was operated with an SOS, the other without. Besides daily measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, water quality parameters were analysed and SOS performance was monitored. Due to excessive oxygen consumption at night and a clogged SOS pump, the trial was split into two trials. Trial A was started with a fish density of . kg/m (. kg/m). Trial B was continued with a fish density of . kg/m (. kg/m). The daily DO concentrations of the two ponds recorded during Trial B showed a . kg higher oxygen input during the day in the pond with SOS. However, this increased oxygen input was used up again overnight, so that the morning DO concentration with SOS was always lower from the th day (Trial B) of the trial than without SOS, and from the th day (Trial B) onwards no longer rose above  mg/l. Weighing the fish did not yield any useful data, as the feeding trial was stopped early in both trials due to the DO concentration being too low. The sample size of the weighed fish in both trials was considered too small to calculate a representative average weight, as the scatter of the weights was too large. Daily DO concentration curves were used to show the effect of SOS on pond water mixing. While without SOS a stratification with different DO concentrations takes place, with SOS the DO concentration is balanced in the evening. An analysis of the SOS performance showed that on sunny days a power surplus of . kWh is produced, which can be used for additional energy consumers. The reasons for the high oxygen consumption overnight were then discussed. Possible solutions were identified and design changes were proposed for further SOS tests.","doc_id":6432,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17716","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Cultural differences in diet and determinants of diet quality in Switzerland : results from the national nutrition survey menuCH","authors":"Pestoni, Giulia; Krieger, Jean-Philippe; Sych, Janice Marie; Faeh, David; Rohrmann, Sabine","subject":"Diet quality scores; Dietary pattern; Language region; Cross-sectional study; Mediterranean diet; Life style; Socioeconomic factor; Switzerland; Culture; Food quality; Nutrition survey;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613.2, 614","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Cultural differences in diet and determinants of diet quality in Switzerland : results from the national nutrition survey menuCH; Diet quality scores; Dietary pattern; Language region; Cross-sectional study; Mediterranean diet; Life style; Socioeconomic factor; Switzerland; Culture; Food quality; Nutrition survey;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; Sociodemographic differences in dietary consumption were observed in different populations. The current study aimed to identify sociodemographic and lifestyle determinants of diet quality and to investigate the differences in diet quality between the three main language regions of Switzerland. Using data of the Swiss National Nutrition Survey menuCH (n = ), two diet quality scores-Alternate Healthy Eating Index and Mediterranean Diet Score-were computed. Linear regression models were used to investigate the determinants of diet quality and chi-square tests were used to test for differences in single score components between language regions. Significantly higher diet quality scores were observed for individuals who were female, older, normal weight, non-Swiss, with tertiary education or moderate-to-high physical activity level. Additionally, residents of the French- and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland scored higher than residents of the German-speaking region. More specifically, the higher diet quality observed in the French- and Italian-speaking regions was mediated by higher scores in the components of alcohol, dairy products, fat, fish, sugar-sweetened beverages and whole grains. The present results may help to better characterize population groups requiring specific dietary recommendations, enabling public health authorities to develop targeted interventions.","doc_id":6457,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"100","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22836","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Smart services summit : digital as an enabler for smart service business development","authors":"West, Shaun; Meierhofer, Jürg; Ganz, Christopher","subject":"Smart services; Service ecosystems; Value creation; Data science;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Konferenz: Proceedings","bid":"005","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Smart services summit : digital as an enabler for smart service business development; Smart services; Service ecosystems; Value creation; Data science;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; This book offers state-of-the-art descriptions of intelligent service innovations in industry, supported by novel scientific approaches.

In case of explosions, e.g. due to technical failures in an oil- and gas refinery, the safety valve should close in milliseconds with the incident shock wave and substantially reduce the blast-pressure leakage into the building. On the other hand, the safety valve should exhibit a low pressure drop in normal operation in order to reduce the power consumption of the ventilators. One main difficulty in the design of such safety valves is to meet the minimum technical requirements, while ensuring the functionality in intrinsically different operating modes. Therefore, the present study proposes a target-oriented evaluation and optimization procedure for such devices, incorporating comprehensive numerical and experimental investigations. CFD, FEM and FSI analyses are regarded as an appropriate approach to predict valve performance parameters and to gain additional insights into the flow or structural behavior of the safety valve, which serves then as a basis for geometrical optimizations. The introduced procedure is exemplified on an existing passive air blast safety valve as a case study. The performance of the new design is significantly increased in ventilation operation, while meeting the performance criteria in the stress case when subjected to blast loads.","doc_id":6488,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6828","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The targeting of Lamp1 to lysosomes is dependent on the spacing of its cytoplasmic tail tyrosine sorting motif relative to the membrane","authors":"Rohrer, Jack; Schweizer, Anja; Russel, David; Kornfeld, Stuart","subject":" Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"1996","for_data_analysis":"The targeting of Lamp to lysosomes is dependent on the spacing of its cytoplasmic tail tyrosine sorting motif relative to the membrane;  Biochemie; Lamp is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is localized primarily in lysosomes and late endosomes. Newly synthesized molecules are mostly transported from the trans-Golgi network directly to endosomes and then to lysosomes. A minor pathway involves transport via the plasma membrane. The -amino acid cytoplasmic tail of lamp contains a tyrosine-based motif that has been previously shown to mediate sorting in the trans-Golgi network and rapid internalization at the plasma membrane. We studied whether this motif also mediates sorting in endosomes. We found that mutant forms of lamp in which all the amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail were modified except for the RKR membrane anchor and the YXXI sorting motif still localized to dense lysosomes, indicating that the YXXI motif is sufficient to confer proper intracellular targeting. However, when the spacing of the YXXI motif relative to the membrane was changed by deleting one amino acid or adding five amino acids, lysosomal targeting was almost completely abolished. Kinetic studies showed that these mutants were trapped in a recycling pathway, involving trafficking between the plasma membrane and early endocytic compartments. These findings indicate that the YXXI signal of lamp is recognized at several sorting sites, including the trans-Golgi network, the plasma membrane, and the early/sorting endosomes. Small changes in the spacing of this motif relative to the membrane dramatically impair sorting in the early/sorting endosomes but have only a modest effect on internalization at the plasma membrane. The spacing of sorting signals relative to the membrane may prove to be an important determinant in the functioning of these signals.","doc_id":6509,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1475","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Data visualization in online journalism and its implications for the production process","authors":"Weber, Wibke; Rall, Hans-Martin","subject":" Nachrichtenmedien, Journalismus und Verlagswesen","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"070","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Data visualization in online journalism and its implications for the production process;  Nachrichtenmedien, Journalismus und Verlagswesen","doc_id":6601,"prior":"production process","sdg12":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20527","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Evaluation of the effect of a novel membrane filtration system on the life span of frying oil","authors":"Geiger, Philippe; Buchli, Jürg; Rüegg, Ramona; Müller, Nadina","subject":"Membrane filtration; Deep frying; Used frying oil; Oil stability; Membrane processing;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"664","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Evaluation of the effect of a novel membrane filtration system on the life span of frying oil; Membrane filtration; Deep frying; Used frying oil; Oil stability; Membrane processing;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; Frying oil has a limited lifetime which results in the disposal of approximately % of all used oil.

Das schweizerische Elektrizitätsversorgungssystem besteht mehrheitlich aus Grosskraftwerken (Wasserkraft %, Kernenergie %). Die auf diese Weise zentral erzeugte Energie wird über das Übertragungsnetz (Netzebene ) zu den Verbraucherzentren transportiert. Alsdann wird der Strom auf eine niedrigere Spannung transformiert und über die Netzebenen –, das Verteilnetz, regional und lokal letztlich an die Endverbraucher verteilt. In diesem System hat das Übertragungsnetz für den notwendigen Ausgleich von Produktion und Verbrauch zu sorgen. Im europäischen Strombinnenmarkt kommen dem Übertragungsnetz sodann noch weitere Funktionen zu. Der mit der -Säulen-Energiepolitik des Bundesrates seit  eingeleitete und mit der Energiestrategie  weiter konkretisierte und akzentuierte Umbau der Energieversorgung mit einem Ausbau der (neuen) Erneuerbaren Energien und dem Ziel eines möglichen Ausstiegs aus der Kernenergie führt zu einer zunehmenden dezentralen Produktion mit Einspeisung auf den unteren Netzebenen. Dies stellt die Netze vor neue Herausforderungen und verlangt eine enge Abstimmung zwischen Übertragungs- und Verteilnetzen. Den Netzen kommt demnach auf dieser «Grossbaustelle» eine zentrale Rolle zu. Sie müssen fit gemacht werden für die Überlastungs- und Spannungshaltungsprobleme, welche sich aus der dezentralen Einspeisung aus Quellen, die dargebotsabhängig (d.h. nicht steuerbar) und in einem mitteleuropäischen Land wie der Schweiz stark fluktuierend sind, ergeben. Unabdingbar bleiben in diesem System Grosskraftwerke, mit welchen die durch die oft nur schwer antizipierbare und bisher kaum steuerbare Einspeisung aus erneuerbaren Energiequellen entstehende Über- oder Unterproduktion im System rasch ausgeregelt werden kann. Auch für die vorhandenen Kraftwerke ergeben sich deshalb neue Herausforderungen, die es zu meistern gilt. Um diese Herausforderungen meistern zu können, soll das System noch intelligenter gemacht werden, als es bisher schon ist. Der Netzausbau wird damit zum Netzumbau im Sinne eines verstärkten Einsatzes von Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien, mit dem Ziel eines Smart Grid mit neuen Funktionalitäten. Gemäss der deutschen Bundesnetzagentur (BnetzA) bedeutet ‹smart› «[i]m Ergebnis [...], dass Netzzustände in ‹Echtzeit› erfasst werden können und Möglichkeiten zur Steuerung und Regelung der Netze bestehen, sodass die bestehende Netzkapazität tatsächlich voll genutzt werden kann». Es wird somit zu einer verstärkten Verflechtung des Energieversorgungssystems mit der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie kommen. Visionäre wie Rifkin sprechen deshalb bereits von einem «Energy Internet» und einer Konvergenz der Netze zu einem globalen «Internet of Things». Im Rahmen des vorliegenden Beitrags beschränke ich mich auf ein paar eher nüchterne Überlegungen zu Smart Grids aus regulatorischer Sicht.","doc_id":6705,"prior":"Verbrauch","sdg12":1},{"id":"60","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11100","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Integration of FM and asset management expertise in digital 3D building models","authors":"Ashworth, Simon; Druhmann, Carsten K.","subject":"Building Information Modelling); Facility Management; 3D laser scanning;  Facility Management;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.2, 690","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Integration of FM and asset management expertise in digital D building models; Building Information Modelling); Facility Management; D laser scanning;  Facility Management;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk; Purpose: The research establishes a Conceptual Process Model (CPM) as shown in Figure  which shows how Facility Management (FM) and Asset Management (AM) know-how, D laser scanning and Building Information Modelling (BIM) can be combined with virtual design and simulation techniques to help managers make better decisions about feasibility report options and to add value and optimize existing buildings performance and quality.Design methodology and approach: Mixed methods were used including a review of BIM literature and industry best practice. Seven semi-structured interviews were held with stakeholders from different stages in the BIM process.

Many years of research appear to have produced only limited data on the effects of VR technology on children’s learning success. It is assumed that VR supports the learning theory of constructivism because it allows immersion, interaction, D representation, and adoption of multiple perspectives. To investigate the topic, a prototype has been developed for a “Nature and Technology” learning unit on the subject of plastics and their effects on the environment. Divided into five learning blocks, the learning unit provides students with knowledge about the composition, production, and recycling of plastics. In addition, it explores the related environmental consequences and possible solution strategies. Ideas for possible VR applications were developed for each of these blocks. This vision was discussed in four interviews with teachers. The resulting VR application was commented on and evaluated by  students of the same class. In a second phase, the teaching unit incorporating VR was compared to a conventional unit by means of a field experiment and two random sample tests measuring impact on the learning success of  students. Their learning success was not found to have improved significantly.","doc_id":6863,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18510","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Betriebswirtschaft verstehen : das St. Galler Management-Modell","authors":"Capaul, Roman; Steingruber, Daniel","subject":" Management","type":"Buch","bid":"650","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Betriebswirtschaft verstehen : das St. Galler Management-Modell;  Management; Um komplexe Funktionsweisen von verschiedenen Menschen in ihren Funktionen und Strukturen im Unternehmen besser zu verstehen, sind Modelle hilfreich.

There is a plethora of waste and by-products that remain unused in the traditional linear industrial system. However, transformation from a linear to a circular system is challenging, limited by several constraints such as the availability of information on the specific composition of the waste, the availability in time and space, the quantity of waste, as well as limited knowledge of the usability of such waste products. These challenges are exacerbated by the initial effort needed for implementation before an economy benefits from economic, ecological or societal improvements. Nevertheless, a circular economy generates less waste and consumes fewer resources, which in return makes it more profitable due to cost savings enabled by efficient resource use. The goal of the SHAREBOX project is the development of a platform for the facilitation of synergies within the industry to enable a more circular flow of resources within the European process industries. The project consortium has  partners including research organisations, SMEs and industrial partners as well as market actors and is part of the EU framework program Horizon . Materials and Methods: The SHAREBOX platform is a database of available waste and resources required by companies, enabling the transformation of waste to resources by matching of two demands. The platform also serves as the first point of contact between different partners in a circular system. Furthermore, the platform enables the identification of new synergies overarching the different subsectors of the industries as well as optimal matching from the perspective of a circular economy. The key objectives are the facilitation of circular synergies through information and communications technology, the provision of information required to realise circular synergies within European industries and the identification of new circular synergies. Results and Discussion: The results of circular industry systems facilitated by the National Industrial Symbiosis Program (NISP) in the United Kingdom show a substantial reduction in the consumption of resources and generation of emissions compared to linear systems. Nevertheless, if there is a plethora of different types of waste, there is also a plethora of different synergies. This leads to different results for each type of waste that is transformed to a resource. Furthermore, the life cycle stage of transformation also has to be included. A transformation such as the reuse of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can lead to emissions or require additional auxiliary materials as well as transportation. Therefore, the potential benefit will never be equal to the total impact of the primary input because of the transformation stage and the associated environmental impacts of collection and beneficiation. We analysed the implications of the transformation of different waste types to resources when industries are located in different geographic locations under consideration of the life cycle stage of transformation. Figure  shows the most significant results of the net benefit within the set of analysed waste types: the transformation of PET and concrete waste. Waste PET can be transported up to   km by lorry and still provide a net benefit regarding greenhouse gas emissions due to circular use. However, in case of concrete, the results are very different. A net benefit only occurs if the additional transport distance compared to primary concrete is less than  km. As a reference, the median of the transported distance of completed transformations within the NISP in the United Kingdom according to Jensen et al. is indicated with a black cross. About half of the  transformations within NISP were realised within a radius of  km and only one quarter of the synergies involved distances greater than  km. Conclusions: Transformation from linear to circular systems can substantially reduce total resource consumption as well as emissions of the whole value chain and therefore contribute to a greener economy. However, matching industries for transformations leading to the substitution of primary materials is still a major challenge. In addition, the environmental benefits of the reuse of resources is limited by the life cycle stage of the transformation as well as by additional transportation that may be required. The analysed set of types of waste shows a broad range of potential benefits. For some types of waste, the net benefits are still considerable after the subtraction of the additional impacts due to the life cycle stage of transformation as well as additional transport requirements.

In addition, the environmental benefits of the reuse of resources is limited by the life cycle stage of the transformation as well as by additional transportation that may be required. The analysed set of types of waste shows a broad range of potential benefits. For some types of waste, the net benefits are still considerable after the subtraction of the additional impacts due to the life cycle stage of transformation as well as additional transport requirements. However, for selected types of waste, the net benefit tends to be negligible. The completeness of the scope will be crucial for the assessment and generalisations overarching different types of waste remain challenging.","doc_id":7025,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23726","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Climbing ropes : environmental hotspots in their life cycle and potentials for optimization","authors":"Bradford, Sebastian; Rupf, Reto; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Climbing rope; Polyamide; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Product development; Outdoor activities; Mountaineering; User behaviour; Greenhouse gas emissions;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"338.927","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Climbing ropes : environmental hotspots in their life cycle and potentials for optimization; Climbing rope; Polyamide; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Product development; Outdoor activities; Mountaineering; User behaviour; Greenhouse gas emissions;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Mountain sports are affected by climate change in a way which few other sports are.

This is particularly true for older buildings, whose energy consumption could be significantly reduced by energetic renovation. The present study asked about (communicative) challenges and barriers of private house owners, as well as communication needs and wishes when planning and carrying out renovations. For this purpose, partially standardized interviews were conducted with service providers in the field of renovations, moreover data was collected within the framework of standardised interviews and a focus group with homeowners from the area of Winterthur. The study shows that private homeowners principally are open-minded to implement sustainable renovation solutions. However, they feel overwhelmed by the information on offer insofar as they partly do not trust the sources and the information focus very one-sidedly on technical, financial and ecological aspects. Communication oriented to the needs of homeowners should offer much greater assistance in assessing the scope and time horizon of the various refurbishment areas of certain building types (building fabric, year of construction, etc.) on the one hand, and in being able to include the specific life situation in the decision-making process on the other. In addition, more attention should be paid to the development and expansion of help desks and platforms that not only enable a holistic view of renovations, but also provide access to trustworthy and proven providers as well as an exchange of information and experience among homeowners who want to deal with renovation issues.","doc_id":7121,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9862","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Das patentrechtliche Erschöpfungsregime in Art. 9a PatG und Art. 27b LwG","authors":"Zuberbühler, Ivo","subject":" Privatrecht (CH)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"346","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Das patentrechtliche Erschöpfungsregime in Art. a PatG und Art. b LwG;  Privatrecht (CH); Parallelimporte patentgeschützter Waren konnten bis zum Inkrafttreten von Art. b LwG und Art. a PatG gestützt auf die bloss national erschöpften Vertriebsrechte des Patentinhabers untersagt werden.

In particular, the importance of soy as an element in feedstuff is examined in depth.The analysis is centred around the misleading statement that % of the feedstuff in Switzerland comes from ‘native meadows and fields’. This percentage is based on the combination of roughage and concentrated feed, two categories of feedstuff that must not be added because they have limited substitutability and are therefore not directly comparable. Roughage is eaten mainly by ruminants. Meat, however, comes primarily from pigs and poultry which are both dependent on concentrated feed. Roughage is almost % domestically sourced, while more than % of concentrated feed comes from abroad. Protein is particularly scarce: around % of the protein in concentrated feed comes from imports (mainly soy).Therefore, if today’s feedstuff were not imported, livestock populations would decline significantly, particularly those that are dependent on concentrated feed. According to model calculations, it would be possible to keep % of sheep and goats, % of cattle, % of pigs and % of poultry on the basis of domestic feed alone. At  kg per capita per year, meat production would be halved in comparison to the present day. Pork would remain the most important type of meat, although it would be over % less compared to today. Poultry meat would virtually disappear. However, around  kg of milk could still be produced per capita annually.Swiss agriculture specialises in the production of livestock. About % of agricultural land is used for animal feed, in addition to the at least , hectares of arable areas abroad which are used for the cultivation of animal feedstuff for the Swiss market. Soybeans, wheat, corn, etc. grow on these areas.Since the mid-s, the importing of feedstuff has increased sharply, most of which is imported from Europe. The most important protein feed which is imported is soy, which, due to public criticism, now tends to increasingly come from Europe. Most of the imported feedstuffs are in direct competition with human foods. This is because they come from crops that we humans can eat directly, including not only all cereals such as wheat, corn, rice, oats and barley, but also soybeans.In intensive livestock farming, the calorie content present in plant-based foods that we humans are able eat directly is converted into a lot less in animal food products. In this process, the production of meat ‘destroys’ significantly more plant-derived calories than that of milk. This is because milk still contains a lot of grass that only cows and other ruminants can digest.Soy is the world's most important animal protein feedstuff. Originally, soybeans were cultivated in Asia for human consumption. Today, about % of global production is used to feed livestock, more than half of which is used for chicken fattening. While poultry consume by far the most soy protein feed on a global scale, in Switzerland it is cattle which rank first in this regard. This is the result of the central importance of milk production and the breeding of performance breeds that depend on protein-rich concentrated feed.Global soy production has grown steadily in recent years, and in Brazil even exponentially. Approximately half of all soy is used for feeding or consumption purposes in growing countries, while the other half is traded internationally. The main producing and exporting countries are the U.S. and Brazil while the main importing countries are China and the EU.Brazil is still the most important source region for Swiss soybean imports. The country grows soybeans for the global market: around % of production is exported. Only % of Brazil's farms cultivate soybeans and only % of soybean farms are family-owned. In the past  years production has expanded, especially in the ecologically valuable Cerrado and Amazon biomes. There, the average soybean acreage is  ha (Amazonas) and  ha (Cerrado).The supply chains for soy imported into Switzerland are not transparent. The description ‘responsibly produced’ glosses over soy production in Brazil and the soy trade. According to research, Swiss soy imports from Brazil come from specialised, large-scale farms with intensive soy cultivation, monotonous crop rotations and high pesticide use. Most of these farms are located in the state of Mato Grosso, i.e. in the Cerrado or Amazon biome, where most land has been cleared in recent decades.ProTerra-certified soy also comes from original rainforest (Amazon) or savanna (Cerrado) areas. ‘Zero deforestation’ refers only to the last decade.Animal food products constitutes a billion-dollar business in Switzerland. The supply chains show a high market concentration in inputs (feedstuff), in processing (meat, dairy milk) and in wholesale and retail trade. A few companies, especially the conglomerates Coop, Migros and fenaco, dominate the markets. The industrialisation of production in efficient international supply chains is most advanced in the production of eggs and chicken. Here, too, the supply chains are not very transparent.According to model calculations, more than % of the total greenhouse gas emissions due to Swiss agriculture are directly attributable to livestock farming, % to the rest of agriculture and about % occur in the countries where animal feedstuff is grown. If feedstuff were not imported, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by %. The nitrogen surpluses in Swiss agriculture are also largely a result of livestock farming. More than % of the surpluses occur in Switzerland. Without feedstuff imports, the nitrogen surpluses in Switzerland would be reduced by %.The results of the research and model calculations thus lead to five conclusions:I.\tThe industry's advertising images and messages are misleading and gloss over livestock farming in Switzerland and its dependence on imports. They shape the perceptions of the population and increase the demand for animal food products \"from Switzerland\".II.\tGovernmental agencies do little to educate the population about Swiss livestock farming. They support the misleading images and messages through official terminology and reporting. Political interests favour production and sales interests over the many other societal concerns (e.g. health, environment, animal welfare, transparency, economic costs, reliability of supply).III.\tIt is not Swiss agriculture that benefits most from fedstuff imports. This is because agriculture does not depend solely on production for its income; it receives income-securing direct payments. Rather, imports are in the interest of upstream and downstream industries. They are the ones who mainly benefit from a high rate of livestock farming at discounted prices.IV.\tSwiss chicken production is a clear example: the doubling of production in the last  years has benefited a few upstream and downstream companies, a handful of global breeding companies and only a very small proportion of farms. The expansion of chicken fattening is a questionable development in Swiss livestock farming. It is further encouraged by the current debate concerning the environment and the climate as chicken is considered resource-efficient and ‘climate friendly’.V.\tAs a guiding principle for the future, it is proposed that Swiss livestock farming be adapted to the local ecosystem boundaries in Switzerland, and that the consumption by the Swiss population be adapted to global ecosystem boundaries. This would mean being able to halve meat consumption at the very least.","doc_id":7260,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21566","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Extending the lifetime of mobile devices to reduce their environmental impact : a glimpse on the project LIFESAVING","authors":"Jobin, Marilou; Külling, Céline; Jattke, Marleen; Blumer, Yann","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"363","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Extending the lifetime of mobile devices to reduce their environmental impact : a glimpse on the project LIFESAVING;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Mobile Internet-enabled devices (MIEDs) such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets have become a crucial part of our lives.

Especially processed foods are in focus. And it is particularly critical when foods perceived as healthy (e.g. breakfast cereals or yogurt) contain a lot of sugar.  In this research project, various (technology and recipe based) possibilities for reducing added sugar in breakfast cereals were investigated. The aim was to ensure that consumers perceive the sugar-reduced products as \"equally sweet\" compared to those without sugar reduction. For three different categories of breakfast cereals (crunchy, flakes and puffs) and three different tastes each (plain, fruit, chocolate), sugar-reduced variants were developed. Different strategies were explored to reduce added sugar, for example, the use of flavourings, the use of a binder based on soluble fibres or the generation of sensory contrasts. To confirm the \"silent\" reduction of sugar in the resulting prototypes, sensory tests (A / not-A tests, ISO ) were carried out in different target groups (regarding gender, age groups, consumption habits).Results of the study show in general, that the use of a binder based on soluble fibres is best suited for sugar reduction in crunchy mueslis. A reduction of up to % added sugar can be achieved. For flakes, a reduction of up to % sugar can be achieved using the \"sensory contrast\" approach. And with the \"flavourings\" approach, the added sugar in puffs can also be reduced by up to % within one adjustment step.A substantial reduction of added sugar without changing the sensory properties is an incredibly challenging task - no matter what kind of food. Only relatively small reduction steps are possible without sensory impairments.It is therefore recommended to combine different approaches and to choose small to medium reduction steps in order to maintain consumer acceptance.","doc_id":7294,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"34","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7317","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Unprecedented sensitivity of the planar yeast estrogen screen by using a spray-on technology","authors":"Schönborn, Andreas; Schmid, Pascal; Bräm, Sarah; Reifferscheid, Georg; Ohlig, Marina; Buchinger, Sebastian","subject":"Planar-YES; Estrogenic compound; HPTLC; Hyphenation; Spray-on procedure; Sensitivity;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Unprecedented sensitivity of the planar yeast estrogen screen by using a spray-on technology; Planar-YES; Estrogenic compound; HPTLC; Hyphenation; Spray-on procedure; Sensitivity;  Biochemie; The planar yeast estrogen screen (p-YES) can serve as a highly valuable and sensitive screening tool for the detection of estrogenic compounds in various sample matrices such as water and wastewater, personal care products and foodstuff. The method combines the separation of sample constituents by thin layer chromatography with the direct detection of estrogenic compounds on the surface of the HPTLC-plate. The previous protocol using the immersion of a normal phase silica HPTLC-plate in a cell suspension for bio-autography resulted in blurred signals due to the accelerated diffusion of compounds on the wet surface of the HPTLC-plate. Here, the application of the yeast cells by spraying on the surface of the HPTLC-plate is described as an alternative approach. The presented method for the hyphenation of normal phase thin layer chromatography with a yeast estrogen screen results in much sharper signals compared to reports in previous publications. Satisfying results were achieved using cultures with cell densities of  FAU. Due to the reduced signal broadening, lower limits of quantification for estrogenic compounds were achieved (Estrone (E) =  pg/zone, β-estradiol (E) = . pg/zone, α-ethinylestradiol (EE) = . pg/zone and Estriol (E) =  pg/zone). As demonstrated, it is possible to characterize profiles of estrogenic activity of wastewater samples with high quality and reproducibility. The improved sensitivity opens the stage for applications using native samples from waste- or even surface water directly applied on HPTLC-plates without the need for prior sample treatment by e.g. solid phase extraction.","doc_id":7364,"prior":"wastewater","sdg12":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21480","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"How sport sponsorships affect motivation for sport consumption : the role of perceived brand sincerity","authors":"Reimann, Olivier; Thomas, Oliver; Kucza, Gunther; Schuppisser, Stefan","subject":" Freizeit und Tourismus;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"306.48, 658.8","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"How sport sponsorships affect motivation for sport consumption : the role of perceived brand sincerity;  Freizeit und Tourismus;  Marketingmanagement","doc_id":7379,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"93","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12447","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Killer Features für eine App für Pflegebedürftige und deren Angehörige finden","authors":"Waldvogel, Silvan","subject":" Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Soziale Gruppen","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"005, 305","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Killer Features für eine App für Pflegebedürftige und deren Angehörige finden;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Soziale Gruppen; Die Überalterung der Bevölkerung übt Druck auf die Sozial- und Gesundheitssysteme aus und führt zu einer geringeren Verfügbarkeit von Pflegepersonal.

With telecom operator’s desire to capitalize on cloud computing by using their vast amount of infrastructure, the need for a RCB solution that serves the needs of cloudified telcos is needed.In this paper we present an approach to implement a generic rating, charging, and billing engine that serves the business and technical needs of both cloudified telecom services and those of cloud service providers. Key to this is a generic accounting process to drive the design of the generic RCB architecture. We show how RCB as a service can be offered catering to not only traditional telco services, the new cloud services they wish and will offer, but packaged cloudified services to the consumers and application developers as well. Finally, we detail how our architecture can be distributed and key services replicated to ensure high-availability.The end result of this paper is a solution that can enable telecom service providers to leverage the rapidly growing and accelerating cloud service market.","doc_id":7550,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17329","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"We don't need no statusfaction?!","authors":"Hari, Jürg J.; Rawitzer, Heike","subject":"Status; Satisfaction; Marketing Conference; Statusfaction;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.8","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"We don't need no statusfaction?!; Status; Satisfaction; Marketing Conference; Statusfaction;  Marketingmanagement; Non-conscious, automatic and unobserved processes in memory have a high impact in the field of the status and conspicuous consumption, especially in the prestige-seeking consumer behaviour.

Hence, the primary objective was to implement an empirical assessment methodology, including the “Sustainability Code” that was composed of four parts and a “Sustainability Load Index”. During the spring semester ,  different experimental projects were performed in the ICBC’s analytical chemistry practical course. These were carried out on  different instrumental workspaces, encompassing  different analytical methodologies. For the development of the first and second parts of the Sustainability Code, information concerning the chemical substances (in any state- solid, liquid or gas) used and the energy consumption of the apparatus was recorded. The third and fourth parts contain (approximate) information on the use of consumables and the sustainability of the method with reference to the apparatus used. The Load Index (LI) consists of an aggregation (summary) of the direct causality indicators ‘substances’ and ‘energy’ into a single figure. The experiments were classified on a -level Load Index Scale into ‘ideal’ analysis methods (LI> ), ‘sustainable’ methods of analysis (LI -), and analysis methods ‘with potential for optimization’ (LI <). The assessment criteria described here, specifically designed for an analytical process in a university environment, may also serve as a useful guide for semi-quantitative assessment of both familiar and new methods in analytical chemistry practical courses and in laboratory practice. It may also be useful in general research laboratory environments.","doc_id":7603,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"33","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15661","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Digital product innovation in manufacturing industries : towards a taxonomy for feedback-driven product development scenarios","authors":"Holler, Manuel; Neiditsch, Gerard; Uebernickel, Falk; Brenner, Walter","subject":"Digital product innovation; Manufacturing industrie; Product development;  Produktionssteuerung","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.5","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Digital product innovation in manufacturing industries : towards a taxonomy for feedback-driven product development scenarios; Digital product innovation; Manufacturing industrie; Product development;  Produktionssteuerung; In the light of pervasive digitalization, traditional physical products get augmented with digital components that create the potential of making the whole product lifecycle visible for product developers.

Energieeffizienz bedarf dabei nebst technischer Lösungen auch Ansätzen zur Verhaltensänderung. Anreize sind eine Möglichkeit für EVU, ihre Kundschaft zum Energiesparen zu motivieren. Im Projekt wird erforscht, ob unkonventionelle nicht-monetäre Anreize besonders geeignet sind, Haushalte zum Stromsparen zu bewegen. Dazu wurden im ersten Schritt qualitative Experteninterviews mit Vertretern von Energieunternehmen durchgeführt, um realitätsnahe Anreize zu identifizieren. Anschliessend prüften wir diese Anreize in zwei Online-Experimente (N =  und N = ) auf ihre Wirkung auf die Stromsparabsicht - sowohl allgemein wie auch für spezifische Verbrauchergruppen. Im ersten Experiment zeigte sich, dass Gebühren auf niedrige Akzeptanz trafen. Des Weiteren war die Energiespar-Absicht bei monetären und unkonventionellen Belohnungen nicht höher als bei blosser Aufforderung zum Energiesparen. Verschiedene sozioökonomische Gruppen reagierten gleich auf die Anreize. Jedoch reagierten Gruppen mit hohem Umweltbewusstsein besonders positiv auf Belohnungssysteme und Energiespar-Aufforderungen ohne Anreiz. Im zweiten Experiment wurde die Wirkung monetärer Anreize mit der Wirkung einer Auswahl von unkonventionellen Anreizen verglichen. Eine Auswahl zwischen Gutscheinen für alltägliche Dienstleistungen (z.B. öffentliche Verkehrsmittel, Lebensmittelgeschäfte) motivierte die Teilnehmenden am stärksten, Strom zu sparen. Verschiedene Belohnungen und die Aufforderung zum Energiesparen wirkten gleichermassen positiv auf die Loyalität der Verbrauchenden zum Energieunternehmen. Insgesamt schnitten bei Haushalten mit geringem Interesse an Energie-Themen unkonventionelle Anreize nicht besser ab als andere Anreizsysteme. Beide Experimente zeigten jedoch, dass Verbrauchende die Förderung von Energiesparverhalten durch EVU als positiv wahrnehmen. Auch zeigte sich, dass sie Interesse daran haben, mehr über ihren eigenen Energieverbrauch zu erfahren. Das Projekt bietet eine Grundlage, um verschiedene Ansätze der Sensibilisierung zum Energiesparen in der Realität anzuwenden und weiterzuentwickeln.; Demand-side management is becoming more relevant for energy utilities to reach the goals of the Swiss Energy Strategy . Besides technical approaches to increase energy efficiency, approaches for behavioural change are also necessary. Here, energy utilities may use incentives to engage the public and their customers, in particular. The key idea of this project is to examine if unconventional non-monetary incentives are particularly successful in engaging households to save electricity through behavioural change. Therefore, we first conducted a series of qualitative expert interviews with representatives of energy utilities to identify suitable incentives. Subsequently, we conducted two large-scale online experiments (N =  and ,) to examine which incentive schemes are most effective in general, and for certain consumer groups. The first experiment revealed that fees receive low acceptance and energy-saving intentions were not higher when monetary or unconventional rewards were offered compared to a condition without incentives. Moreover, disparate socio-economic groups did not differ in their intention to change their behaviour for various incentives, in contrast to groups varying in their awareness of energy issues. The second experiment offered participants a choice of incentives. Here, a choice among coupons that can be used on a day-to-day basis (e.g. coupons for public transport and supermarkets) most motivated participants to change their behaviour. As in the first experiment, we found no alterations among socio-economic groups; incentives did not have a differing effect on participants’ customer loyalty to the energy utility. Taken together, both experiments suggest that unconventional incentives are not more successful compared to other types of incentives to engage customers that, thus far, have been uninterested in energy issues. However, both experiments suggest that energy utilities’ promotion of energy saving through behavioural change was highly welcomed by participants in general. In addition, both experiments suggest that participants are keen to learn about their own energy consumption. Hence, the project provides a rich basis for starting a real-world field trial to further explore the energy-saving potential of different types of incentives.","doc_id":7867,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24193","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Sharing Economy : unter welchen Bedingungen Leute mitziehen","authors":"Burkhalter, Linda","subject":"Kreislaufwirtschaft; Psychologie; Psychologischer Besitz; Sharing; Konsumentenverhalten;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Sharing Economy : unter welchen Bedingungen Leute mitziehen; Kreislaufwirtschaft; Psychologie; Psychologischer Besitz; Sharing; Konsumentenverhalten;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","doc_id":7870,"prior":"Sharing Economy","sdg12":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24193","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Sharing Economy : unter welchen Bedingungen Leute mitziehen","authors":"Burkhalter, Linda","subject":"Kreislaufwirtschaft; Psychologie; Psychologischer Besitz; Sharing; Konsumentenverhalten;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Sharing Economy : unter welchen Bedingungen Leute mitziehen; Kreislaufwirtschaft; Psychologie; Psychologischer Besitz; Sharing; Konsumentenverhalten;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","doc_id":7870,"prior":"Kreislaufwirtschaft","sdg12":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8938","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A cost estimation for CO2 reduction and reuse by methanation from cement industry sources in Switzerland","authors":"Baier, Jens; Schneider, Gabriel; Heel, Andre","subject":"CO2 methanation; Power to gas; Switzerland; cement-based CO2; Hydrogen; Photovoltaics; Electrolysis;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338.927, 620","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"A cost estimation for CO reduction and reuse by methanation from cement industry sources in Switzerland; CO methanation; Power to gas; Switzerland; cement-based CO; Hydrogen; Photovoltaics; Electrolysis;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Ingenieurwesen; The Swiss government has signed the Paris Climate Agreement and various measures need to be implemented in order to reach the target of a % reduction in CO emissions in Switzerland by  compared with the value for .

Durch diese sind Konsumenten in der Lage, Unterhaltungsprogramme selbstbestimmt und flexibel aufzurufen. Weil die Beliebtheit von SVoD-Diensten auch hierzulande bemerkbar ist, müssen Schweizer Fernsehsender auf die Veränderungen reagieren. Die Bachelorarbeit untersucht zwei Perspektiven bezüglich dieser Problemstellung: diejenige der Fernsehsender und die der Konsumenten. Seitens der Fernsehsender eruiert man, welchen Einfluss die Digitalisierung auf die Wertkette der Fernsehsender hat. Man bringt weiter in Erfahrung, wie Fernsehsender durch SVoD-Dienste geprägt werden, welche Stärken und Schwächen sie aufweisen und wie sie sich weiterentwickeln können. Aus der Perspektive der Konsumenten setzt man sich damit auseinander, wie Unterhaltung heutzutage konsumiert wird und welchen Einfluss die SVoD-Dienste auf das Konsumverhalten ausüben. Innerhalb der Theorie diskutiert man die Wertkette der Fernsehsender und Trends innerhalb der Digitalisierung. Ausserdem stehen die Disruption in Folge der SVoD-Geschäftsmodelle sowie das Konsumentenverhalten im Fokus. Diese theoretischen Konzepte dienten als Grundlage für die Primärforschung, die sowohl qualitativ in Form von Experteninterviews als auch quantitativ mittels Konsumentenbefragung erfolgte. Die Wertkette hat sich aufgrund der Digitalisierung gewandelt in Bezug auf: Produktion, Marketing und Vertrieb sowie Quote. Auch zeigt sich, dass SVoD-Anbieter hierzulande die Fernsehbranche im Segment Unterhaltung bedrohen. Die Stärken der Fernsehsender zeigen sich in der Produktion von Live-Inhalten und lokalen Formaten. Schwächen sind die finanziellen Ressourcen in der Produktion, der lineare Vertrieb und die eingeschränkte Verfügbarkeit von Inhalten. Fernsehsender werden künftig vermehrt auf Multi-Plattform-Strategien setzen, bei welchen der lineare Vertrieb durch zusätzliche Online-Angebote ergänzt wird. Seitens Konsumenten kann man aufzeigen, dass sie weniger nach vorgegebenen Zeitplänen konsumieren, sie auch abseits des Fernsehgeräts rezipieren und sie sich vermehrt ihr eigenes Programm aus verschiedenen Anbietern selbst zusammenstellen. Der Konsum erfolgt zudem zunehmend individualisiert und personalisiert. Weiter zeigt sich, dass SVoD-Dienste besonders auf jüngere Generationen Einfluss haben: Erstens betreiben jüngere Menschen vermehrt „Binge Watching“, zweitens reduziert man ihretwegen zunehmend die Nutzung von Fernsehsendern. Man kann resümieren, dass eine Koexistenz von Fernsehsendern und SVoD-Anbietern möglich ist. Dafür müssen sich Fernsehsender jedoch von SVoD-Diensten differenzieren und sicherstellen, dass man neue Vertriebsmodelle aufbaut, welche dem heutigen Nutzerverhalten entsprechen. Weitere Untersuchungen können sich auf die konkrete Ausgestaltung neuer Geschäftsmodelle von Fernsehsendern fokussieren. Da zunehmend neue SVoD-Anbieter entstehen, kann man ausserdem eine Untersuchung des Wettbewerbs zwischen diesen Anbietern durchführen.","doc_id":7971,"prior":"Konsumverhalten","sdg12":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1824","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Advanced control of energy storage systems for PV installation maximizing self-consumption","authors":"Segundo Sevilla, Felix Rafael; Knazkins, Valerijs; Park, Chan; Korba, Petr","subject":"IEFE;  Energietechnik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"621.04, 621.3","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Advanced control of energy storage systems for PV installation maximizing self-consumption; IEFE;  Energietechnik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; In this work, a new framework for control of power flow of an energy storage is proposed.

Carbon dioxide (CO) is the main by-product in exhaust plumes. Although it does not have any health effect, it is well-known its influence on the climate warming, in addition, the fluid-dynamics behaviour of CO is representative for any gas pollutant in the plume. The main pollutants are waste products of the industrial activity or the combustion processes, mainly carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen and sulfur oxides (NOx, SOx) in gas phase and solid particulate matter.In the present work, we have made a comprehensive study of the effect that CO plumes from the harbour of Tromsø (Norway) have in the contamination levels in the city. We have used computational fluid dynamics modelling of CO transport and diffusion in air. OpenFOAM® has been used for the simulation of the gas mixture. The Navier-Stokes equation has been solved including compressibility effects of perfect gases and buoyancy effects. Turbulence effects have been treated within the k- model of the Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The simulation workflow has been improved by developing a steady-state solver that overcomes the inefficiency of the transient calculation when it comes to calculate long time effects. The effects of solid pollutants will be addressed using a Lagrangian solver to describe the transport within the plume.The influence of the wind speed and direction, as well as, the height of the chimneys in the distribution of CO and pollutants has been studied comprehensively. The parameter studies have been run in the online platform KALEIDOSIM®. The presented results will help to evaluate the impact of the CO emissions in the everyday life of local citizens.","doc_id":8009,"prior":"by-product","sdg12":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1949","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Energy toolbox : framework for the development of a tool for the primary design of zero emission buildings in european and asian cities","authors":"Koller, Christoph; Talmon-Gros, Max; Junge, Ranka; Schuetze, Thorsten","subject":"Zero Emission Building; Net Zero-Energy Building; Net Plus-Energy Building; Passive House; Renewable energy; Building integration; Energy toolbox; Simulation tool;  Energie;  Architektur","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.79, 720","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Energy toolbox : framework for the development of a tool for the primary design of zero emission buildings in european and asian cities; Zero Emission Building; Net Zero-Energy Building; Net Plus-Energy Building; Passive House; Renewable energy; Building integration; Energy toolbox; Simulation tool;  Energie;  Architektur; This paper discusses the framework for the development of an Energy Toolbox (ETB). The aim of the ETB is to support the design of domestic Zero Emission Buildings (ZEBs), according to the concept of net zero-energy buildings during the early architectural design and planning phases. The ETB concept is based on the calculation of the energy demand for heating, cooling, lighting, and appliances. Based on a building’s energy demand, technologies for the onsite conversion and production of the specific forms and quantities of final and primary energy by means of renewable energy carriers can be identified. The calculations of the ETB are based on the building envelope properties of a primary building design, as well as the physical and climate parameters required for the calculation of heat transfer coefficients, heat gains, and heat losses. The ETB enables the selection and rough dimensioning of technologies and systems to meet, and, wherever possible, reduce the thermal and electric energy demand of a building. The technologies included comprise green facades, adaptable dynamic lighting, shading devices, heat pumps, photovoltaic generators, solar thermal collectors, adiabatic cooling, and thermal storage.

In aquaponics (AP), which is the combined cultivation of fish (aquaculture) and plants (hydroponic) in one water cycle, plants assimilate P present in aquaculture discharge. The aim of this study was to investigate the P-cycling in aquaponic in order to be able to further optimise P utilisation. For this, the effect of pH manipulation on the system was examined. Three replicates of semi-commercial size aquaponic systems, stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and planted with lettuce (Salanova® Batavia) were monitored from th September to th November . The pH was adjusted to .±. by adding acid (HCl) during weeks  and , and to .±. by adding bases (KOH and Ca(OH)) during weeks  and . Ortho-P and total-P from different sampling points in the system (system water, sludge, and deposits) were analysed. In addition, biomass production of fish and lettuce, and its nutrient content was compared between the triplicates. The P balance showed that % and % of the total P inputs provided by feed and water were absorbed by fish and plants, respectively. % of P accumulated in the system water, and % in form of deposits (biofilm on sump and fish tank surface and deposits on digester heater). Furthermore, digested sludge contained more ortho-P (-% of total-P) than fresh sludge (-% of total-P). In addition, around % of total-P was present as ortho-P in a system water. The ortho-P concentrations after the manipulations of pH in the aquaponic system water surprisingly increased with increasing pH. This is probably due to the complex dynamics between P and Ca. The established P mass balance identiﬁed and quantiﬁed several P pools, demonstrating that aquaponics systems can maximize overall P utilization if a digester is included into the loop.","doc_id":8438,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7090","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A pragmatic approach for performance assessment of advanced process control","authors":"Gupta, Arun; Mathur, Tarun; Stadler, Konrad; Gallestey, Eduardo","subject":" Ingenieurwesen","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"620","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"A pragmatic approach for performance assessment of advanced process control;  Ingenieurwesen; Methods for assessing the performance of an installed controller were studied in literature; however, assessing the benefits of an advanced controller before installation is often unstandardized.

For example, do people perceive the difference in the amount of sugar, and thus in the subjective sweet taste, between two beverages according to Weber’s law? Additionally, is that perceived difference the cause of their beverage choice? In order to investigate these questions, participants in this online experiment first had to estimate the sugar difference between two beverages based on grams and then decide whether they would switch to a lower-sugar beverage. We found that participants’ different estimates followed Weber’s law. The choice of the lower-sugar beverage, however, depended on how large they personally perceived that difference.

The aim of a circular economy is to transform these unused wastes into usable resources. This transformation from a linear to a circular system is challenging due the limited knowledge on possibilities for the reuse of such waste products. In addition, the actual reuse is hindered by several constraints such as lacking information on the specific composition of the unused waste, on the availability of the unused waste in time and space as well as on the quantity of unused waste. The goal of the SHAREBOX Horizon  project is the use information and communications technology for the development of a platform for the facilitation of circular approaches for material and waste flows within the European processing industries.The SHAREBOX platform is a database of available waste and resources required by companies. The matching of supply and demand by the platform enables the transformation of waste to resources. The platform also serves as the first point of contact between different partners in a circular system. Furthermore, the platform enables the identification of new synergies between the different subsectors of the industries as well as optimal matching from the perspective of a circular economy. We analysed the life cycle based impacts and benefits the transformation of different waste types to usable resources including relevant life cycle steps as beneficiation and transportation. The analysis for greenhouse gases, primary energy demand and mineral resource use revealed that the environmental benefit of transformation from waste to resources strongly depends on the reused material type as well as crucial properties like density of the material and geographic proximity of the partners of the synergy.

The aim of a circular economy is to transform these unused wastes into usable resources. This transformation from a linear to a circular system is challenging due the limited knowledge on possibilities for the reuse of such waste products. In addition, the actual reuse is hindered by several constraints such as lacking information on the specific composition of the unused waste, on the availability of the unused waste in time and space as well as on the quantity of unused waste. The goal of the SHAREBOX Horizon  project is the use information and communications technology for the development of a platform for the facilitation of circular approaches for material and waste flows within the European processing industries.The SHAREBOX platform is a database of available waste and resources required by companies. The matching of supply and demand by the platform enables the transformation of waste to resources. The platform also serves as the first point of contact between different partners in a circular system. Furthermore, the platform enables the identification of new synergies between the different subsectors of the industries as well as optimal matching from the perspective of a circular economy. We analysed the life cycle based impacts and benefits the transformation of different waste types to usable resources including relevant life cycle steps as beneficiation and transportation. The analysis for greenhouse gases, primary energy demand and mineral resource use revealed that the environmental benefit of transformation from waste to resources strongly depends on the reused material type as well as crucial properties like density of the material and geographic proximity of the partners of the synergy. However, the relative benefits were higher for the mineral resource compared to greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy demand, mainly due to the energy requirement in the steps beneficiation and transportation.Transformation from linear systems to circular systems can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions; primary energy demand as well as mineral resource use of the whole value chain and contribute to a greener economy.

Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services []. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized []. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.","doc_id":9626,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13875","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Decentralisation of wastewater infrastructures in Saxony","authors":"Wolf, Miriam; Störmer, Eckard","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"363","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Decentralisation of wastewater infrastructures in Saxony;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","doc_id":9631,"prior":"wastewater","sdg12":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24236","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Second hand luxury : consumer motivations behind the purchase of pre-owned luxury goods : the case of luxury watches","authors":"Baumann, Yves; Duma, Fabio","subject":"Luxury consumer behavior; Luxury consumption; Luxury marketing; Second hand luxury consumption; Luxury management;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"658.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Second hand luxury : consumer motivations behind the purchase of pre-owned luxury goods : the case of luxury watches; Luxury consumer behavior; Luxury consumption; Luxury marketing; Second hand luxury consumption; Luxury management;  Marketingmanagement; The market for pre-owned luxury watches has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Many luxury watch brands and retailers have started to realize that this market is lucrative and profitable. However, not much is known about what is driving the recent boom and what the consumer motivations are that lead to a widespread interest in preowned and vintage luxury watches. While the field of second-hand luxury consumption in general is rather well explored, scientific literature on the purchase motivations behind specific product categories, in this case pre-owned luxury watches, is scarce. The present study was led by the following research questions: What motivates consumers to acquire pre-owned luxury watches? What are the main drivers of the growing popularity of preowned luxury watches? The study is based on a thorough analysis of existing literature and primary qualitative research, including expert interviews and a computer-mediated qualitative survey to include the consumer perspective. The motivations identified in this study, namely lower price and investment (economic factors), quality and durability (sustainability factors), the need for social acceptance, social understatement, and standing out from the crowd (social factors), availability, design, and brand (product-related factors), as well as treasure hunting and collecting (recreational factors) add to and partly confirm insights in an existing body of literature on pre-owned consumer behavior which, however, is largely focused on fashion. Additionally, five drivers of the growth of the preowned luxury watch market were identified, namely the availability of luxury watches in general, financial opportunities, online channels and e-commerce, and the presence of established companies in this emerging field. The generated insight is relevant for companies in the sector and helps professionals and academics better understand a former niche phenomenon turned mainstream and adapting business models accordingly.","doc_id":9771,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8747","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Funktionalisierte Polymere : Klebstoffentwicklung","authors":"Brändli, Christof","subject":"Klebstoff; Polymer Engineering; Polymer; Entwicklung;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"660","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Funktionalisierte Polymere : Klebstoffentwicklung; Klebstoff; Polymer Engineering; Polymer; Entwicklung;  Technische Chemie; Der Begriff «Polymer Engineering» bezeichnet die Anwendung der Polymerwissenschaft auf praktische Probleme im Zusammenhang mit Eigenschaften und die Verwendung von Polymermaterialien in anspruchsvollen Umgebungen.

In order to  determine which areas of  a hospital contribute most to  the  environmental impact, a  life  cycle assessment of    acute care hospitals in Switzerland was conducted. The environmental impact of these hospitals was analysed at midpoint level for  environmental impact categories. The functional unit (FU) was defined as healthcare services provided by one full-time equivalent for one year. The analysis shows that building infrastructure and catering are the main contributors for various environmental impacts, followed by heating and electricity. Waste and wastewater, pharmaceuticals, and medical and housekeeping products are relevant for at least three categories, whereas textiles, and paper use and printing are only relevant for one to two categories.

It is assumed that the research strand, by reducing such gaps, contributes to the United Nations SDGs  (clean energy),  (sustainable cities) and  (climate action). However, in this conceptual article based on literature review we argue that blind spots in the current definition of energy performance gap research (embodied energy, gap between optimal and planned energy performance, greenhouse gas emissions, dynamic character) and weaknesses of frequently used scientific paradigms (techno-economic, psychological) may lead to the fact that the measures identified to eliminate energy wasting and climate-damaging practices are of limited value. In fact, it is quite possible that conventional energy performance gap research even contributes to perpetuating such practices. The authors therefore call for a definition and paradigm shift in energy performance gap research, suggesting two broader definitions of the research subject (called life cycle energy performance gaps and climate performance gaps) and a promising alternative scientific paradigm (practice theory).","doc_id":9972,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/25014","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Development of a smart connected product-service-system (PSS) for the waste management ecosystem","authors":"Barth, Linard; Sarperi, Luciano; Dettling, Marcel; Meierhofer, Jürg; Bulatovic, Andjela; Schweiger, Lukas","subject":"Digital twin; Ecosystem; Internet of things; Smart city; Waste management; Platform; Case study; Smart services;  Informatik;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004, 363","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Development of a smart connected product-service-system (PSS) for the waste management ecosystem; Digital twin; Ecosystem; Internet of things; Smart city; Waste management; Platform; Case study; Smart services;  Informatik;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; The project aims to exploit the potential of digitalization for the waste management ecosystem in Switzerland.

ZHAW has the ability to execute applied research, teaching on BSc and MSc level, and is aiming to increase societal added value concerning education and health. Each of these levels has different demands on the aquaponic system concerning a multitude of factors, such as access, size, construction, climate control, diversity of production methods, recycling and closed loop systems, provision of energy from renewable sources and rainwater harvesting, treatment and use. To evaluate how these objectives are reached, the requirements on the system originating from each level are defined. These are used to evaluate the aquaponic system that was built and operated at ZHAW. Other aquaponic systems in use are compared to the ZHAW system, using the same evaluation criteria. The results show that the ZHAW Aquaponics Lab can reach all target levels, if the aquaponic farm of its spin-off company UrbanFarmers is viewed as an extension of it.","doc_id":10061,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6599","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Ausgaben für Produktionsmittel : Studie des Bauernverbands","authors":"Hilber, Urs","subject":" Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"1996","for_data_analysis":"Ausgaben für Produktionsmittel : Studie des Bauernverbands;  Landwirtschaft","doc_id":10084,"prior":"Produktionsmittel","sdg12":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2471","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"UF001 LokDepot, Basel : the first commercial rooftop aquaponic farm in Switzerland","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Durno, Mark; Gaus, Roman; Mathis, Alex; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Building integrated agriculture;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"630","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"UF LokDepot, Basel : the first commercial rooftop aquaponic farm in Switzerland; Aquaponics; Building integrated agriculture;  Landwirtschaft; Introduction: Aquaponics is an innovative and sustainable food production system integrating aquaculture with hydroponic vegetal crops. This emerging technology has the potential to play a key role in provision of food while tackling global challenges such as water scarcity, food safety, food security, urbanization, and reductions in energy use and food miles. While it is a widely discussed technology today (about .m hits on Google in May ), only very few research papers were published describing efficiency and performance of real systems. Results: In , the Swiss company UrbanFarmers, a spin-off of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) built a  m greenhouse farm on an industrial rooftop in Basel (UF ). Together with the research team at ZHAW, the aquaponic farm layout was planned, installed, operated and monitored. In its first year of operations,  kg Tilapia and ’ kg of different vegetables were produced and sold to restaurants, and to Migros, Switzerland’s largest retailer. This pilot farm achieved three major goals: to showcase the proof of technology for aquaponic rooftop farms, to demonstrate proof of market acceptance by Swiss consumers for this new way of farming food, and to deliver key performance figures that allow planning and scale-up for future commercially interesting farm units. Conclusion: Further innovations are required that simplify operations and enable cost-effective aquaponic farming, while making the products safe for human consumption: new planting techniques, new varieties of produce, biological pest control, irrigation techniques, and integration with existing building infrastructures.","doc_id":10147,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"77","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4239","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Heavy-users, light-users and age groups : the impact of age and consumption frequency on discrimination ability in a hedonic test","authors":"Kinner, Julia; Vjelkovic, Zorica; Bongartz, Annette","subject":"Sensitivity; Central location test; Age; Consumption frequency;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"664","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Heavy-users, light-users and age groups : the impact of age and consumption frequency on discrimination ability in a hedonic test; Sensitivity; Central location test; Age; Consumption frequency;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","doc_id":10224,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"4","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2929","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Combining single-use stirred bioreactor with standard cross-flow technology in biphasic protein production processes at pilot scale","authors":"Blaschczok, Katharina; Löffelholz, Christian; Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Eibl, Dieter","subject":"Biphasic protein expression; Chinese hamster ovary cells; Hollow fiber module; SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase); Stirred single-use bioreactor;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Combining single-use stirred bioreactor with standard cross-flow technology in biphasic protein production processes at pilot scale; Biphasic protein expression; Chinese hamster ovary cells; Hollow fiber module; SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase); Stirred single-use bioreactor;  Technische Chemie; The increasing implementation of single-use bioreactors arrived hand-in-hand with the development of new technologies contributing to increased productivity, process flexibility, and additional savings in time and costs.

In this regard, interest in reducing meat consumption is on the rise. However, people often do not translate intentions into actual behavior change. To address this intention-behavior gap, we tested the self-regulation strategy of mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII). Here, people identify and imagine a desired future and current obstacles standing in its way. They address the obstacles with if-then plans specifying when, where, and how to act differently. In a -week randomized controlled experimental study, we compared an information C MCII intervention with an information-only control intervention. As hypothesized, only MCII participants’ intention of reducing their meat consumption was predictive of their actual reduction, while no correspondence between intention and behavior change was found for control participants.

Damit die Umsetzung der Energiestrategie  vorangetrieben werden kann, braucht es eine fundierte Datengrundlage zum heutigen Energieverbrauch. Solche Daten sind mit der Gesamtenergiestatistik auf nationaler Ebene verfügbar. Die Mehrzahl der Kantone, welche eine grosse Verantwortung bei der Umsetzung der Energiestrategie  tragen, verfügt bis heute allerdings nicht über verlässliche Energieverbrauchsdaten.Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es daher, die kantonalen Energieverbräuche aus den nationalen Daten abzuleiten und darauf basierend zu bestimmen, welche finanziellen Beträge durch den Import von Energie jährlich ins Ausland fliessen. Die Aufteilung des gesamtschweizerischen Energieverbrauchs auf die Kantone erfolgte nach Möglichkeiten nach dem Territorialprinzip. Die Energieverbräuche werden damit denjenigen Kantonen angerechnet, in denen die Energie bezogen wird. Der Mittelabfluss wurde anhand des Produkts von Importpreis und Importmenge bestimmt.Der berechnete Pro‐Kopf‐Energiebedarf pro Jahr liegt bei den Kantonen zwischen . MWh (Kanton Waadt) und . MWh (Kanton Basel‐Stadt), wobei sich der Pro‐Kopf‐Energiebedarf des Kantons Basel‐Stadt auf . MWh/Einwohner reduziert, wenn der Tanktourismus und der Flugverkehr ausgeklammert werden. Dass der Energiebedarf des Kantons Basel‐Stadt auch in diesem Fall noch überdurchschnittlich hoch ist, liegt hauptsächlich am hohen Energiebedarf der Branchengruppe \"Chemie/ Pharma\".Ein Grossteil des Energiebedarfs der Kantone wird durch importierte Energieträger gedeckt (Heizöl, Benzin, Diesel, Erdgas etc.). Dadurch fliessen gesamtschweizerisch jährlich knapp  Milliarden Franken ins Ausland. Absolut betrachtet ist der Mittelabfluss in den Kantonen Zürich und Bern am grössten, während der Mittelabfluss pro Einwohner in den Kantonen Basel‐Stadt und Genf überdurchschnittlich hoch ist. Werden die Flugtreibstoffe und der Tanktourismus vernachlässigt, so liegt der jährliche Mittelabfluss pro Einwohner in allen Kantonen bei ‘ ±  Franken. Rund % bis % des Mittelabflusses der Kantone sind auf den Import von Benzin und Diesel zurückzuführen, während Heizöl zwischen % und % des Mittelabflusses der Kantone ausmacht.Bei einer Weiterführung der heutigen Energiepolitik wird der Mittelabfluss auch zukünftig hoch bleiben. Zwar wird für die Zukunft ein sinkender Energieverbrauch prognostiziert, wegen der steigenden Importpreise nimmt aber der Mittelabfluss je nach Preisszenario nur leicht ab oder sogar stark zu. Dies bedeutet, dass die heutigen Massnahmen nicht ausreichen, um den Mittelabfluss längerfristig substanziell zu reduzieren. Damit die Energiebereitstellung zukünftig vermehrt zur lokalen Wertschöpfung beitragen kann, sind zusätzliche Investitionen in die Energieeffizienz und eine stärkere Förderung lokaler, erneuerbarer Energien nötig. In diesem Zusammenhang spielen die Kantone insbesondere in den beiden Bereichen Gebäude und Raumplanung eine Schlüsselrolle. Durch die Umsetzung von kantonalen Energiestrategien können sie massgeblich zur Energiewende beitragen.","doc_id":10325,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"76","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20911","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Stimmen von Schweizer Grossunternehmen zur digitalen Verwaltung der Schweiz","authors":"Brüesch, Caroline; Mertes, Alexander; Fischer, Damaris; Giger, Marc-André; Lamprecht, Matthias","subject":"Digitale Verwaltung;  Soziale Prozesse;  Öffentliche Verwaltung","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"303, 350","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Stimmen von Schweizer Grossunternehmen zur digitalen Verwaltung der Schweiz; Digitale Verwaltung;  Soziale Prozesse;  Öffentliche Verwaltung; Die Digitalisierung bietet der öffentlichen Hand die Chance, durch innovative und moderne Interaktionsformen die bisherigen Dienstleistungen zu optimieren und neu zu gestalten.

Hence, the concept of active packaging materializes as a technology to enhance the safety, quality and shelf-life of the packaged foods. Active packaging systems can contribute to the reduction of food waste by providing, apart from an inert barrier to external conditions, several functions associated with food preservation, namely absorbing/scavenging, releasing/emitting and removing properties, temperature, microbial and quality control.Scope and approach: The purpose of this review is to present a concise (but wide-ranging) appraisal on the latest advances in active agents for active food packaging. Emphasis is placed on active functions such as antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, oxygen and ethylene scavenging, and carbon dioxide emitting. An effort was made to highlight representative articles that prompted research on active agents towards viable market solutions.Key findings and conclusions: Active packaging is a thriving field given its duality as barrier to external detrimental factors and active role in food preservation and quality. The use of natural active agents is a flourishing field due to the general concern towards natural-based additives. Nevertheless, research is still in its early stages with a long way to go in the design of innovative and economical active packaging materials containing appropriate active agents.

A technology to produce solar electricity as well as heat are photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors (PVT). PVT modules are a promising technology since they not only allow for the generation of heat in addition to electricity but they also increase the solar conversion efficiency due to the cooling effect of the heat exchanger on the photovoltaic panel. The aim of our analysis was to quantify the environmental impact of a PVT system in comparison to other systems for the provision of electricity and hot water. Therefore, we collected information on the production of PVT modules from the producer DualSun and established corresponding Life Cycle Inventory models for the full life cycle of PVT modules. As comparison systems for electricity and heat production we used () photovoltaics in combination with a solar thermal system, () European electricity mix at grid in combination with a natural gas-fired boiler and () European electricity mix at in combination with an air-water heat pump. The functional unit is defined as the energy yield of  kWh of electricity and . kWh of hot water over a life time of  years. The PVT module is modelled as combination of photovoltaic module and a heat exchanger as well as mounting system, electrical components including inverters and thermal components including hot water storage, pipes and circulation pumps. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment includes greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy, ReCiPe  Endpoint (H) as well as the recommended midpoints for PEF..\tScientific innovation and relevanceOur research focuses on the application of Life Cycle Assessment methodology to novel photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector produced by DualSun. The main advantage of PVT modules is the potential to produce heat as an additional by product while simultaneously increasing the electricity yield. This co-production of electricity and heat poses challenges for Life Cycle Assessment methodology since it would either require allocation or system expansion. For this study, we avoided allocation with the use system expansion in the context of electricity and heat supply in buildings, using comparable systems for electricity and heat supply in residential buildings as reference. The major scientific innovations are: ) the Life Cycle Assessment of novel photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector (PVT) and ) the comparison of PVT modules to different systems providing electricity as well as heat in buildings without an allocation of the impacts to either electricity or heat generation. .\tResults and conclusionsIn Figure  the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from a PVT installation are visualized. The production of  kWh of electricity as well as . kWh of heat using a PVT system causes greenhouse gas emissions of  g CO-eq according to the IPCC  GWP a. The components electricity (yellow) include the inverter, the cabling and all electrical equipment up to the grid connection. The components for providing hot water (blue) include all pipes, circulation pumps, valves and a hot water tank. % of all greenhouse gases origin from the production of the PV panel. The contribution of the mounting structure and the electrical as well as thermal balance-of-system (BOS) components to the total greenhouse gas emissions is very similar with about % each (see Figure ). The PVT modules have lower environmental impacts than the combination of separate PV and solar thermal collectors. When compared to the conventional electricity and heat supply with electricity from grid as well as natural gas boiler, the use of PVT modules would cause considerable savings of greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution of the heat exchanger as well as the components for the use of heat (thermal storage, pipes, etc) have a contribution below  % for all midpoints analysed (see Figure  and Figure ) except for human health cancer ( %), eco-toxicity ( %) and land use ( %). This means that PVT modules can produce renewable heat in addition to electricity with a rather small investment in additional impacts for most midpoints. If we compare this investment to the potential savings possible due to the use of renewable heat from PVT modules instead natural gas (or oil) boilers as common heating systems in central Europe, this reveals significant potentials for carbon savings as well as savings for other environmental impacts. The electric and thermal yield of PVT modules depend on the temperature at which the hot water is discharged from the heat exchanger: with lower temperature, electric and thermal yield are increased and therefore environmental impacts per kWh harvested energy are decreased. In this study, we used a rather low thermal yield of  kWh of heat per square meter of PVT module, since hot water is generally used at higher temperatures.

A technology to produce solar electricity as well as heat are photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors (PVT). PVT modules are a promising technology since they not only allow for the generation of heat in addition to electricity but they also increase the solar conversion efficiency due to the cooling effect of the heat exchanger on the photovoltaic panel. The aim of our analysis was to quantify the environmental impact of a PVT system in comparison to other systems for the provision of electricity and hot water. Therefore, we collected information on the production of PVT modules from the producer DualSun and established corresponding Life Cycle Inventory models for the full life cycle of PVT modules. As comparison systems for electricity and heat production we used () photovoltaics in combination with a solar thermal system, () European electricity mix at grid in combination with a natural gas-fired boiler and () European electricity mix at in combination with an air-water heat pump. The functional unit is defined as the energy yield of  kWh of electricity and . kWh of hot water over a life time of  years. The PVT module is modelled as combination of photovoltaic module and a heat exchanger as well as mounting system, electrical components including inverters and thermal components including hot water storage, pipes and circulation pumps. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment includes greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy, ReCiPe  Endpoint (H) as well as the recommended midpoints for PEF..\tScientific innovation and relevanceOur research focuses on the application of Life Cycle Assessment methodology to novel photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector produced by DualSun. The main advantage of PVT modules is the potential to produce heat as an additional by product while simultaneously increasing the electricity yield. This co-production of electricity and heat poses challenges for Life Cycle Assessment methodology since it would either require allocation or system expansion. For this study, we avoided allocation with the use system expansion in the context of electricity and heat supply in buildings, using comparable systems for electricity and heat supply in residential buildings as reference. The major scientific innovations are: ) the Life Cycle Assessment of novel photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector (PVT) and ) the comparison of PVT modules to different systems providing electricity as well as heat in buildings without an allocation of the impacts to either electricity or heat generation. .\tResults and conclusionsIn Figure  the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from a PVT installation are visualized. The production of  kWh of electricity as well as . kWh of heat using a PVT system causes greenhouse gas emissions of  g CO-eq according to the IPCC  GWP a. The components electricity (yellow) include the inverter, the cabling and all electrical equipment up to the grid connection. The components for providing hot water (blue) include all pipes, circulation pumps, valves and a hot water tank. % of all greenhouse gases origin from the production of the PV panel. The contribution of the mounting structure and the electrical as well as thermal balance-of-system (BOS) components to the total greenhouse gas emissions is very similar with about % each (see Figure ). The PVT modules have lower environmental impacts than the combination of separate PV and solar thermal collectors. When compared to the conventional electricity and heat supply with electricity from grid as well as natural gas boiler, the use of PVT modules would cause considerable savings of greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution of the heat exchanger as well as the components for the use of heat (thermal storage, pipes, etc) have a contribution below  % for all midpoints analysed (see Figure  and Figure ) except for human health cancer ( %), eco-toxicity ( %) and land use ( %). This means that PVT modules can produce renewable heat in addition to electricity with a rather small investment in additional impacts for most midpoints. If we compare this investment to the potential savings possible due to the use of renewable heat from PVT modules instead natural gas (or oil) boilers as common heating systems in central Europe, this reveals significant potentials for carbon savings as well as savings for other environmental impacts. The electric and thermal yield of PVT modules depend on the temperature at which the hot water is discharged from the heat exchanger: with lower temperature, electric and thermal yield are increased and therefore environmental impacts per kWh harvested energy are decreased. In this study, we used a rather low thermal yield of  kWh of heat per square meter of PVT module, since hot water is generally used at higher temperatures. However, if the desired temperature level of the usable heat is lower, the thermal yield of PVT modules would increase significantly up to two times as much usable heat. In conclusion, the comparison of PVT modules with other systems to provide electricity and heat revealed significant potentials for reduced environmental impacts even for the conservative case of low thermal yields.","doc_id":10643,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19626","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Sichtbar grün : eine Analyse grüner Kundensegmente und ihrer Konsummotive","authors":"Kübler, Marisa","subject":" Marketingmanagement","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"658.8","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Sichtbar grün : eine Analyse grüner Kundensegmente und ihrer Konsummotive;  Marketingmanagement; Der Umweltschutz ist omnipräsent. Weil sich immer grössere Teile der europäischen Bevölkerung der unumkehrbaren Folgen der Klimaerwärmung bewusst werden, wird zunehmend grüner konsumiert. Die Forschung geht bisher davon aus, dass vor allem ökologische oder altruistische Motive Hauptgrund für diese Art von Konsum sind. Die vorliegende Studie hingegen widmet sich zusätzlich zu bisher erforschten Motiven weiteren, teils unbewussten Motiven, die den Umweltschutz zwar nicht direkt bezwecken, gleichwohl aber zu grünem Konsumverhalten führen. In der Forschung wird weitestgehend davon ausgegangen, dass sich die beiden Konsumentengruppen «Materialisten» und «Grüne Konsumenten» grundlegend unterscheiden. Gleichzeitig werden sie in bisherigen Studien nur isoliert betrachtet. Erst wenige Pionierstudien liefern wegweisende Erkenntnisse darüber, dass sich die beiden Gruppen aber nicht dichotom verhalten müssen, sondern in gewissen Teilaspekten bedeutsame Überschneidungen aufweisen können.  Die vorliegende Studie untersucht sowohl grüne und materialistische Konsumentenprofile als auch sogenannte Voluntary Simplifier (VS).  VS praktizieren grünen Konsum nicht nur durch den Kauf möglichst grüner Produkte, sondern durch die erhebliche Reduktion des eigenen Konsums. Alle untersuchten Konsumentengruppen werden in Bezug auf ihr grünes Verhalten entlang des gesamten Konsumzyklus befragt, um so eine möglichst fundierte Wissensbasis des Konsumentenverhaltens und damit aussagekräftige Ergebnisse zu generieren. Die Studie zeigt auf, dass grüne Konsumenten entgegen der gängigen Annahme durchaus materialistisch motiviert sein können. Dies äussert sich in der Verfolgung materialistischer Lebensziele, die mitunter Motiv von grünem Konsum sein können. Diese Erkenntnis zeigt sich auch in einem mit Hilfe einer Cluster-Analyse neu entdeckten Segment. Dieses übt grünes Konsumverhalten aus und misst dem eigenen äusseren Erscheinungsbild (Image) und der Bewunderung durch andere bzw. der eigenen Bekanntheit (Popularity) grosse Wichtigkeit bei. Gleichzeitig vertritt das Segment neben diesen materialistischen Werten auch Werte der Grünen und der VS. Deshalb wird das Segment «Grüne Materialisten mit VS-Tendenz» genannt. Das Vorhandensein dieses Segments zeigt auf, dass grüner Konsum nicht durch ökologisches Denken oder Altruismus motiviert sein muss.

Damit jeder Abschnitt ausführlich analysiert werden kann, ist dieses Dokument als theoretische Arbeit geschrieben. Die Analyse berücksichtigt fünf Hauptabsatzmärkte von Elektroautos (USA, China, Deutschland, Norwegen, Schweiz) und wird exemplarisch an zwei Vergleichsfahrzeugen durchgeführt: Für die Analyse wird das weltweit meistverkaufte Elektroauto, das Tesla Model , dem vergleichbaren Benzinauto BMW i gegenübergestellt. In der Herstellung emittiert der Tesla -% mehr CO als der BMW, da die Produktion des Lithium-Ionen-Akkus, der in jedem modernen Elektrofahrzeug eingesetzt wird, sehr viel Energie bedarf. Während der Nutzungsphase hängt der CO-Ausstoss des Elektroautos von der CO-Intensität des Strommixes in den jeweiligen Ländern ab. Wird der Tesla in den USA, China oder Deutschland genutzt, ist er nach etwa ' gefahrenen Kilometern umweltfreundlicher als der BMW nach derselben gefahrenen Strecke. In der Schweiz oder in Norwegen ist dies bereits nach etwa ' Kilometer der Fall, da diese Länder den Strom CO-arm produzieren.Der Recyclingprozess von herkömmlichen Benzinfahrzeugen emittiert wenig CO.

Empirical interviews were conducted with various executives and academics to identify FM-related aspects that should be considered during the planning, design and construction of buildings. These insights are the foundation of a newly developed monitoring tool which can be applied to different settings.Findings: When analyzing relevant aspects of FM, ten main categories were identified, together with corresponding sub-categories. These were used as input for a quality assurance tool designed to analyze the degree to which FM is taken into consideration in the early stages of planning. Respondents fill out an item battery, using a five-point scale. The questions refer to the completeness and plausibility of the respective (sub-)category. This newly developed monitoring-tool has been applied to a construction project in the city center of Zurich/Switzerland.Research limitations/implications: The monitoring tool presented here is only a first attempt to structure and analyze important aspects of FM during the early stages of building construction.

In other regions, excessive P inputs produce economic inefficiencies and increase the risk of P loss, with negative environmental consequences. During the year of application, plants recover – % of the added P, with the remaining fraction converting to less soluble forms or residual P which becomes plant available over time. Improving P efficiency requires a balance between the imperatives to produce more food while minimizing P losses. Utilizing transdisciplinary approaches, a number of social, economic, and environmental goals can be simultaneously achieved if progress is made toward short- and long-term food security and global P sustainability. This chapter provides an overview of efforts to improve P use efficiency in agriculture ranging from promising germplasm, improved crop, and soil management scenarios, additives in animal diets to reduce P inputs and surplus P in the manure, and opportunities for P recycling in food and household waste. Challenges and opportunities associated with each option are discussed and transdisciplinary case studies outlined.","doc_id":11396,"prior":"household waste","sdg12":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23292","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Cultivation of microalgae at high-density with pretreated liquid digestate as a nitrogen source : fate of nitrogen and improvements on growth limitations","authors":"Pulgarin, Adrian; Kapeller, Alexander Garcia; Tarik, Mohamed; Egloff, Sophia; Mariotto, Marina; Ludwig, Christian; Refardt, Dominik","subject":"Microalgae; High-density cultivation; Liquid digestate; Nutrient recycling; Nitrogen mass balance;  Biologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Cultivation of microalgae at high-density with pretreated liquid digestate as a nitrogen source : fate of nitrogen and improvements on growth limitations; Microalgae; High-density cultivation; Liquid digestate; Nutrient recycling; Nitrogen mass balance;  Biologie; A liquid digestate rich in ammonium nitrogen (. g L−) was collected from an agricultural biogas plant and supplied to microalgae cultures as their only nitrogen source.

Kaum ein Unternehmen aus der Branche Handel und Industrie ist in der Lage, den gesamten Produktionsprozess von der Rohstoffgewinnung über die Fertigung bis hin zum Vertrieb der Ware ohne Partner zu stemmen. Die Lieferketten haben vermehrt ein globales Ausmass angenommen und entsprechend ist es entscheidend geworden, Verhandlungen mit Lieferanten, Zwischenhändlern und Kunden zu führen.

Drawing on institutional sociology and organizational studies, resources, discourses and networks of actors are identified as key elements enabling institutional work practices. The agency of each actor is conceived of as dependent on the configurations it possesses with respect to these elements.

As the industry grows, the manufacturing processes and the material and energy efficiencies of PV cells and panels are improving. To assess the impacts of this trend, future scenarios of single-crystalline (single-Si, also known as mono-crystalline) silicon and cadmium-telluride (CdTe) PV systems installed on European residences were established. Assessment of the improvement potential of PV electricity-generating technologies such as single-Si and CdTe could be considered in long-term energy strategy decisions.This study aims to provide scenario-based information about the environmental performance of single-Si and CdTe PV modules produced and operated in the far future ( to ). The deployment application assessed considers European residential roofs. We made scenario-dependent projections of key parameters for single-Si and CdTe PV panels manufactured in . The parameters included cell efficiency, module efficiency, wafer thickness, cutting losses, kerf losses, silver use, glass thickness and operational lifetime.This study combines developments for these parameters with projections of the environmental performance of electricity mixes in the main manufacturing countries/regions (European Union, China and the United States of America) and with projections of the environmental performance of basic material production (aluminium, copper, magnesium, nickel, pig iron, zinc, clinker and flat glass) in the far future. The three scenarios used in the assessment of future PV electricity were categorized into three classes: “business as usual” (BAU), “realistic improvement” (REAL) and “optimistic improvement” (OPT).It estimates the current life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of single-Si PV electricity produced on the roofs of European residences to be approximately  grams CO-equivalent per kWh (g CO-eq per kWh). Based on the projected changes to key parameters and the background system, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be reduced to  % (scenario BAU),  % (scenario REAL) and  % (scenario OPT) of that value in the far future.Results for other life cycle assessment (LCA) metrics are also assessed in this study such as: non-renewable cumulative energy demand, acidification potential, human toxicity potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, particulate matter formation potential, and land use.We calculated the total energy payback time (EPBT) and the non-renewable energy payback time (NREPBT) in the far future of single-crystalline silicon-based PV panels operated in Europe by dividing the estimate of non-renewable cumulative energy demand of PV electricity for the given scenario by the non-renewable cumulative energy demand of the scenario-dependent national and regional non-renewable residual electricity mixes.The study estimates the payback time could be reduced from . years today to ., . and . years (scenarios BAU, REAL and OPT, respectively) in the far future, based on the assumptions and projections in the analysis.It finally estimates the current life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of CdTe PV electricity produced on the roofs of European residences to be approximately  g CO-eq per kWh.

The relevance analysis is carried out to identify the most relevant unit processes and S-LCA indicators and the Swiss PRPs (SPRPs) are designed to compare the social issues along the value chain to the situation in Switzerland. The methodology was applied to two life cycle stages of the copper supply chain (resource extraction and wire production), relevant for the production of renewable energy technologies, where it was found that the most critical step is mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to the artisanal way of mining. The proposed methodology offers a comprehensive overview for the analysis of supply chains and the comparison of different life cycle phases.

However, TPs are rarely considered in prospective environmental risk assessments of wastewater-relevant compound classes such as pharmaceuticals and biocides. Here, we suggest and evaluate a tiered procedure, which includes a fast initial screening step based on high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS) and a subsequent confirmatory quantitative analysis, that should facilitate consideration of TPs formed during activated sludge treatment in the exposure assessment of micropollutants. At the first tier, potential biotransformation product structures of seven pharmaceuticals (atenolol, bezafibrate, ketoprofen, metoprolol, ranitidine, valsartan, and venlafaxine) and one biocide (carbendazim) were assembled using computer-based biotransformation pathway prediction and known human metabolites. These target structures were screened for in sludge-seeded batch reactors using HR-MS/MS. The  TPs found to form in the batch experiments were then searched for in the effluents of two full-scale, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to confirm the environmental representativeness of this first tier. At the second tier, experiments with the same sludge-seeded batch reactors were carried out to acquire kinetic data for major TPs that were then used as input parameters into a cascaded steady-state completely-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model for predicting TP effluent concentrations. Predicted effluent concentrations of four parent compounds and their three major TPs were corroborated by comparison to -day average influent and secondary effluent mass flows from one municipal WWTP. CSTR model-predicted secondary effluent mass flows agreed within a factor of two with measured mass flows and confidence intervals of predicted and measured mass flows overlapped in all cases. The observed agreement suggests that the combination of batch-determined transformation kinetics with a simple WWTP model may be suitable for estimating aquatic exposure to TPs formed during activated sludge treatment. Overall, we recommend the tiered procedure as a realistic and cost-effective approach to include consideration of TPs of wastewater-relevant compounds into exposure assessment in the context of prospective chemical risk assessment.","doc_id":11711,"prior":"wastewater","sdg12":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24104","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Anthropogenic feeding of red kites in Switzerland : motivations and consequences","authors":"Schreiber, Hanna","subject":" Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"590","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Anthropogenic feeding of red kites in Switzerland : motivations and consequences;  Tiere (Zoologie); The provision of food for garden birds is one of the most widespread and popular forms of human-wildlife interaction throughout western countries. Yet despite its popularity, little is known about the reasons why people feed wild birds, especially raptors. Although bird feeding can have a positive impact on both the birds and the people feeding them, there are also undesirable side effects. Increasing complaints from neighbours of such feeding sites in recent years have shown that there is an existing conflict. So far, there is only little knowledge about the negative effects that feeding sites can have on surrounding neighbours and what factors influence whether a person feels disturbed by the feeding or not. Our study aimed to explore the motivations behind red kite feeding, which represents an increasing trend in Switzerland. By interviewing  people who regularly feed red kites, we found that pleasure, connecting with nature and the desire to nurture are the main reasons why people provide food for red kites in several Swiss regions. The further objective of this study was to analyse the disturbing factors for people living near these feeding sites in detail with a mixed methods approach. First, eight people living close to feeding sites were interviewed to explore their attitudes and concerns towards the red kite feeding. The information gained from the semi-structured interviews served to develop a questionnaire, which was used to survey  people during the following quantitative stage. Analysing the responses, we found several disturbing factors that can result from feeding sites, with noise pollution, food waste and bird excrements being the most important ones. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between the people providing food for birds and their neighbour determines how that person perceives the feeding. Understanding value orientations and attitudes of stakeholders involved in such a conflict is crucial for developing solutions and compromises. By highlighting the attitudes and motivations of both feeders and their neighbours, our study facilitates future conflict management.","doc_id":11717,"prior":"food waste","sdg12":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4649","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Navigating behavioral energy sufficiency : results from a survey in Swiss cities on potential behavior change","authors":"Seidl, Roman; Moser, Corinne; Blumer, Yann","subject":"Carbon Dioxide; Citiy; Fossil Fuel; Human; Nuclear Energy; Surveys and Questionnaire; Switzerland; Behavior; Climate Change;  Energie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.79","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Navigating behavioral energy sufficiency : results from a survey in Swiss cities on potential behavior change; Carbon Dioxide; Citiy; Fossil Fuel; Human; Nuclear Energy; Surveys and Questionnaire; Switzerland; Behavior; Climate Change;  Energie; Many countries have some kind of energy-system transformation either planned or ongoing for various reasons, such as to curb carbon emissions or to compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy. One important component of these transformations is the overall reduction in energy demand. It is generally acknowledged that the domestic sector represents a large share of total energy consumption in many countries. Increased energy efficiency is one factor that reduces energy demand, but behavioral approaches (known as \"sufficiency\") and their respective interventions also play important roles. In this paper, we address citizens' heterogeneity regarding both their current behaviors and their willingness to realize their sufficiency potentials-that is, to reduce their energy consumption through behavioral change. We collaborated with three Swiss cities for this study. A survey conducted in the three cities yielded thematic sets of energy-consumption behavior that various groups of participants rated differently.

Whether making use of CAM therapies is associated with an altered usage of therapies from conventional medicine is, to date, not precisely known.Aims: The present work aims to quantify how CAM use affects the consumption of conventional medications.Methods: Data from the  Swiss Health Survey were used to define two types of participants: CAM users (those who had used of any of  types of CAM during the last  months, n = ) and non-users (those that stated not having used any of the listed CAM-therapies during the last  months, n = ). Consumption of several conventional medications as well as demographic parameters, perceived health condition and some lifestyle characteristics were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of CAM use and to address relevance and magnitude of the differences in medication consumption between CAM users and non-users.Results:The following factors were associated with increased probability of using CAM: younger age, female gender, having French as the national language, high education, lower body mass index (BMI), as well as suffering from migraine, arthritis, allergies or depression. From the multivariate logistic regression models, with which the effects of demographic factors, BMI and perceived health were compensated for, we concluded that CAM users consumed fewer medications for cardiovascular diseases – high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart problems (and diabetes). On the other hand, it was observed that their consumption of analgesics, medications for depression and for constipation (and sedatives) was higher.Conclusions:While suffering from some diseases such as migraine, arthritis, depression and constipation might lead patients both to make use of CAM therapies and to consume more of some conventional medications, this study indicates that people suffering from chronic cardiovascular problems may have benefited from CAM use, as they consumed less conventional medications, even upon compensating for well-known risk factors and with similar rates of high cholesterol and infarction. Given their long intake period and their considerable side effects, the lower consumption of medications for chronic cardiovascular problems by CAM users deserves further investigations.","doc_id":11822,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"93","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6992","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Removal of Escherichia coli by intermittent operation of saturated sand columns supplemented with hydrochar derived from sewage sludge","authors":"Chung, Jae Wook; Edewi, Oghosa Charles; Foppen, Jan Willem; Gerner, Gabriel; Krebs, Rolf; Lens, Piet Nicolaas Luc","subject":"Escherichia coli; Bacterial removal; Sewage sludge; Chloride tracer; Hydrothermal carbonization; Hydrochar;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Removal of Escherichia coli by intermittent operation of saturated sand columns supplemented with hydrochar derived from sewage sludge; Escherichia coli; Bacterial removal; Sewage sludge; Chloride tracer; Hydrothermal carbonization; Hydrochar;  Technische Chemie; Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technology can convert various types of waste biomass into a carbon-rich product referred to as hydrochar.

Furthermore, the removal of E. coli based on intermittent operation in larger columns of  cm was measured for  days. Since the removal of E. coli was not sufficient when the sand columns were supplemented with raw hydrochar, an additional cold-alkali activation of the hydrochar using potassium hydroxide was applied. This enabled more than % of E. coli removal in both the  cm and  cm column experiments.

Burnout has become a favored concept within this context. Most burnout research has concentrated on various professional groups and less so on ordinary community samples. We analyzed the data collected from a -year community sample during seven measuring occasions, beginning in . In the last assessment (), we included for the first time the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Making the diagnosis of a lifetime mental disorder a predictor for burnout required us to compile the cumulative prevalence rate over all seven occasions. We also evaluated various psycho-social predictors of burnout over the life cycle of our sample. Concurrent associations of the MBI with subscales from the SCL--R were also investigated. The relationship of burnout with several SCL--R subscales demonstrated that, in all dimensions, burnout is associated with significant psychopathology. Persons with a lifetime mood disorder, and especially those with a combination of mood and anxiety disorders, had a higher risk for subsequent burnout. Various partnership problems were another predictor for burnout. In conclusion, the role of mental disorder as an occupational illness remains controversial. Various forms of such disorders as well as some psycho-social predictors can predispose to burnout. By contrast, work-related predictors appear to be less important.","doc_id":11880,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"65","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12382","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Behandlung des Prozessabwassers aus hydrothermal karbonisiertem Klärschlamm vor der Einleitung in eine ARA","authors":"Baier, Urs; Kühni, Martin; Wanner, Rahel; Krebs, Rolf","subject":"Klärschlamm; Abwasser; Hydrothermal; Karbonisierung;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"620","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Behandlung des Prozessabwassers aus hydrothermal karbonisiertem Klärschlamm vor der Einleitung in eine ARA; Klärschlamm; Abwasser; Hydrothermal; Karbonisierung;  Ingenieurwesen; Klärschlamm wird auf Grund problematischer Inhaltsstoffe zunehmend der Verbrennung zugeführt.

A transformation of the whole system though is needed. However, technical and organisational improvements to increase efficiency of the food chain will not be sufficient to achieve a food system remaining within the planetary boundaries. Changes in dietary habits at the individual level are unavoidable, e.g. the reduction of meat consumption. Sufficiency is often been discussed in the context of different domains such as energy or housing, though little in the context of food consumption. To gain insights on individual choices for a sufficiency diet (e.g. vegetarian, a qualitative study on individual motivations has been conducted. In a first step determinants were identified from literature which can be considered as a framework condition for a sufficiency diet. It was shown that five basic conditions are decisive for the individual choices: i) the personal values of a person, ii) his or her underlying goals, ii) influences such as social environment or family, iv) personal behaviour and v) the perceived effects of this dietary behaviour on the individual and the environment.Using these defined conditions as framework, ten qualitative interviews were conducted with persons that self-declared to follow a sufficiency diet. Based on these results and the defined conditions, a typologisation has been developed, which resulted in four types of persons that follow a sufficiency diet: the Sustainable, the Healthy, the Athletic and the Conscious. The results show, that sustainability is only one of various motivations for sufficiency diets. The typologisations may help to adjust measures for promoting sufficiency diets in different target groups. Specifically, also people with little concerns for sustainability can be reached.","doc_id":11919,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6076","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Assessing and improving social compatibility","authors":"Carabias-Hütter, Vicente; Winistörfer, Herbert; Joos, Walter","subject":"Municipal solid waste management; Strategy; Sustainable solution;  Soziale Prozesse;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"303, 363","year":"2003","for_data_analysis":"Assessing and improving social compatibility; Municipal solid waste management; Strategy; Sustainable solution;  Soziale Prozesse;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Independent of technological feasibility and environmental soundness, humans are the most crucial factor in establishing sustainable behavior and new technologies.

These four reports contain a state-of-the-art analysis and analysis for the respective sub-theme, the identified gaps and give an outlook. The report is supplemented by the abstracts of some presentations given by the speakers at the Training School  (TS) in Bolzano (IT) in March  followed by articles from selected trainees of the Training School. The booklet concludes with the result from the Training School  challenge. The main question Working Group Three faced, is how a building can be built, operated and maintained in a regenerative manner. The easiest answer is that this can be achieved through integration of restorative and regenerative principles into the construction and operation process. However, the current state of the art in construction and operation do not include, or only includes partially sustainable or regenerative values. In regard to Regenerative Construction and Operation, and developing further the theoretical regenerative concepts of Working Group  and the design approaches of Working Group , a number of gaps, difficulties and opportunities become evident. Barriers can undercut a paradigm shift from the “business as usual” to a regenerative economy, making the realisation of regenerative projects difficult. The need for robust strategies to guide a transition from traditional construction process towards one which incorporates regenerative values is very clear. This publication collates the thoughts developed by the participants of Working Group Three, investigating and proposing robust approaches helping the paradigm shift, from the procurement to the operation and maintenance phases.","doc_id":12019,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17367","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Welchen neuen Regulierungsbedarf schaffen Airbnb, Uber & Co.","authors":"Abegg, Andreas; Bernauer, Christof","subject":" Öffentliches Recht (CH), Sachen-, Finanz-, Steuer- und Wirtschaftsrecht;  Privatrecht (CH)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"343, 346","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Welchen neuen Regulierungsbedarf schaffen Airbnb, Uber & Co.;  Öffentliches Recht (CH), Sachen-, Finanz-, Steuer- und Wirtschaftsrecht;  Privatrecht (CH); Die plattformbasierte Sharing Economy sorgt für kontroverse Diskussionen, insbesondere in den Bereichen der Beherbergung und des Personentransports.

For example, integration of contour conform cooling and lubrication channels into gear components can increase their service life and reduce lubricant consumption. Steels for quenching and tempering and case hardening steels are commonly used materials for gear components. However, the availability of these alloys for LPBF processing is still limited. In particular, the CrNiMo steel for quenching and tempering is frequently used for gear wheels. This specific alloy is largely unknown regarding LPBF processing and remains challenging, because of its susceptibility to cracking and the high temperature gradients that occur during the LPBF process. Therefore, this study focuses on the LPBF processing of CrNiMo powder material including process parameter evaluation and material characterization. Additionally, effects of the heat treatment on the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. Within this study the CrNiMo has been processed successfully with a density of well above .% leading to promising mechanical properties.

The method is based on reactor sampling and offline gas volume measurement during a known time interval. Important factors are biomass and liquid sampling under oxygen-free conditions, using the liquid from the reactor as substrate, providing sufficient mixing and maintaining the physical integrity of the biomass. The method was developed in such a way that small samples ( ml) were taken under anaerobic conditions (poising agent) for short-term (- min.) gas rate measurements in a small fluidized bed ( ml) batch reactor with U-tube. Biomass content was measured by an instrumental nitrogen method (Dumas), followed by weight determination of the carrier. The gas rates measured with the test system, and their dependence on substrate concentration, were in good agreement with those directly measured from the continuous fluidized bed reactor. Additions of molasses and acetate to the sample proved that the influence of concentration on the biomass activity can be obtained only by operating the continuous reactor at the concentration levels of interest. Comparison between the reactors showed large differences in the specific activity and the total reactor activity. It was found when comparing two reactors, that the values of the specific and the total activities permitted the calculation of the relative biomass quantities. In this way the influence of the carrier-type could be evaluated.","doc_id":12193,"prior":"wastewater","sdg12":1},{"id":"96","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7656","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Major technical challenges to overcome for successful exploitation of active and intelligent packaging technologies","authors":"Yildirim, Selçuk; Röcker, Bettina","subject":"Active packaging; Intelligent packaging; Smart packaging;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"664","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Major technical challenges to overcome for successful exploitation of active and intelligent packaging technologies; Active packaging; Intelligent packaging; Smart packaging;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; Active and Intelligent packaging (AIP) technologies have huge potentials to optimise the food supply chain, to better preserve the quality of the food and enhance the consciousness of the utilisation of food.

By doing so we will all help deliver better project outcomes and the full benefits of BIM, enabling us to optimise built assets in operation for users, organisations and wider society. BIM has become the chosen route for procuring and delivering new built assets. In addition, the BIM process is increasingly being applied to existing built assets. Laser scanning and other data capture techniques are being used in the digitalisation of organisations’ real estate portfolios. The collection of information/data may also be used ‘where appropriate’ to set up retrospective BIM models. If well implemented, the BIM process has the potential to deliver significant benefits not only during the design and construction phases but also during the much longer operational phase. However, the benefits need to be clearly transparent, realistic and achievable. Working with the BIM process also presents its own challenges and concerns. If we are to deliver the full benefits of BIM across all the built asset’s life cycle phases these barriers need to be addressed and overcome.

These can be seen as a mobilisation checklist of actions with supporting explanations, examples and useful links to resources for support.

To assess usual food consumption,   German speaking subjects - years of age completed a diet history interview between November  and November . With reference to the guidelines of the German Nutrition Society (DGE), NVS II observed that the German population did not eat enough foods of plant origin, especially vegetables and consumed too much of meat and meat products. While generally similar food consumption is observed in other European countries, consumption of bread, fruit juices/nectars and beer is higher in Germany. On average, men consumed two times more meat and soft drinks as well as six times more beer than women did, whereas the consumption of vegetables, fruit as well as herbal/fruit tea was higher in women. Older participants showed a lower consumption of meat, fruit juice/nectars, soft drinks and spirits as well as a higher consumption of fish, vegetables, fruit, and herbal/fruit tea than adolescents and younger adults did.

In general, the food consumption of women, the elderly and the higher SES group tends to be closer to the official dietary guidelines in Germany.","doc_id":12515,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23891","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"The first characterisation of meat consumption across sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric groups in Switzerland : results from the National Nutrition Survey menuCH","authors":"Tschanz, Linda; Kaelin, Ivo; Wróbel, Anna; Pestoni, Guilia; Rohrmann, Sabine; Herter-Aeberli, Isabelle; Sych, Janice Marie","subject":" Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"613.2, 614","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The first characterisation of meat consumption across sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric groups in Switzerland : results from the National Nutrition Survey menuCH;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; Book of Abstracts at https://www.dge.de/fileadmin/public/doc/wk//DGE-Proc-Germ-Nutr-Soc-Vol--.pdf; Background: Results from the National Nutrition Survey menuCH revealed that total meat intake exceeds the Swiss recommendation. The continuous discussion about the benefits and risks of consuming different types of meat prompted us to perform an in-depth analysis on meat intake in Switzerland. Objective: Investigation of associations of total, processed, red and white meat intake with selected sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric variables.Methods: The menuCH survey (n = , aged -), used to analyse average daily intake of total meat and main meat categories, includes data from two -h dietary recalls and an anthropometric and lifestyle questionnaire. For every meat category, we calculated energy-standardized average intake (g/ kcal) and investigated its association with  socio-demographic, lifestyle and anthropometric variables by multiple linear regression.Results: Average daily intake was  g/day of total,  g/ day of processed,  g/day of red,  g/day of white and  g/day of other meat. Energy-standardized total meat intake was highest in men, in the Italian-speaking region and in the youngest age group (- years). Significant associations with total meat intake were negative for women compared to men, but positive for age of - years compared to - years, French- and Italian- compared to German-language regions and a BMI > /m compared to a BMI of .-/m. Regression results of the three meat categories differed considerably. For example, we observed no significant difference between sexes for white meat intake, lower processed meat intake in French- than in German-language regions and higher total and processed meat intake in smokers compared to non-smokers.Conclusion: This study reveals significant differences in meat consumption with respect to amount and type in the Swiss population, suggesting that evidence-based risks and benefits of these categories might need more emphasis in meat consumption recommendations.","doc_id":12617,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"34","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5938","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Verpackung gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung","authors":"Yildirim, Selçuk","subject":"Packaging; Food waste;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"664","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Verpackung gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung; Packaging; Food waste;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","doc_id":12633,"prior":"Lebensmittelverschwendung","sdg12":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4021","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Can activites of daily living be represented by the energy consumption?","authors":"Händler-Schuster, Daniela; Zigan, Nicole; Baumann, Patrick Walter; Heinzelmann, Andreas; Imhof, Lorenz","subject":" Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"610","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Can activites of daily living be represented by the energy consumption?;  Medizin und Gesundheit","doc_id":12675,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"78","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10673","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"South African maize production : mitigating environmental impacts through solar powered irrigation","authors":"Wettstein, Sarah; Scharfy, Deborah; Berli, Cédric; von Blottnitz, Harro; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Photovoltaic; Greenhouse gas emissions; Emerging economy; Crop production;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"333, 630","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"South African maize production : mitigating environmental impacts through solar powered irrigation; Photovoltaic; Greenhouse gas emissions; Emerging economy; Crop production;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Landwirtschaft; Agriculture is among the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions.

Nicht zuletzt dank seiner Optimierungsvorschlägen und seiner Unterstützung zur Entscheidungsfindung hat er in vielen Industrieunternehmen längst Einzug gehalten. Darüber, wie die aktuelle Lage in der Schweiz und in den Unternehmen hierzulande aussieht, ist nur wenig bekannt. Deshalb soll in der vorliegenden Bachelorarbeit untersucht werden, wie verbreitet der Einsatz von digitalen Zwillingen in Unternehmen in der Schweiz derzeit ist und wie die Situation in denjenigen Firmen aussehen wird, die planen, in Zukunft digitale Zwillinge zu implementieren. Weiter wird der Frage nachgegangen, ob signifikante Zusammenhänge zwischen dem Einsatz von digitalen Zwillingen in Unternehmen und der Unternehmensgrösse, dem Unternehmensalter oder der Branchenzugehörigkeit existieren. Ebenfalls soll aufgezeigt werden, in welchen Phasen des Produktlebenszyklus digitale Zwillinge eingesetzt werden und was die Gründe für die Realisierung von Digital Twins sind. Bei den Unternehmen, welche derzeit keine digitalen Zwillinge einsetzen und dies auch zukünftig nicht beabsichtigen zu tun, stellt sich die Frage nach den Beweggründen für das mangelnde Interesse an der Implementierung. Die Forschungsfragen samt den zugehörigen Unterfragen werden anhand einer Literaturrecherche sowie einer empirischen Untersuchung beantwortet. Mittels einer Online-Umfrage wurden insgesamt  Unternehmen in der Schweiz befragt, wovon  gültig waren. Die Datenauswertung erfolgte mehrheitlich mithilfe der deskriptiven Statistik, jedoch wurde ebenfalls die Inferenzstatistik herangezogen, um mögliche Zusammenhänge zwischen den untersuchten Variablen zu eruieren. Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage zeigen, dass rund % der Befragten bereits digitale Zwillinge in ihrem Unternehmen einsetzen. Weitere % planen, diese zukünftig zu implementieren und % beabsichtigen, dies auch in ferner Zukunft nicht zu tun. Weder bei der Unternehmensgrösse noch beim Unternehmensalter konnte ein Zusammenhang mit dem Einsatz von digitalen Zwillingen in Unternehmen festgestellt werden. Anders sieht es bei der Branchenzugehörigkeit aus, so werden digitale Zwillinge in der Nahrungsmittelbranche seltener eingesetzt als im Maschinen- und Anlagenbau. Bei den befragten Unternehmen werden digitale Zwillinge am häufigsten in der ersten Phase des Produktlebenszyklus eingesetzt, der Beginning-of-Life (BoL)-Phase mit dem generellen Ziel einer Effizienzsteigerung. Der häufigste Beweggrund für eine Nichtimplementierung ist das nicht passende Geschäftsmodell. Grundsätzlich kann den Ergebnissen zufolge von einem Anstieg in Bezug auf den Einsatz von digitalen Zwillingen die Rede sein. Allerdings ist die Repräsentativität aufgrund der zu kleinen Stichprobe nicht gegeben, weshalb die Resultate mit Vorsicht betrachtet werden müssen. Als weiterer Forschungsansatz wäre demnach denkbar, eine zusätzliche repräsentative Studie durchzuführen.","doc_id":13051,"prior":"Produktlebenszyklus","sdg12":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7093","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Exoskeletons : von der akademischen Vision zur industriellen Anwendung","authors":"Stadler, Konrad","subject":" Ingenieurwesen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"620","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Exoskeletons : von der akademischen Vision zur industriellen Anwendung;  Ingenieurwesen; Roboter sind in der industriellen Produktion allgegenwärtig.

Thus, reserve times can be added to the trip times to be able to cope with delays. The times when trains enter and leave the zone are assumed to be given. The problem is then to find a track path for each train such that the timetable is conflict-free. Additionally, speed profiles should be chosen in a way that they minimise energy consumption and that most reserve times are placed towards the end of the trip to retain re-scheduling flexibility during operations. To solve the problem, the compensation zone is first divided into a small number of segments. For each train trip, the total available reserve time is computed and discretised into a number of time units. Speed profiles are then created by the distribution of these time units over the segments, resulting in a variety of alternative speed profiles. Finally, each speed profile receives a target function value considering energy consumption and reserve time placement.A graph theoretical approach is applied to find a set of conflict-free track paths that maximise the target function. By building cliques of track paths which block track resources simultaneously, tight restrictions for the ILP formulation are built. Results show that track paths can be built and assigned to several trains in half a minute.","doc_id":13081,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2479","date":"2018","language":"other","title":"Preliminarni monitoring akvaponicnega sistema v biotehniskem centru Naklo","authors":"Podgrajsek, Barbara; Schmautz, Zala; Krivograd Klemenčič, Aleksandra; Jarni, Klara; Junge, Ranka; Griessler Bulc, Tjasa","subject":"Nutrients; Aquaponics; Circulation; Vegetables;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"630","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Preliminarni monitoring akvaponicnega sistema v biotehniskem centru Naklo; Preliminary monitoring of an aquaponic system in biotechnical centre Naklo; Nutrients; Aquaponics; Circulation; Vegetables;  Landwirtschaft; Aquaponic is a recirculating food production system where fish and plants are cultivated utilizing natural bacterial cycles which convert fish waste to plant nutrients.

This research investigates the influence of hitherto unexplored psychological drivers in an attempt to generate a more holistic understanding of the phenomenon, and strategies for designing more effective consumption reduction campaigns. Using data from an internet survey of Swiss and German respondents (N = ) we investigated the role of, social norms, affect and image on water consumption. Results suggest that these psychological factors play a role in water consumption choice. Convenience was the only contextual predictor - the inconvenience of transporting bottled water has a negative effect on its consumption, and a positive effect on tap water consumption. Although concern about the effect of bottled water on the environment was not a significant predictor of tap water consumption, we found that for some people, a link exists between environmental concern and consumption choice. Ways through which consumers may be more effectively influenced towards environmentally-friendly consumption are discussed.","doc_id":13189,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"37","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16402","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Elastic scaling of cloud application performance based on Western Electric rules by injection of aspect-oriented code","authors":"Benz, Konstantin; Bohnert, Thomas M.","subject":"Cloud computing; Autoscaling; Virtualization; Elasticity; Scalability; Availability; Reliability; Performance; Western Electric rule; Statistical process control; Aspect-oriented code;  Informatik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"004","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Elastic scaling of cloud application performance based on Western Electric rules by injection of aspect-oriented code; Cloud computing; Autoscaling; Virtualization; Elasticity; Scalability; Availability; Reliability; Performance; Western Electric rule; Statistical process control; Aspect-oriented code;  Informatik; The main benefit of cloud computing lies in the elasticity of virtual resources that are provided to end users. Cloud users do not have to pay fixed hardware costs and are charged for consumption of computing resources only. While this might be an improvement for software developers who use the cloud, application users and consumers might rather be interested in paying for application performance than resource consumption. However there is little effort on providing elasticity based on performance goals instead of resource consumption. In this paper an autoscaling method is presented which aims at providing increased application performance as it is demanded by consumers. Elastic scaling is based on “statistical process monitoring and control” and “Western Electric rules”. By demonstrating the architecture of the autoscaling method and providing performance measurements gathered in an OpenStack cloud environment, we show how the injection of aspect-oriented code into cloud applications allows for improving application performance by automatically adapting the underlying virtual environment to pre-defined performance goals. The effectiveness of the autoscaling method is verified by an experiment with a test program which shows that the program executes in only half of the time which is required if no autoscaling capabilities are provided.","doc_id":13212,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14252","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Statt aufs Ofenbänkli in eine neue Selbständigkeit","authors":"Baur, Nicole Anja","subject":"Sharing Economy; Drittes Lebensalter;  Soziale Gruppen;  Arbeitsökonomie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"305, 331","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Statt aufs Ofenbänkli in eine neue Selbständigkeit; Sharing Economy; Drittes Lebensalter;  Soziale Gruppen;  Arbeitsökonomie","doc_id":13280,"prior":"Sharing Economy","sdg12":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12769","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Fostering sustainable nutrition behavior through gamification","authors":"Berger, Verena; Schrader, Ulf","subject":"Sustainable nutrition; Behavioural change; Social norms; Self-efficacy; Gamification;  Psychologie;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"150, 338.927","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Fostering sustainable nutrition behavior through gamification; Sustainable nutrition; Behavioural change; Social norms; Self-efficacy; Gamification;  Psychologie;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; The food choices consumers make have considerable consequences for the environment.

Gamification could be a possible way to encourage both self-efficacy on the part of the consumer as well as normalizing such behavior socially.

The direct-bottom mechanically driven impeller allows a large range of power inputs from . W/kg up to . W/kg, while the macro sparger seated below the three -degree elephant ear blades results in high oxygen transfer rates (kLa up to  h-) and short mixing times (minimum tM~ s).Previous studies highlighted that the critical parameters to be kept constant from one scale to another are the volumetric power input (P/V) for agitation and the superficial gas velocity (vs) for aeration. This will successfully scale up a process at a constant kLa, keeping equivalent mixing time and shear stress environment in the bioreactor. In this case study the stirred SU bioreactor Allegro STR  from PALL has been tested and compared against a conventional, cylindrically shaped SU  L bioreactor regarding the growth and the monoclonal antibody production (mAb) of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line in a chemically defined, animal‐derived component-free (ADCF) medium optimized for high‐yield protein production with a fed‐batch process intended for use in combination with specific feed supplements. Comparable results could be achieved in both stirred bioreactors. The average peak cell density at the end of the growth phase was .· cells·mL-, which correlated with a decrease in viability. The specific growth rate during the exponential growth phase was . h-. As expected, the mAb titer increased to an average level of . g·L- at the culture harvest and only small amounts of aggregates or low molecular weight species were found. This allows to conclude, that the shear stress acting on the cells under the selected process parameters does not impair the mAb quality in the AllegroTM STR .","doc_id":13534,"prior":"production process","sdg12":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6808","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A di-aromatic motif in the cytosolic tail of the mannose receptor mediates endosomal sorting","authors":"Schweizer, Anja; Stahl, Philip D.; Rohrer, Jack","subject":" Physiologie und verwandte Themen;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"571, 572","year":"2000","for_data_analysis":"A di-aromatic motif in the cytosolic tail of the mannose receptor mediates endosomal sorting;  Physiologie und verwandte Themen;  Biochemie; The mannose receptor (MR), the prototype of a new family of multilectin receptor proteins important in innate immunity, undergoes rapid internalization and recycling from the endosomal system back to the cell surface. Sorting of the MR in endosomes prevents the receptor from entering lysosomes where it would be degraded. Here, we focused on a diaromatic sequence (Tyr()-Phe()) in the MR cytoplasmic tail as an endosomal sorting signal. The subcellular distribution of chimeric constructs between the MR and the cation-dependent mannose -phosphate receptor was assessed by Percoll density gradients and cell surface assays. Unlike the wild type constructs, mutant receptors with alanine substitutions of Tyr()-Phe() were highly missorted to lysosomes, indicating that the di-aromatic motif of the MR cytoplasmic tail mediates sorting in endosomes. Within this sequence Tyr() is the key residue with Phe() contributing to this function. Moreover, Tyr() was also found to be essential for internalization, consistent with the presence of overlapping signals for internalization and endosomal sorting in the cytosolic tail of the MR. A di-aromatic amino acid sequence in the cytosolic tail has now been shown to function in two receptors known to be internalized from the plasma membrane, the MR and the cation-dependent mannose -phosphate receptor. This feature therefore appears to be a general determinant for endosomal sorting.","doc_id":13570,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22387","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Pflanzenschutz durch Reste aus der Insektenproduktion (Frass) gegen bodenbürtige Pilzpathogene","authors":"Panov, Jovan","subject":"Frass; Food from Wood; FfW; Hermetia illucens; Schwarze Soldatenfliege; Tenebrio molitor; Mehlwurm; Trypoxylus dichotomus; Hirschkäfer; Chitin; Chitinase; Topfsubstrat; Lactuca sativa var. capitata; Kopfsalat; Lepidium sativum; Gartenkresse; Pythium ultimum; Rhizoctonia solani; Verticillium dahliae;  Pflanzenkrankheiten, Schädlinge","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"632","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Pflanzenschutz durch Reste aus der Insektenproduktion (Frass) gegen bodenbürtige Pilzpathogene; Frass; Food from Wood; FfW; Hermetia illucens; Schwarze Soldatenfliege; Tenebrio molitor; Mehlwurm; Trypoxylus dichotomus; Hirschkäfer; Chitin; Chitinase; Topfsubstrat; Lactuca sativa var. capitata; Kopfsalat; Lepidium sativum; Gartenkresse; Pythium ultimum; Rhizoctonia solani; Verticillium dahliae;  Pflanzenkrankheiten, Schädlinge; Durch den wachsenden Bedarf an hochwertigem und umweltfreundlich produziertem Protein nimmt die Insektenproduktion auch in Europa zu. Dadurch werden vermehrt Produktionsreste bestehend aus Insektenexkrementen (Frass), Insektenhäuten (Chitin) und Futterresten anfallen. Der Verwertung von diesem Abfallstoff als Düngemittel oder Substratzusatz wird deshalb grosses Interesse geschenkt. Die potentielle Wirkung gegen Pflanzenpathogene ist durch den Chitingehalt im Frass vielversprechend. Chitin ist bekannt dafür, chitinolytische Mikroorganismen im Boden zu fördern, welche durch lytische Enzyme wie Chitinase chitinhaltige pflanzenparasitische Pilze oder Nematoden bekämpfen.In dieser Arbeit wurde der Frass von drei Insektenarten zur Eignung als Substratzusatz sowie auf die Wirkung gegen bodenbürtige Pilzpathogene getestet. In einem ersten Kressetest (Lepidium sativum) wurde die Wirkung von % und % Frass von Trypoxylus dichotomus in Substrat gegen Pythium ultimum untersucht. Im zweiten Kressetest wurde der Einfluss der Mikroorganismen durch Sterilisation und Inkubation des Frass-Substrat-Gemisches und in einem dritten Kressetest zusätzlich die Wirkung von Tenebrio molitor und Hermetia illucens gegen P. ultimum geprüft. In einem Topfversuch wurde die Wirkung des Frasses von Trypoxylus dichotomus und Tenebrio molitor an Kopfsalat (Lactuca sativa var. capitata) gegen Rhizoctonia solani und Verticillium dahliae getestet. Während der Versuchsdauer wurden die Chitinaseaktivität und die Anzahl an chitinolytischen Bakterien im Substrat ermittelt.In den ersten beiden Kressetests konnte der Frass von Trypoxylus dichotomus den Befall durch P. ultimum signifikant unterdrücken. Die Inkubation des Substrats verschlechterte die Wirkung und die Sterilisation hatte einen kompletten Befall zur Folge. Im dritten Kressetest und im Topfversuch haben die Pilze eine zu geringe Infektiosität aufgewiesen, wodurch keine Krankheitssymptome ausgewertet werden konnten. Die Negativkontrolle wies das stärkste Wachstum im Topfversuch auf. % Frass von Trypoxylus dichotomus bewirkte anfänglich ein verzögertes Wachstum. % Zugabe des Frasses von Tenebrio molitor bewirkte das Absterben der Pflanzen, jedoch konnten im Substrat eine signifikant höhere Chitinaseaktivität und grössere Anzahl an chitinolytischen Bakterien im Substrat beobachtet werden.Die unterschiedlichen Nährstoffgehalte im Frass der verschiedenen Insektenarten und deren differente Produktionsbedingungen erschweren eine allgemeine Empfehlung zur Anwendung von Frass. Für eine Wirkung gegen Pflanzenpathogene muss die Menge an zugesetztem Frass so angepasst sein, dass genügend nützliche Mikroorganismen wie chitinolytische Bakterien gefördert werden und das Pflanzenwachstum nicht beeinträchtigt wird.The mass rearing of insects in Europe is increasing due to the rising demand for high quality and environmentally friendly protein. The accumulating residues, as a mixture of insect excrements (frass), exuvie (chitin) and feeding substrate, can potentially be used as a fertilizer or as a potting substrate amendment. Plant protection against soiborne pathogens can be a promising application of frass, because of the Chitin content. Chitin is known to promote chitinolytic microorganisms in soil and induces the activity of Chitinase, which is a lytic enzym, that degrades the cell walls of plant parasitic fungi and the egg shells of nematodes.In this thesis, the frass of three different insect species have been analysed for application as a substrate amendment and for the suppression of soilborne fungal pathogens. Frass of Trypoxylus dichotomus, Tenebrio molitor and Hermetia illucens have been tested for suppression against Pythium ultimum on garden cress (Lepidium sativum). The impact of incubation and sterilisation of the substrat-frass mixture of Trypoxylus dichotomus against P. ultimum has been tested as well. In a pot experiment frass of Trypoxylus dichotomus und Tenebrio molitor have been evaluated for the suppression of Rhizoctonia solani and Verticillium dahliae on lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. capitata). Measurements of chitinase-activity and the CFU of chitinolytic bacteria in the soil have been made throughout the experiment.The concentration of % and % Frass of Trypoxylus dichotomus in potting substrate was able to suppress P. ultimum significantly. Incubation of the substrate resulted in less suppression and sterilisation resulted in total infection of the plants. In the third experiment on cress and in the potting experiment no symptoms of desease could be evaluated, due to low infectiousness of the inoculated pathogens. Highest growing rates of lettuce was observed without frass. % of frass from Tenebrio molitor resulted in death of the plants but had a significant enhancement effect on chitinase-activity and on CFU of chitinolytic bacteria.Frass of different insect species and production sites show different nutrient contents and chemical properties, wich make a general recommendation for the application of frass difficult. On the one hand enough frass has to be applied to support beneficial microorganisms for the suppression of plant pathogens and on the other hand the amount has to be limited for the prevention of phytotoxicity.","doc_id":13603,"prior":"Verwertung","sdg12":1},{"id":"74","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1321","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Highly efficient 3rd generation multi-junction solar cells using silicon heterojunction and perovskite tandem : prospective life cycle environmental impacts","authors":"Itten, René; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"LCA; Life Cycle Assessment; Prospective; Photovoltaics; PV; Multi-junction; Perovskite; Silicon heterojunction; Tandem; Electricity; Greenhouse gas emission; Carbon footprint;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"621.3","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Highly efficient rd generation multi-junction solar cells using silicon heterojunction and perovskite tandem : prospective life cycle environmental impacts; LCA; Life Cycle Assessment; Prospective; Photovoltaics; PV; Multi-junction; Perovskite; Silicon heterojunction; Tandem; Electricity; Greenhouse gas emission; Carbon footprint;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; In this study, the environmental impacts of monolithic silicon heterojunction organometallic perovskite tandem cells (SHJ-PSC) and single junction organometallic perovskite solar cells (PSC) are compared with the impacts of crystalline silicon based solar cells using a prospective life cycle assessment with a time horizon of .

Interaction effects with mineral oil taxes reduce carbon taxes on motor fuels and transport externalities increase them. We show that the cost-effective overall carbon tax on motor fuels should be lower than the one on thermal fuels. This is found in spite of the fact that pre-existing taxes on motor fuels are well below our estimate of the transport externality per unit of transport fuel consumption. Differentiating taxes in favor of motor fuels yields only slightly more equitable incidence effects among households, suggesting that equity considerations play a minor role when designing differentiated carbon pricing policies.","doc_id":13711,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18402","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Couples’ construction of boundaries of risk and responsibility during pregnancy","authors":"Radu, Irina; Gouilhers, Solène; Hammer, Raphaël; Meyer, Yvonne; Pehlke-Milde, Jessica","subject":" Sozialwissenschaften;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"300, 618","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Couples’ construction of boundaries of risk and responsibility during pregnancy;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; From a public health perspective, alcohol has been constructed as an important risk factor for fetal health during the pregnancy period. This is reflected in public health guidelines, which in many European countries advise abstinence during pregnancy. Women’s own perceptions of alcohol as risk during pregnancy however, are varied and practices range from abstinence to occasional or regular alcohol consumption. In our study, which focuses on expecting couples living in Switzerland, we aim to understand the way that pregnant women and their male partners perceive this risk and how they construct the boundaries between “harmful”, “risky” and “safe” daily habits. To this end, we used a rare methodological set-up among studies on risk and pregnancy: we conducted separate interviews with both partners of  couples, in the Lausanne and Zurich areas.Based on a thematic analysis, our findings indicate that pregnancy is a transition period during which boundaries around health risk-assessment emerge within the couple, with women tending to take on the responsibility for the fetus’s health, seeking information on everything from prenatal screenings to diet and alcohol consumption. We identified three ideal-types concerning women’s risk perception and alcohol consumption during pregnancy, with the women’s information-seeking behavior playing an important part in shaping risk perception. Furthermore, we found that male partners take on a supportive role during this stage, enforcing the women’s strategies of risk diminution – a dynamic, which can lead to an early solidification of gender roles in child rearing.","doc_id":13715,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"51","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24898","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Change in alcohol consumption and binge drinking in university students during the early COVID-19 pandemic","authors":"Zysset, Annina; Volken, Thomas; Amendola, Simone; von Wyl, Agnes; Dratva, Julia","subject":"Pandemie; Gesundheitsverhalten; Alkoholkonsum; Studierendengesundheit; Risky health behavior; Alcohol; Binge drinking; Anxiety; Student; Emerging adulthood; COVID-19; Lockdown;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"305, 616.8","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Change in alcohol consumption and binge drinking in university students during the early COVID- pandemic; Pandemie; Gesundheitsverhalten; Alkoholkonsum; Studierendengesundheit; Risky health behavior; Alcohol; Binge drinking; Anxiety; Student; Emerging adulthood; COVID-; Lockdown;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems; Objectives: Young adults have been overly affected by the containment measures against COVID- and, consequently, worsening in mental health and change in health behavior have been reported. Because the life phase of emerging adulthood is crucial for developing health behaviors, this study aims to examine increase in alcohol consumption, single and multiple binge drinking, and associated factors in students during lockdown and post-lockdown periods.Methods: A prospective open cohort study design with nine survey time points between April  and June  was conducted. The present study uses pooled data from the first survey T ( April to  April) and follow-ups at T ( April to  May ) and T ( May to  June ). Students from all faculties of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) (N = ’) were invited.

Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models were used to investigate the factors associated with increases in alcohol consumption based on number of occasions/last  days; drinks/week, and binge drinking at T, and respective changes at T and T (increases, decreases, no change).Results: Overall, % of Swiss university students reported an increased alcohol consumption and % engaged in binge drinking. Number of drinks at baseline was associated with a higher probability of increased alcohol consumption, as well as engaging in single and multiple binge drinking events. Higher anxiety scores were associated with a higher probability to increase the alcohol consumption and engaging at least once in binge drinking. Additional factors associated with any binge drinking were male gender, younger age and not living with parents. Higher perceived social support was only associated with engaging in heavy binge drinking.Conclusions: A substantial number of students developed a more risky health behavior regarding alcohol consumption. It is important to identify at risk students and design target prevention including factors such as age, gender and social norms. Further, health behavior and determinants of health behaviors of students should be carefully monitored during the further course of the pandemic.","doc_id":13893,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"53","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16583","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Intelligent products-service systems : online monitoring services in the European tooling Industry","authors":"Oschmann, Georg; Scherrer, Maike; Schittny, Bastian","subject":"Service portfolio; Product service system; Tooling industry; Online monitoring;  Allgemeines Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Intelligent products-service systems : online monitoring services in the European tooling Industry; Service portfolio; Product service system; Tooling industry; Online monitoring;  Allgemeines Management; Today’s turbulent economic environment confronts the European tooling industry with new challenges: strategic differentiation via cost-leadership has not worked out for European toolmakers over the last years. Other industries have shown a promising approach for creating competitive advantages over competitors and higher profitability by enhancing the existing range of products with customer-specific services. An intelligent bundling of individual services with the core product leads to so-called hybrid products or product-service-systems. These systems not only ensure the proper functioning of the product but also increase efficiency and effectiveness of the customer's processes. Even though, the concept of product-service-systems is well known, few concepts exist, which build a holistic focus on products and services from a developers point of view. In order to apply the idea of moving into the service business to the tooling industry we set up a study on product-service systems in the tooling industry. As other European manufacturers as well, players in the tooling industry face an increasing market pressure from international competitors. One solution to remain competitive is to focus on delivering knowledge intensive products and services This research paper's goal is to develop an empirically based portfolio for future product-service systems and is embedded in a larger European study. The overall study is funded by the seventh framework program of the EU and has the goal to integrate the customer and developer perspectives in developing product-service-systems.

By probing the near surface region of a sensor area with the evanescent field, any change of the refractive index of the probed volume induces a phase shift of the guided mode compared to a reference field typically of a mode propagating through the reference arm of the same waveguide structure. The interfering fields of these modes produce an interference signal detected at the sensor׳s output, whose alteration is proportional to the refractive index change. This signal can be recorded, processed and related to e.g. the concentration of an analyte in the solution of interest. Although this sensing principle is relatively simple, studies about integrated planar optical waveguide interferometer biosensors can mostly be found in the literature covering the past twenty years. During these two decades, several members of this sensor family have been introduced, which have remarkably advantageous properties. These entail label-free and non-destructive detection, outstandingly good sensitivity and detection limit, cost-effective and simple production, ability of multiplexing and miniaturization. Furthermore, these properties lead to low reagent consumption, short analysis time and open prospects for point-of-care applications.

On average, meatless meals had more than a % reduction in environmental impacts than meat-containing meals for any of the assessed indicators (carbon footprint, water use, resource consumption, health impacts of pollution, and ecosystem quality). At maximum and minimum for carbon footprint, meat-containing dinners were associated with  kgCOe and meatless lunches  kg COe. Results indicate that, on average in the US, meatless meals lessen environmental impacts in comparison to meat-containing meals; however, animal products (i.e., dairy) in meatless meals also had a substantial impact. Findings suggest that industrial interventions focusing on low-impact meat substitutes for dinners and thereafter lunches, and low-impact dairy substitutes for breakfasts, offer large opportunities for improving the environmental performance of the average diet.","doc_id":14008,"prior":"carbon footprint","sdg12":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17262","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Ressourcenschonendes Handeln im Alltag möglichst einfach gestalten : das Potential von Nudging","authors":"Miesler, Linda","subject":"Nudging; Nachhaltiges Konsumverhalten;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Ressourcenschonendes Handeln im Alltag möglichst einfach gestalten : das Potential von Nudging; Nudging; Nachhaltiges Konsumverhalten;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","doc_id":14030,"prior":"Konsumverhalten","sdg12":1},{"id":"20","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/25039","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Antibiotic resistance in high and low nucleic acid content bacteria","authors":"Erb, Severin","subject":"Antibiotics; Antibiotic resistance; Drinking water; Drinking water treatment; HNA and LNA content bacteria;  Mikrobiologie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"579, 615","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Antibiotic resistance in high and low nucleic acid content bacteria; Antibiotics; Antibiotic resistance; Drinking water; Drinking water treatment; HNA and LNA content bacteria;  Mikrobiologie;  Pharmakologie und Therapeutik; This study focused on the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in «high nucleic acid (HNA) content bacteria» and «low nucleic acid (LNA) content bacteria» in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) with different water sources and treatment steps, and bacterial regrowth within their distribution systems (DWDSs). The aim was to identify potential associations of HNA and LNA content bacteria with antibiotic resistance indicator genes – the class  integron-integrase gene intI and the ARG sul. In addition, drinking water facilities with few or no treatment steps were examined to assess whether they could potentially pose a higher risk in case of ARGs or bacterial regrowth and to obtain information on the extent to which flow cytometry (FCM) can contribute to the assessment of microbial risk factors in drinking water. Water samples from three larger and three smaller DWTPs in Switzerland were filtered on . μm and . μm filter membranes to investigate HNA and LNA cells with FCM and additionally, to compare the frequency of IntI and sul in HNA and LNA content bacteria with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR). Furthermore, real-time qPCR was used for S rRNA to monitor bacterial regrowth. FCM proved to be a rapid method for detection and separation of HNA and LNA cells in water samples and will be a good method in further drinking water studies. However, it should be mentioned that FCM will not reveal any effect in UV disinfection, which could give a false impression of the effectiveness of this treatment step. Interestingly, the ARG sul has never been detected with real-time qPCR in previously treated samples, whereas it could be detected in river water samples with higher HNA content bacteria. Furthermore, the relative abundances compared to S rRNA and the proportions in bacteria with HNA and LNA content showed higher frequencies of intI and sul in bacteria with HNA content than in LNA content bacteria. Moreover, considering ARGs - when comparing the proportions of gene copies per cell in HNA and LNA content bacteria - it generally resulted that LNA content bacteria had less than % of them. These results showed a potential for the possibility that a minimum genome size for carrying an ARG could exist. However, a potentially higher risk of ARGs was not observed in drinking water systems with fewer or no treatment steps, although it was found that the most effective treatment step to reduce HNA content bacteria is by infiltration of surface water into groundwater. In the future, however, these results would need to be further investigated in other studies aiming for a wider range of ARGs.","doc_id":14054,"prior":"water treatment","sdg12":1},{"id":"58","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17667","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"European Union gas market development","authors":"Baltensperger, Tobias; Füchslin, Rudolf M.; Krütli, Pius; Lygeros, John","subject":"Natural gas; Computational market equilibrium; European market outlook; Social welfare analysis; Linear complementarity program; Market power;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"European Union gas market development; Natural gas; Computational market equilibrium; European market outlook; Social welfare analysis; Linear complementarity program; Market power;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; The recently announced Energy Union by the European Commission is the most recent step in a series of developments aiming at integrating the European Union's (EU) gas markets in order to increase social welfare and security of gas supply. Based on simulations with a spatial partial equilibrium model, we analyze the changes in consumption, prices, and social welfare up to  induced by the infrastructure expansions planned for this period, for the current market, as well as for three hypothetical scenarios: a halt of Russian gas deliveries to the EU during the winter period (RU-); a simultaneous doubling of available LNG (LNG+); and for Brexit, in which the United Kingdom market is isolated from the EU. In the case of the current market, the new infrastructure leads to a slight decrease of wholesale prices. Moreover, the potential of suppliers to exert market power decreases significantly, particularly in the Baltic states and Finland which are the most exposed countries today, and consumer surplus increases by .% in the EU. In the RU- scenario, consumer surplus decreases across Europe, with the largest losses occurring in the Baltic states, as well as in Finland, Poland and Romania. In the LNG+ scenario, the gains in consumer surplus are primarily found in Western Europe. However, the planned infrastructure expansions distribute the gains and losses in consumer surplus more evenly over all EU member states, with the exception of Romania. In the Brexit scenario, consumer surplus decreases by up to .% in the United Kingdom, .% in Ireland, and .% in the other EU countries. Our results allow us to distinguish three categories of projects: (i) Change in gas availability, leading to a general increase or decrease of social welfare all over the EU. The only project increasing social welfare in all scenarios in most countries is the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP); (ii) existing gas sources made available to additional countries. This leads to an increase of social welfare in the newly connected countries, while social welfare drops slightly everywhere else; (iii) projects with a marginal effect on the market. Most notably, the recently announced Turkish Stream falls into this category. Our results indicate that if all proposed infrastructure projects are realized, the EU's single market will become a reality in  when Finland is interconnected to the EU markets. However, we also find that social welfare can only be increased significantly for the EU as a whole if new gas sources become accessible. At the same time, efficiency gains, albeit decreasing social welfare, help to improve the situation of consumers and decrease the dependency of the EU as a whole on external suppliers.","doc_id":14090,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20004","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Organisational factors, anticipated rents and commercialisation in SMEs","authors":"Do, Hang; Mazzarol, Tim; Soutar, Goeffrey N.; Volery, Thierry; Reboud, Sophie","subject":"Commercialisation; Innovation; Organisational factor; SMEs;  Leitendes Management","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"658.4","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Organisational factors, anticipated rents and commercialisation in SMEs; Commercialisation; Innovation; Organisational factor; SMEs;  Leitendes Management; The study investigates the relationship between organisational factors and the anticipated returns to the commercialisation of an innovation within small to medium enterprises (SMEs).

At the same time, it fulfills all constraints in terms of the limits on power allowed to be taken from the grid. For the user, besides the optimal scheduling of household appliances and selling energy to the grid whenever it becomes profitable, the developed prototype gives also the opportunity to monitor the local generation, storage and consumption in real time. On the other side, the electric utility can produce a real-time pricing signal which reflects daily peaks in consumption. Making such a price signal available for this building energy management system will lead to a decrease of power consumption from the grid.

Data from the German Income and Expenditure Survey (EVS) is applied to the EEG surcharge to show its effect on different household types. We show that those groups with the largest consumption of electricity often face the smallest relative burden due to the EEG surcharge, as they can compensate with their relatively large income. Groups with little discretionary income, such as low-income households, the unemployed and single parents face the highest relative burden, although the amounts they consume are not large in absolute terms. In light of our findings, we review the provisions relating to energy expenditures in the German social security system. We then go on to examine the main energy efficiency policies that are implemented and planned in Germany relating to buildings and electricity consumption/appliances. Results indicate that those policies do have the potential to reduce the burden imposed by the EEG surcharge. Furthermore, the combined effect of the EEG surcharge and those policies turns out to be nearly proportional. On the one hand, this shows that energy efficiency measures are not only relevant climate and energy policy instruments, but can also serve distributional goals. On the other hand, we highlight that the result regarding their positive distributional effects only holds if indeed these measures are taken up also by low-income households. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the beneficiaries of energy efficiency measures in the evaluation of these policies and if necessary design more targeted approaches.","doc_id":14470,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"77","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21651","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Energy efficiency gap in Switzerland : an empirical study on online purchases of white goods","authors":"Stadelmann, Marcel","subject":"Discounting; Energy efficiency gap; Purchase decision; White goods;  Energie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"333.79","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Energy efficiency gap in Switzerland : an empirical study on online purchases of white goods; Discounting; Energy efficiency gap; Purchase decision; White goods;  Energie; An energy efficiency gap implies that purchases of more energy-efficient equipment result in monetary (and energy) savings.

Hereby, it takes advantage of the unique characteristics of “twin” products – i.e., two products sharing identical characteristics except for their energy efficiency and their purchase price. The energy efficiency gap requires two conditions to be met: First, the energy-efficient twin has to have a lower present value of total costs than its inefficient counterpart, and second, the inefficient twin has to be purchased nonetheless. In an empirical analysis of the Swiss online market for twin white goods, this chapter illustrates cases meeting both conditions for different discount rates. Based on these cases, the size of the respective energy efficiency gap is calculated. The energy efficiency gap is measured by the relative difference between the mean annual electricity consumption of the products actually purchased and the mean annual electricity consumption of products hypothetically purchased by fully rational economic agents. It seems that for reasonable discount rates the energy efficiency gap is rather small. One key reason seems to be the generally high purchase price premium of energy-efficient appliances.","doc_id":14587,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22141","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Sustainable antimicrobial packaging technologies","authors":"Yildirim, Selçuk; Röcker, Bettina","subject":"Packaging; Food packaging; Antimicrobial packaging; Active packaging; Biopackaging; Sustainable packaging;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"664","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Sustainable antimicrobial packaging technologies; Packaging; Food packaging; Antimicrobial packaging; Active packaging; Biopackaging; Sustainable packaging;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; In the food packaging sector, innovative packaging technologies have been developed including active packaging.

In the present study we investigated these questions by asking office occupants about (a) their energy related behavior, (b) reasons for suboptimal energy related consumption and (c) their knowledge of energy efficient behavior in office buildings. occupants working in  office buildings participated in an online survey. The results show that up to  per cent of occupants report bringing personal electronic devices to the workplace. Around  per cent of the occupants have manipulated ventilation ducts in their work area in order to optimize their comfort. The study shows that the main reasons for not acting energy efficiently are not attitudes or goals. They relate to a lack of information, lack of incentives, and habits. This finding is further supported by the survey participants’ statements about the three most effective actions occupants can take to reduce energy consumption in the building. The most cited action taken by respondents to reduce energy consumption was to switch off lights when they were not required.  There were a number of more effective energy efficiency measures that were not cited frequently (such as reducing heating), indicating a lack of awareness.It is recommended that organizations implement awareness and feedback systems tailored to organizational practices in order to change occupant’s habits.

Doch für die Produktion wird eine hohe Menge an Ressourcen und Energie benötigt, welches zu einer Umweltbelastung führt. Mit einer Verlängerung der Nutzungs- sowie der Lebensdauer der Geräte kann die Abfallerzeugung sowie der Ressourcen- und Energieverbrauch minimiert und die Kreislaufeffizienz erhöht werden, welches im gesamten die Umweltbelastung reduziert. Die Verlängerung der Nutzungs- sowie Lebensdauer können durch Massnahmen, wie das Teilen, der Wiederverwendung, das Reparieren und der Wiederaufbereitung erzielt werden.Die vorliegende Thesis untersucht den Entscheidungsprozess der Reparaturshops bei einem Reparaturfall in der Deutschschweiz. Dabei werden autorisierte sowie nicht autorisierte Reparaturstellen in Betracht gezogen. Durch die gesamtheitliche Betrachtung des Entscheidungsprozesses werden Kriterien für die Beurteilung der Reparierbarkeit sowie Limitationen bei der Durchführbarkeit einer Reparatur eruiert. Gleichzeitig wird beim Beratungsprozess untersucht, ob und welche Empfehlungen den Kundinnen und Kunden durch die Reparaturshops gemacht werden. Abschliessend werden dabei die Unterschiede zwischen den autorisierten und nicht autorisierten Reparaturshops dargestellt. Um diese forschungsleitenden Fragen zu beantworten, wurden Interviews mit acht Expertinnen und Experten aus dem Reparaturbereich durchgeführt.Die Erkenntnisse aus den Interviews zeigen, dass bei der Bewertung der Reparierbarkeit die Kundenentscheidung, die Kostensicht, Garantie und Versicherung, diverse Richtlinien, die Durchlaufzeit sowie das Kriterium der Verlängerung der Nutzungs- und Lebensdauer beachtet werden. Die Reparierbarkeit wird jedoch von internen und externen Limitationen beeinträchtigt. Des Weiteren werden die Kundinnen und Kunden von allen befragten Reparaturshops beraten und erhalten entsprechende Empfehlungen. Dabei werden die Investitionsmöglichkeiten für Neugeräte oder wiederaufbereitete Mobiltelefone aufgezeigt. Auch werden die Nutzerinnen und Nutzer durch die Reparaturshops mit Bedienungshilfen unterstützt, wobei in einigen Fällen auch Reparaturen somit umgangen werden können. Zwischen den autorisierten und nicht autorisierten Reparaturshops sind ebenfalls Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Garantie, der Qualität, der Wahrnehmung durch die Kundinnen und Kunden sowie der Durchlaufzeit zu beobachten.Die Verlängerung der Nutzungs- und Lebensdauer der Mobiltelefone können durch Reparaturen gefördert werden und dies führt zur Reduktion der Umweltbelastung.

Beim Einsatz von Wärmepumpen kommen thermische Speicher, sowohl auf der Primär-als auch auf der Sekundärseite, infrage. In dieser Arbeit wird die Optimierung eines Speichers auf der Primärseite als Wärmequelle für die Wärmepumpe untersucht. Solche Speicher müssen viel Wärme im Temperaturbereich von  bis  °C speichern können, damit die Wärmepumpe bei hohen Leistungszahlen betrieben werden kann. Dafür eignen sich Speicher mit Phasenwechselmaterialien (PCM; engl. phase change material), sogenannte PCM-Speicher. In diesem Temperaturbereich kann in einem PCM-Speicher ca.  % mehr Wärme als in einem gleich grossen sensiblen Speicher gespeichert werden. PCM-Speicher weisen jedoch eine geringere Lade- und Entladeleistung als sensible Speicher auf, wodurch die höhere Wärmekapazität von PCM-Speichern bei ungünstiger Auslegung nicht genutzt wird.Um die zusätzliche Wärmekapazität von PCM-Speichern zu nutzen, muss der PCM-Speicher abhängig von verschiedenen Einflüssen ausgelegt werden. Dafür muss das Speicherverhalten von PCM-Speichern sowie die Einflüsse der Parameter verstanden werden. Für dieses Verständnis wurde in dieser Arbeit ein Simulationsmodell eines PCM-Speichers mit kugelförmig verkapseltem Phasenwechselmaterial entwickelt. Beim untersuchten PCM-Speicher erfolgt der Wärmeübergang zwischen PCM und Wärmetransportfluid (HTF; engl. heat transport fluid) durch die Umströmung der PCM-Kugeln.Die Simulationen bestätigten grundsätzlich das aus der Literatur bekannte Verhalten. Der Wärmeübergang zwischen PCM und HTF steigt mit höherer Wärmeleitfähigkeit des PCMs degressiv, bei kleineren PCM-Radien progressiv und bei steigender Durchflussgeschwindigkeit im Speicher proportional. Ein grösserer Wärmeübergang verbessert das Lade- und Entladeverhalten in jedem Fall. Bei einer zu hohen Wärmekapazität kann der Speicher nicht vollständig geladen werden, wodurch im Speicher tiefere Temperaturen vorliegen und die Leistungsentnahme gesenkt wird. Über die Fülldichte kann definiert werden, wie viel Wärme bei hoher Leistung entnommen werden kann. Bei tiefer Fülldichte kann mehr Wärme bei hoher Leistung entnommen werden als bei hoher Fülldichte. Auch die gewählten Temperaturbereiche beeinflussten das Speicherverhalten. Bei tiefen Schmelztemperaturen des PCMs, kann der PCM-Speicher schneller geladen, aber dafür langsamer entladen werden.Zur Entscheidung in welchen Wärmesystemen welche PCM-Parameter zu bevorzugen sind, sollte das Wärmesystem über ein Jahr simuliert werden.; Abstract:Energy storage systems allow to use renewable energy whenever needed. In heat pump systems thermal storage can be used on both, the primary and secondary, sides. In this paper, the optimization of a storage tank on the primary side is researched as a heat source for the heat pump. Such storages need a high heat capacity in temperature ranges from  to  °C in order to operate at a high coefficient of performance (COP). Suitable for this purpose are storages with phase change materials (PCM), so-called PCM-storage. In this temperature range, approx.  % more heat can be stored in a PCM-storage than in a sensitive storage of the same size. However, PCM-storages have a lower charging and discharging capacity than sensitive storages, therefore the higher heat capacity of the PCM-storage is not used if the design is inappropriate.The PCM-storage must be designed depending on various influences, in order to use the additional heat capacity of it. For this reason, the storage behaviour of PCM-storages and the influences of the parameters must be understood. In this thesis, a simulation model of a PCMstorage with spherically encapsulated phase change material was developed. In the researched PCM-storage, the heat transfer between PCM and heat transport fluid (HTF) occurs through the flow around the PCM spheres.The simulations basically confirmed the behaviour known from the literature. The heat exchange between PCM and HTF increases degressively with higher thermal conductivity of the PCM, progressively with smaller PCM radii and proportionally with increasing flow velocity in the storage tank. The increase in heat transfer improves the storage behaviour. If the heat capacity is too high, the storage tank cannot be fully charged, resulting in lower temperatures in the storage. Due to the lower temperatures in the storage, the power consumption is reduced. The filling density can be used to define how much heat can be extracted at high output. More heat can be extracted at high power and at low filling density than at high filling density. The selected temperature ranges also influenced the storage behaviour. At low melting temperatures of the PCM, the PCM-storage can be charged faster, but discharged slower.The heating system should be simulated over a one-year period, in order to decide, which parameters are to be preferred with it.","doc_id":15093,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23547","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"How to efficiently shake viscous culture broths","authors":"Meister, Jolanda; Maschke, Rüdiger; Werner, Sören; Eibl, Dieter; John, Gernot T.","subject":"Shake flask; Thomson Optimum Growth; kLa; Viscosity;  Biotechnologie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"660.6","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"How to efficiently shake viscous culture broths; Shake flask; Thomson Optimum Growth; kLa; Viscosity;  Biotechnologie; In biotechnology, the use of shake flasks is widespread due to their easy handling, especially in process design and optimization as well as in small-scale upstream processing and inoculum production.

To support this shift, the rapid development of digital technologies for measuring and communicating home energy use has been a relevant step. A multitude of studies have investigated the effectiveness of smart phone apps and smart meters, in particular, and found some success in achieving behaviour change with this approach (Chatzigeorgiou and Andreou ). However, barriers remain in effectively addressing the everyday lives of consumers as digital tools must match an individuals’ ability to understand, use and capture the value from these tools, i.e. digital literacy (Eshet ). Furthermore, the emergence of new energy consumption practices at home may be more effective when integrated into the wider system of real-world practices households are already engaged in (Darby ).Within the scope of redesigning a smart phone app for household energy savings, a co-creation approach was used to better understand the energy and technology literacy, motivations, needs regarding the kind of information feedback, and concerns of consumers. Co-creation, as a reflexive design approach, highlights important design considerations from the perspective of the users, and thus improves the researchers’ and designers’ ability to address engagement challenges before the final implementation (Itten et al. ).This paper outlines the method for co-creating an energy saving app and behavioural intervention with household members and explores the process to answer the questions:- What does the co-creation process contribute to an energy savings app and accompanying behaviour intervention design?- Who takes part in voluntary co-creation process for an energy savings app?- Does the co-creation process have an impact on participant's energy awareness, self-efficacy and attitude?","doc_id":15266,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"10","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10565","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The Generation Z and the environmental impact of their digital media behaviour","authors":"Itten, René; Keller, Regula; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"LCA; Digital devices; Adolescents; Environmental impact; CED; Digital media; Cell phone;  Soziale Interaktion;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"302, 338.927","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"The Generation Z and the environmental impact of their digital media behaviour; LCA; Digital devices; Adolescents; Environmental impact; CED; Digital media; Cell phone;  Soziale Interaktion;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Oral presentation; Introduction: the use of digital media has become an integral part of our everyday life.

These sectors contribute to about % of the final energy consumption and nearly % of the greenhouse gas emissions. In order to meet the Kyoto emission targets in , the Swiss government employs a broad mix of different policy measures. The measures include both price-based instruments, such as emissions trading and the CO levy, and non-price-based instruments, such as binding emission targets or building codes. Emission trading is mandatory for companies passing a certain emission threshold. Other measures, such as the commitment to a target agreement, are optional and allow for an exemption of the CO levy. Companies thus face both, compulsory and non-compulsory policies with different incentives to reduce energy consumption. To test the impact of these energy policies on energy consumption, we use a unique and representative sample of ' firms of the industry and service sector of Switzerland, covering the years  to . The survey is conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy and includes yearly observations of final firm energy consumption, as well as firm characteristics. The CO levy is imposed on fossil heating and process fuels and has been increased from an initial rate of CHF  per tonne of COeq emitted in  to CHF  per tonne of COeq in . We analyse policy changes, such as increasing the CO tax, with binary variables indicating a treatment. An unobserved effects regression model with firm fixed effects is applied to identify the policy effects and to isolate them from time-independent, unobserved firm-specific factors. Time trends allow us to capture e.g. technological progress. Controlling for other effects such as economic sector, heating degree days or the growth rate of the economy, we are able to conclude that Switzerland's energy and climate policy has a significant impact on the energy consumption in the industry and service sector.","doc_id":15467,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19744","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Laser powder bed fusion of 30CrNiMo8 steel for quenching and tempering : examination of the processability and mechanical properties","authors":"Zumofen, Livia; Kirchheim, Andreas; Dennig, Hans-Jörg","subject":"Additive Manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; 30CrNiMo8; Steel for quenching and tempering;  Industrielle und handwerkliche Fertigung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"670","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Laser powder bed fusion of CrNiMo steel for quenching and tempering : examination of the processability and mechanical properties; Additive Manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; CrNiMo; Steel for quenching and tempering;  Industrielle und handwerkliche Fertigung; The layer-by-layer principle of additive manufacturing technology laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) opens up completely new possibilities in the design and manufacturing of lightweight and efficient gear components. For example, integration of contour conform cooling and lubrication channels into gear components can increase their service life and reduce lubricant consumption. Steels for quenching and tempering and case hardening steels are commonly used materials for gear components. However, the availability of these alloys for LPBF processing is still limited. In particular, the CrNiMo steel for quenching and tempering is frequently used for gear wheels. This specific alloy is largely unknown regarding LPBF processing and remains challenging, because of its susceptibility to cracking and the high temperature gradients that occur during the LPBF process. Therefore, this study focuses on the LPBF processing of CrNiMo powder material including process parameter evaluation and material characterization. Additionally, effects of the heat treatment on the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. Within this study the CrNiMo has been processed successfully with a density of well above .% leading to promising mechanical properties.

PN may be seen as part of a general trend towards personalised health care and currently various types of business models are already offering such services in the market. This paper explores ethical issues of PN by examining how PN services within the contextual environment of four future scenarios about health and nutrition in Europe might affect aspects of social justice according to Martha Nussbaum’s capability approach. The scenarios have been created by a mixed group of stakeholders and experts in three consecutive workshops. This resulted in the definition of four future scenarios within a scenario space consisting of two variables: the ‘logic of health care systems’ and ‘conception of health’. Within each scenario, PN is likely to play a more or less important role in improving health by influencing food consumption patterns in society. Nussbaum’s capability approach implies a concept of social justice as a function of a minimum standard of human dignity. This denotes an account for equality in terms of a minimum of entitlements. However, also the ability of achieving individual objectives is essential for social justice. Personalisation advice in health and food consumption patterns, as aimed for by PN, is therefore acceptable provided a minimum of entitlements is guaranteed to all members of a society, and at the same time freedom concerning personal preferences is respected. Potential variation of how different people might benefit from PN should therefore be consistent with the minimum required as defined by the list of capabilities.","doc_id":15699,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10891","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Auswirkungen und Risiken der Produktion mineralischer Dünger : eine kartographische Auseinandersetzung","authors":"Mariani, Ennio","subject":"NPK-Dünger; NPK-Düngemittel; Kartographische Darstellung; Ressourcen-Karte; PhosphorReserven; Kalium-Reserven; Haber-Bosch-Verfahren; Phosphorgips; Pottasche Umweltbelastungen;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"363, 630","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Auswirkungen und Risiken der Produktion mineralischer Dünger : eine kartographische Auseinandersetzung; NPK-Dünger; NPK-Düngemittel; Kartographische Darstellung; Ressourcen-Karte; PhosphorReserven; Kalium-Reserven; Haber-Bosch-Verfahren; Phosphorgips; Pottasche Umweltbelastungen;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Landwirtschaft; Based on a literature research this bachelor thesis examines the risks and effects of the production of NPK fertilizers and visualizes the results in the form of maps. The future availability of reserves is among the most important risks in the production of P and K fertilizers. The main risk in the production of N fertilizers lies in the high energy consumption generated in the process. While there are no direct environmental impacts documented for N, there are several documented cases of local environmental damage for P and K. The results of this study indicate that the situation of the global K reserves should be classified as more critical than previously assumed. Since the P reserves were massively revised upward in , the outlook for this resource is more positive than in the past. In the near future the largest reserves of both elements will be spread among fewer countries, thus making all the others dependent on them even more. For the production of N fertilizers the high energy consumption is currently the only limiting factor. However, an increased scarcity of fossil fuels, expected in the near future, might lead to problems. The present thesis also demonstrates that predicting the life of a resource is always subject to considerable uncertainty.; Die vorliegende Bachelorarbeit untersucht anhand einer Literaturrecherche die Risiken und Auswirkungen der Produktion von NPK-Düngern und visualisiert sie in Form von Karten. Zu den wichtigsten Risiken gehört bei der Produktion von Phosphor- und Kaliumdüngemitteln die Verfügbarkeit der Reserven, bei Stickstoffdüngern der hohe Energieverbrauch bei der Herstellung. Während bei N keine direkten Umweltauswirkungen dokumentiert sind, liegen für P und K diverse belegte Fälle von lokalen Umweltschäden vor.Die Ergebnisse der Studie zeigen auf, dass die Situation der globalen K-Reserven kritischer eingestuft werden muss als bisher angenommen. Da die P-Reserven im Jahr  massiv nach oben korrigiert wurden, stimmen die Prognosen für diese Ressource zuversichtlicher als auch schon. Die grössten Reserven beider Elemente werden in nächster Zukunft aber auf immer weniger Länder verteilt sein, was grosse Abhängigkeiten von diesen mit sich bringt. Für die Herstellung von Stickstoffdüngern ist der hohe Energieverbrauch momentan der einzige limitierende Faktor. Dies ist insofern problematisch, als dass in nächster Zeit mit der Verknappung fossiler Energieträger gerechnet werden muss. Grundsätzlich beweist die vorliegende Arbeit aber auch, dass Voraussagen bezüglich der Lebensdauer einer Ressource immer mit grossen Unsicherheiten verbunden sind.","doc_id":15735,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"39","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13658","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Tool qualification considerations for tools supporting STPA","authors":"Krauss, Sven Stefan; Rejzek, Martin; Hilbes, Christian","subject":"STPA; STAMP; SAHRA; Safety;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"005","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Tool qualification considerations for tools supporting STPA; STPA; STAMP; SAHRA; Safety;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; Talk; We evaluated tool qualification requirements for hazard and risk analysis software tools, particularly for tools supporting System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and compared the tool qualification approaches of safety standards IEC , EN , DO-C/DO- and ISO .

It is assumed that VR is compatible with the learning theory of constructivism through the possibility of immersion, interaction, D representation and the possibility of adopting several perspectives.To investigate the topic, a vision has been developed for a learning unit within the competence area Nature and Technology on the subject \"Plastics and its effects on the environment\". Divided into five learning blocks, the learning unit provides the students with knowledge about the structure, production, recycling and environmental consequences with possible approaches to solutions. Ideas for possible VR applications were developed for each of these blocks. The vision was discussed in four interviews with teachers. The VR applications were commented and evaluated by  students of the same class. The topic \"Environmental Problem Microplastics\" selected for implementation is topical, fits into curriculum and is compatible with the specialist areas suitable for VR.In summary, it can be said that VR is still a long way from a nationwide deployment at the Swiss elementary school.

Ein wichtiger Ansatzpunkt ist die effizientere Nutzung der bestehenden Ressourcen, sei es materiell oder finanziell. So bestehen auch in der Schweizer Obstproduktion und -konsumation verschiedene Ineffizienzen. Bei Privatpersonen, die im Besitz von eigenen Obstbäumen sind, übersteigt die Erntemenge den eigenen Konsumbedarf oftmals, überschüssiges Obst wird kompostiert statt konsumiert. Obstbauern, die das produzierte Obst über den indirekten Vertriebsweg verkaufen, erhalten tiefere Produzentenpreise als beim Verkauf von Obst über den direkten Vertriebsweg. Dies ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass beim indirekten Vertriebsweg mehrere Intermediäre in den Absatzweg involviert sind. Aufgrund der beschränkten Reichweite bestehender direkter Vertriebswege können jedoch viele Obstbauern das höhere Ertragspotenzial beim direkten Vertrieb nicht genügend ausschöpfen.Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Bachelorarbeit wird deshalb die Fragestellung untersucht, inwiefern eine digitale Plattform dazu beitragen kann, die anfallenden Lebensmittelverluste bei Privatpersonen im Besitz von Obstbäumen zu reduzieren und die Obstbauern bei der Ausschöpfung des Ertragspotential des direkten Vertriebsweg zu unterstützen.Das entwickelte Geschäftsmodell der digitalen Plattform «Obst vom Baum» ermöglicht den Handel von Obst zwischen Privatpersonen und Obstbauern als Anbietende und Privatpersonen als Nachfragende.

Aquaponics (AP) combines two technologies: recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) and hydroponics (plant production in water, without soil) in a closed-loop system. One challenge to the development of this technology is the conversion of the toxic ammonium produced by the fish into nitrate, via bacteria in a biofilter, to provide nitrogen to the plants.

However, most of the currently available nutrition apps lack scientific evaluation and user acceptance.Objective: The objective of this study was the systematic design of a theory-driven and target group–adapted dietary mobile app concept to promote healthy eating habits with a focus on drinking habits as well as consumption of fruits and vegetables in adolescents and young adults, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds.Methods: The design process was guided by the behavior change wheel (BCW). The development process comprised  stages. In stage , the target behavior was specified, and facilitators and barriers were identified. Furthermore, important insights into target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition and apps were revealed. To this end,  empirical studies were conducted with the target group. In stage , results of stage  were translated into behavior change techniques (BCTs) and, finally, into app functionalities and features. Consequently, in stage , the concept was evaluated and optimized through expert interviews.Results: Facilitators and barriers for achieving the target behavior were psychological capabilities (eg, self efficacy), reflective motivation (eg, fitness), automatic motivation, social support, and physical opportunity (eg, time). Target group interests, needs, and values in the field of nutrition were translated into target group preferences for app usage, for example, low usage effort, visual feedback, or recipes. Education, training, incentives, persuasion, and enablement were identified as relevant intervention functions. Together with the target group preferences, these were translated via  BCTs, such as rewards, graded tasks, or self-monitoring into the app concept Challenge to go (Cgo). The expert evaluation suggested changes of some app features for improving adherence, positive health effects, and technical feasibility. The Cgo concept comprises  worlds: the () drinking, () vegetable, and () fruit worlds. In each world, the users are faced with challenges including feedback and a quiz. Tips were developed based on the health action process approach and to help users gain challenges and, thereby, achieve the target behavior. Challenges can be played alone or against someone in the community. Due to different activities, points can be collected, and levels can be achieved. Collected points open access to an Infothek (information section), where users can choose content that interests them. An avatar guides user through the app.Conclusions: Cgo is aimed at adolescents and young adults and aims to improve their fruit and vegetable consumption as well as drinking habits. It is a theory-driven and target group–adapted dietary mobile intervention concept that uses gamification and was systematically developed using the BCW.","doc_id":16244,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"76","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13426","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Transition towards improved regional wood flows by integrating material flux analysis and agent analysis : the case of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Switzerland","authors":"Binder, Claudia R.; Hofer, Christoph; Wiek, Arnim; Scholz, Roland W.","subject":"Agent analysis; Material flux analysis; Regional wood management; Transition process;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"634","year":"2004","for_data_analysis":"Transition towards improved regional wood flows by integrating material flux analysis and agent analysis : the case of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Switzerland; Agent analysis; Material flux analysis; Regional wood management; Transition process;  Obstanlagen, Früchte und Forstwirtschaft; This paper discusses the integration of material flux analysis and agent analysis as the basis for a transition towards improved regional wood management in Appenzell Ausserrhoden (AR), a small Swiss canton located in the Pre-Alps of Switzerland. We present a wood flow analysis for forests, wood processing industries and consumption in AR, accounting for different wood products. We find that the forest is currently significantly underutilized although there are sizeable imports of wood and fuel to this small region. The underutilization of the forest contributes to a skewed age distribution, jeopardizing long-term sustainable development of the forest, as the fulfillment of its protective and production function are likely to be at risk. The wood resources, however, are capable of satisfying current wood demand among the population of AR and wood could even be exported. Underutilization has two main causes: first, wood prices are so low that harvesting trees is a money-losing proposition; second, consumer wood demand and the current supply from forest owners are not aligned. Furthermore, cultural values, lifestyle trends and traditions make an alignment of supply and demand difficult. Consensus and strategy building with the relevant stakeholders on the basis of the results obtained from the wood flow analysis and agent analysis is a reasonable next step to take. We conclude that wood flow analysis combined with agent analysis provide a useful and straightforward tool to be used as the basis of a transition process towards improved regional wood flows, which in turn should contribute to sustainable forest management.","doc_id":16262,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6354","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Blick in die Zukunft - soziale Nachhaltigkeit im Workplace Management : Befunde und Forderungen","authors":"Windlinger Inversini, Lukas","subject":"Workplace management; Nachhaltigkeit;  Arbeitsökonomie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"331","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Blick in die Zukunft - soziale Nachhaltigkeit im Workplace Management : Befunde und Forderungen; Workplace management; Nachhaltigkeit;  Arbeitsökonomie; Welche Faktoren sind zu beachten, wenn man Bürogebäude und -räume planen, bauen und betreiben will, die über den Lebenszyklus betrachtet nicht nur ökonomisch und ökologisch nachhaltig sind sondern auch den Nutzenden ganzjährig ein komfortables, gesundes und arbeitsunterstützendes Arbeitsumfeld bieten?Unsere Forschung zeigt, dass nicht Gebäudeeigenschaften, Bürotypen oder die Einhaltung von Normen und Empfehlungen zur Innenraumqualität Komfort, Gesundheit, Arbeitsleistung und Arbeitszufriedenheit von Büronutzenden vorherzusagen vermögen.

Was geschichtlich schon mit limitierten Möglichkeiten zu grossen Problemen führte, profitiert in jüngster Zeit von der Veränderung des Medien-Ökosystems, wobei primär die rasante Verbreitung von Online-Nachrichten, insbesondere über soziale Netzwerke, als problematisch identifiziert wird. Zusätzlich verändern Technologien wie Deepfakes, welche immer glaubwürdiger und zugänglicher werden, die Dynamik von Fake News. Diese Arbeit behandelt, wie Fake News und Deepfakes die Medienumwelt beeinflussen. Dies wird anhand der Schweizer Medienlandschaft im Allgemeinen sowie konkreter bei den Stakeholdern Konsumierende, Medienschaffende und traditionelle Medienunternehmen betrachtet. Die theoretische Grundlage dieser Arbeit wird anhand einer Literaturanalyse aufgezeigt, wobei eine Verbindung zur Schweizer Medienlandschaft hergestellt wird. Basierend auf diesen Erkenntnissen und unter zusätzlicher Betrachtung von recherchierten Beispielen, wird induktiv ein Wirkungsketten-Modell erarbeitet. In diesem Modell werden die Phasen und Stakeholder identifiziert und analysiert. Ergänzt werden diese Untersuchungen durch eine quantitative Umfrage zum Konsumverhalten bei Studierenden in der Schweiz und durch qualitative Experteninterviews mit ausgewählten Medienschaffenden. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit zeigen auf, dass auch die Schweiz anfällig für Fake News ist, aber über Eigenschaften verfügt, um die Problematik mitigieren zu können. Die empirische Forschung stellt eine Sensibilität der Stakeholder für diese Thematik fest. Dabei gehört das Überprüfen von Informationen bei der befragten Zielgruppe und eine erhöhte Achtsamkeit von Medienschaffenden im Umgang mit Informationen zur neuen Selbstverständlichkeit. Schweizer Medienunternehmen arbeiten schon länger mit strikten Verifikationsprozessen und Qualitätssicherungen, die durch die jüngsten Entwicklungen nicht wesentlich angepasst werden mussten. Trotzdem führen einige Unternehmen zur Unterstützung im Kampf gegen Fake News weitere Instanzen ein, vor allem für technische Aspekte. Bezüglich Deepfakes ist die erwartete Menge bisher ausgeblieben. Dies führt dazu, dass die Medienunternehmen durch eine differenzierte Einschätzung der Situation, unterschiedliche Vorgehen wählen.Abschliessend ist zu empfehlen, dass die Konsumierenden eine kritische Haltung bezüglich Informationsinhalt und -medium einnehmen und sich aktiv in differenzierte Diskussionen einbringen. Dies senkt die Anfälligkeit für Fake News. Die Gefahr der Weiterverbreitung von Falschinformationen durch Medienunternehmen, auch in der Absicht, diese zu korrigieren, kann problematisch sein, weshalb dies kritisch beurteilt werden soll. Zusätzlich sollen die Mitarbeitenden auf neue Technologien sensibilisiert und die aktuellen Entwicklungen genau verfolgt werden. Zudem wird dem Staat empfohlen, durch gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen die Qualität der Berichterstattung in der Schweiz zu unterstützen und zu sichern.","doc_id":16424,"prior":"Konsumverhalten","sdg12":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5683","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Die Energienachfrage steuern : Handlungsempfehlungen zur Nutzung von Smart-Meter-Daten","authors":"Carabias-Hütter, Vicente; Eschenauer, Ursula; Kuehn, Tobias; Lobsiger-Kägi, Evelyn; Mildenberger, Thoralf","subject":"Energy transition; Energy consumption; Demand side management; Behavioural change;  Gemeinschaften;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"307, 333","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Die Energienachfrage steuern : Handlungsempfehlungen zur Nutzung von Smart-Meter-Daten; Energy transition; Energy consumption; Demand side management; Behavioural change;  Gemeinschaften;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Mit digitalen Stromzählern – smart meter – können Stromkund(inn)en zu energieeffizientem Verhalten motiviert werden.

Visionary and provocative schemes such as Vertical farms (Despommier ) and utopian renders by architects like Callebaut (DD  New Worlds, ) are widely disseminated and evidence public interest, but do not provide practical tools to address the situation with the technologies that are available now.While recent accentuations seem to focus on social aspects, the scientific base for these endeavours should be strengthened as well. If food is to be grown in the city, it should be of high quality, not loaded with pollutants of both urban and agricultural origins. Innovations are required that simplify successful operations in urban gardening and enable cost-effective urban farming, while making these products safe for human consumption: new planting techniques, new varieties of produce, biological pest control, irrigation techniques, and integration with existing building infrastructures. Aquaponics has the potential to contribute to all these aspects.","doc_id":16553,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24237","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Connoisseurship consumption & market evolution : the case of the Swiss mechanical watch industry and the emergence of new luxury watch brands","authors":"Pieth, Matthias; Duma, Fabio","subject":"Connoisseurship; Luxury consumer behavior; Luxury market evolution; Luxury marketing; Luxury management;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"658.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Connoisseurship consumption & market evolution : the case of the Swiss mechanical watch industry and the emergence of new luxury watch brands; Connoisseurship; Luxury consumer behavior; Luxury market evolution; Luxury marketing; Luxury management;  Marketingmanagement; The Swiss luxury watch industry is dominated by major brands which, coming out of the quartz crisis in the s, redefined themselves focusing on heritage, tradition and the craftmanship of watchmaking and today are subsidiaries of major luxury groups with the exception of brands such as Rolex, Audemars Piguet or Chopard. However, since the early ’s, several small independent watch brands have emerged in the shadow of the big players and created a lively and diverse niche market. Drawing from institutional theory and literature on connoisseurship consumption and market evolution, the present study set out to define connoisseurship in the watch context, and what effect connoisseurship consumption has on market evolution of the Swiss mechanical watch industry in general and in particular on the emergence of independent brands and their legitimization in the market. To determine and define the characteristics of connoisseurs and the role of connoisseurship consumption in the particular context, and to investigate their role in the emergence of independent watch brands, a qualitative study was conducted by conducting expert interviews with representatives of independent watch companies and watch connoisseurs. The study fills a gap in marketing research on connoisseurship consumption in the Swiss watch industry and contributes to the broader understanding of the role of connoisseurs and connoisseurship consumption for market evolution in comparable segments or product categories. The results show that connoisseurship consumption plays a considerable role in the emergence phase of independent watch brands. The findings suggest that connoisseurship consumption is important for new independent watch brands to gain customers and to build brand legitimacy. Whilst an increasing number of connoisseurs question the value propositions of some bigger and well-known brands (e.g. heritage), it remains yet to be seen if connoisseurship consumption will have an effect on the watch market in general as more consumers accumulate detailed knowledge about the sector and the product category. What can be further concluded from the study is that other factors have contributed to the emergence of independent watch brands which merit to be researched in more detail.","doc_id":16564,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3311","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Umwelt, Gesundheit und Tiere in den Lehrmitteln für Köchinnen und Köche und Restaurationsfachleute","authors":"Jenny, Maurus; Trachsel, Sonja; Baur, Priska","subject":"Ernährung; Bildungsplan; Umwelt; Gesundheit; Tiere; Koch; Restaurationsfachleute; Berufsbildung; Schweiz; Vegetarisch; Vegan; Nahrungsmittel; Gastronomie; Fleisch; Flexitarische Ernährung; Lebensmittel; Lehrmittel;  Bildung und Erziehung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"370, 640","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Umwelt, Gesundheit und Tiere in den Lehrmitteln für Köchinnen und Köche und Restaurationsfachleute; Ernährung; Bildungsplan; Umwelt; Gesundheit; Tiere; Koch; Restaurationsfachleute; Berufsbildung; Schweiz; Vegetarisch; Vegan; Nahrungsmittel; Gastronomie; Fleisch; Flexitarische Ernährung; Lebensmittel; Lehrmittel;  Bildung und Erziehung;  Hauswirtschaft und Familienleben; Eating out is becoming increasingly popular. Therefore, gastronomy has more and more of an influence on nutrition. From an ecological and health perspective and due to the fact that it is in the interest of animals, moderate consumption of animal products would be preferable. The present working paper analyses the curricula and teaching materials of chefs and gastronomy professionals in Switzerland. The focus lies on the communicated significance of animal foodstuffs. The extent to which the impacts of nutrition on the environment, health and animals are addressed in education will be examined. The results show that curricula and teaching materials do not address the ecological impact of animal production. The health effects of the consumption of animal foodstuffs are discussed in more detail. Animal husbandry is not described.  percent of recipes contain animal products/foodstuffs. The fact that that the average meat consumption in Switzerland is several times higher than that recommended for a balanced diet is not mentioned. The issue of the ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet is broached and evaluated positively from a health perspective. Exclusively plant-based nutrition is advised against. The term flexitarianism as a new trend towards moderate meat consumption does not appear in the teaching materials. Also not taken into consideration is the fact that the target audience for plant-based meals consists increasingly not only of vegetarians or vegans.","doc_id":16716,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"44","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11781","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Beyond teaching : towards co-emergent praxis in translator education","authors":"Massey, Gary; Kiraly, Don; Hofmann, Sascha","subject":"Translator education; Translation pedagogy; Emergence; Co-emergence; Translation competence development; Translator competence; Action research; Experiential learning; Organisational learning; Organisational development; Collaborative learning; Translation simulation;  Translationswissenschaft","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"418.02","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Beyond teaching : towards co-emergent praxis in translator education; Translator education; Translation pedagogy; Emergence; Co-emergence; Translation competence development; Translator competence; Action research; Experiential learning; Organisational learning; Organisational development; Collaborative learning; Translation simulation;  Translationswissenschaft; This chapter is the product of parallel as well as joint efforts by the three authors to further develop collaborative approaches to learning and teaching with the aim of contributing to sustainable innovation in translator education. In the first part of the chapter, Don Kiraly introduces an abductive frame of reasoning and an interpretivist line of inquiry for investigating processes in translator education. He then presents some of the abductive milestones along his own research trajectory, focusing particularly on findings from three action research case studies that have fed into a post-positivist model of translator expertise emergence that all three authors of this chapter are now attemping to apply and enhance. In the second part of the chapter, Gary Massey takes an organisational perspective to pre-sent and discuss the applicability of the co-emergence concept to the continuing development of translator education programmes and institutions. He refers to measures that have been un-dertaken at IUED to foster curriculum development and organisational learning within the context of the model Kiraly proposes. In the third part, Sascha Hofmann outlines the genesis of a ‘translation agency simulator’, which he is currently developing at FTSK as an instructional tool for simulated translation project work.

Frequent applications are process screening and optimization. Thereby, the focus lies mostly on a homogeneous and fast distribution of substrates and gases whilst power consumption and shearing force are meant to be kept low, which ideally results in high biomass concentrations and product titers.For characterization purposes, the mixing time and the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) were measured in  L and  mL Thomson Optimal Growth™ shaking flasks, using the de-colorization or the dynamic gassing-out method, respectively. Those geometrical optimized bioreactors are promising higher space-time yields compared to the predominant Erlenmeyer-shake flask design. According to the results of the procedural experiments, CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were cultivated at selected, auspicious parameter combinations. The effectiveness of the predetermined parameters was evaluated and a scale-up method elaborated. The results can be summarized as follows:The key parameter for all experimental setups is the shaking rate. In contrast, the filling volume showed to have a more ambiguous role. Modeling results in the  mL flasks showed no significant influence of the filling volume to the maximal cell density, in contrast to the L flask (both shaken at  mm throw). The highest viable cell density (up to .∙⁶ cells mL⁻¹) was reached using the  mL flask with high shaking rates at  mm shaking diameter. Thereby, a µmax of . h- was achieved that correlates with a td of less than  h. All in all, the highest µmax of . h⁻¹ was reached during the scale-up process, whereby higher viable cell densities were reached compared to the batch cultivations using the same parameter settings.

In recent years many programmes have been launched focusing on corporate energy saving potential in Switzerland. However, only one percent of , Swiss small and medium enterprises (SMEs) – representing a potential energy saving of approximately % of total Swiss power consumption – participate in energy efficiency programmes, and among them the actual implementation rates are poor.This paper is part of a research project that aims to give recommendations on how to increase participation in energy efficiency programmes and to improve the implementation rate of energy efficiency measures in SMEs. The paper focuses on identifying different market segments in order to design specific programme approaches. It adopts the Stages of Change model (Prochaska & Di Clemente, ) to identify potential market segments as a function of their current energy efficiency behaviour and to analyse and profile each of these market segments based on company-specific factors, attitudes, perceptions and motivation.A survey of  SME representatives in Switzerland was carried out. Three different segments were identified: SMEs that do not participate in energy efficiency programmes, SMEs that plan to do so, and SMEs that have already joined a programme. In terms of participation in energy efficiency programmes, the study revealed that the three segments are linked to different needs, expectations and general conditions, and that they arise as a result of different factors. It suggests that in order to foster the implementation of energy efficiency programs, SMEs on different stages of change need to be approached in different ways, and that programme characteristics need to take into account company size and ownership of business premises, provide clear and transparent communication of the implementation effort involved, showcase “best practice” examples, and develop a more comprehensive and/or amended definition of cost savings and benefits.","doc_id":17076,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1978","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) batteries through non-intrusive load monitoring","authors":"Baumann, Patrick Walter; Heinzelmann, Andreas; Benyoucef, Dirk; Held, Pirmin","subject":"Inverter; Power optimiser; Micro-inverter (AC modules); Monitoring system; Battery; Charge regulator; Measurement; Testing;  Systeme;  Energietechnik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"003, 621.04, 621.3","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) batteries through non-intrusive load monitoring; Inverter; Power optimiser; Micro-inverter (AC modules); Monitoring system; Battery; Charge regulator; Measurement; Testing;  Systeme;  Energietechnik;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; Corporate project team consisting of Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) and Furtwangen University (HFU) analysed and examined the energy usage and its flow in a common household with a Photovoltaic (PV) plant and a battery as storage of the generated PV power. The aim was to optimise the power usage in a configuration with the battery. The energy generated by the PV plant and stored in the battery is quite valuable in terms of efficiency and environmental friendliness. The problem which rises here, however, is the best usage of the power. The common approach is that based on certain parameters the inverter decides when to draw power from the battery. Important parameters for this decision are the actual load current based on electrical devices used in the household and the state of charge (SOC) of the battery. The main problem is disproportional power loss in the inverter by low-load currents drawn from the battery. Measurements of the battery made by the ZHAW demonstrated this problem. The idea is to use the battery power only for high-power devices with knowledge of the usage routine of the devices. So, the determining factor is not the load current but the recognition and usage-prediction of specific devices, such as a stove or water kettle. Only such high-power devices should be powered by the battery so that the losses in the inverter are driven to be negligible.; To identify single devices, the load current must be measured. For the sake of simplicity and economy, only one measurement is installed. With digital signal processing and an adapted algorithm, it has been shown that devices can be identified in many cases. The consumption of individual devices is determined by a non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) system from the total consumption (more details to follow below). An innovation resulted from combining typical energy-system challenges (e.g. minimising losses) which are common for individual PV plants at private homes. With a simple device the efficiency of existing batteries can be improved significant.","doc_id":17097,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"81","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21746","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Can we design software as we talk? : a research idea","authors":"Ruiz, Marcela; Hasselmann, Björn","subject":" Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Spezielle Computerverfahren","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"005, 006","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Can we design software as we talk? : a research idea;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Spezielle Computerverfahren; In the context of digital transformation, speeding up the time-to-market of high-quality software products is a big challenge. Main challenges. Software quality correlates with the success of requirements engineering (RE) sessions. RE sessions demand software analysts to collect all relevant material usually specified on written notes, flip charts, pictures, etc. Afterwards comprehensible requirements need to be specified for software implementation and testing. These activities are mostly performed manually, which causes process delays and software quality attributes like reliability, usability, comprehensibility, etc., are diminished causing software devaluation. Innovative aspects. This research idea paper proposes a framework for automating the tasks of requirements specification. The proposed framework involves computational mechanisms to enable the automatic generation of software design while requirements are discussed. The innovative aspect of this research comes from digitally transforming the software development life cycle (SDLC) where requirements are generated “on the fly” and virtual reality systems are in place. Potential to make change. The proposed framework has the potential to renovate the role of software analysts, which can experience substantial reduction of manual tasks, more efficient communication, dedication to more analytical tasks, and assurance of software quality from conception phases. This research idea paper introduces the framework for automating the task of requirements specification, and report our progress.

Recently several publications mentioned insufficient recovery rates and even retention time shifts attributed to unspecific membrane–particle interactions. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is based on the surface charge (zeta-potential) of the membrane material and the particle. In this study, we investigated in how far the ζ-potential of AF membrane and particles would determine the outcome of AF in terms of feasibility, separation efficiency, retention time, and recovery rate, or whether other factors such as membrane morphology and particle size were equally important. We systematically studied the influence of the ζ-potential on the interactions between the most commonly used AF membrane materials and two representative types of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO NP). Furthermore the effect of different carrier media and additional surfactants on the surface charge of membranes and particles was investigated and the influence of the particle size and the particle concentration on the recovery rate was evaluated. We found that the eligibility of an AF method can be predicted based on the ζ-potential of the NPs and the AF membrane. Furthermore knowing the ζ-potential allows to tuning the separation efficiency of an AF method. On the other hand we observed significant shifts in retention time for different membrane materials that impede the determination of particle size based on the classical AF theory. These shifts cannot be attributed to the ζ-potential. Also the ζ-potential does not account for varying recovery rates of different particle types, instead the particle size seems to be the limiting factor. Therefore, the proper characterization of a polydisperse sample remains a challenge.","doc_id":17115,"prior":"recovery rate","sdg12":1},{"id":"33","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19207","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Die Moral der Tomate : moralische Bedenken beim Kauf von Tomatenprodukten als Grundlage zur Erstellung einer Einkaufsentscheidungshilfe","authors":"Baumann, Anna","subject":"Moral concerns; Moralische Bedenken; Umwelteinstellungen; Labels; Konsum; Tomaten; Anbauverfahren;  Psychologie;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"150, 338.927","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Die Moral der Tomate : moralische Bedenken beim Kauf von Tomatenprodukten als Grundlage zur Erstellung einer Einkaufsentscheidungshilfe; Moral concerns; Moralische Bedenken; Umwelteinstellungen; Labels; Konsum; Tomaten; Anbauverfahren;  Psychologie;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Der Konsum der industrialisierten Länder zeigt seit Jahren einen steigenden Trend und geht mit diversen negativ zu betrachtenden Auswirkungen einher, wie beispielsweise steigenden Emissionen, Ressourcenverknappung, Überkonsum und einer Reduktion der Biodiversität und Artenvielfalt (Brunner, ).

The fundamental aspects of these topics are discussed, and state-of-the-art developments are presented. The book covers subject areas like bio-sensors co-integration with nanotechnology, and for these CMOS circuits one popular application could be personalized medicine. Having seen the power assets for such technologies, and knowing what challenges these present for the circuits and systems designer, remote powering and sensors solutions are reviewed in the second chapter. The third chapter contains an industrial contribution on remote powering, presenting energy harvesting from the RF field to power a target wireless sensor network consumption. Having touched the idea of the low current consumption, µA or Nano-Amp range and their transient behaviours are also described. Digital and large-scale integrated circuits - seen from an academic point of view - is included in chapter five, and this same topic from an industrial point of view is given in the chapter thereafter. An additional topic on the hall sensor, applied in an automotive case study, is then also presented. Approaching the duty-cycling of active mode, oscillator for timers and system-level power management including the cloud are covered in the last chapters. Power Management for Internet of Everything targets post-graduate students and those persons active in industry, whom understand and can connect system design with system on chip (SoC) and mixed-signal design as broader set of circuits and systems. The topic of Internet of Things (IoT), ranging from data converters for sensor interfaces to radios and software application, is also addressed from the viewpoint of power and energy management.

The environmental impacts analysed were greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative energy demand, ozone depletion, human toxicity, particulate matter and ecotoxicity. The technical alternatives included expansion of the electricity grid, restrictive allocation of electricity supply limits, as well as the use of lithium-ion battery systems for electricity storage and demand side management (DSM). We applied a prospective life cycle assessment in order to compare the life cycle environmental impacts of the different technical alternatives of integrating photovoltaic power plants with a total peak power of  MWp into a  km long, low voltage electricity grid supplying  consumers in Switzerland.

Automatically collected digital receipts from loyalty cards hereby promise to serve as an objective and automatically traceable digital marker for individual food choice behavior and do not require users to manually log individual meal items. With the introduction of the General Data Privacy Regulation in the European Union, millions of consumers gained the right to access their shopping data in a machine-readable form, representing a historic chance to leverage shopping data for scalable monitoring of food choices. Multiple quantitative indicators for evaluating the nutritional quality of food shopping have been suggested, but so far, no comparison has validated the potential of these alternative indicators within a comparative setting. This manuscript thus represents the first study to compare the calibration capacity and to validate the discrimination potential of previously suggested food shopping quality indicators for the nutritional quality of shopped groceries, including the Food Standards Agency Nutrient Profiling System Dietary Index (FSA-NPS DI), Grocery Purchase Quality Index- (GPQI), Healthy Eating Index- (HEI-), Healthy Trolley Index (HETI) and Healthy Purchase Index (HPI), checking if any of them performs differently from the others. The hypothesis is that some food shopping quality indicators outperform the others in calibrating and discriminating individual actual dietary intake. To assess the indicators’ potentials,  eligible participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and donated their digital receipts from the loyalty card programs of the two leading Swiss grocery retailers, which represent % of the national grocery market. Compared to absolute food and nutrient intake, correlations between density based relative food and nutrient intake and food shopping data are stronger. The FSA-NPS DI has the best calibration and discrimination performance in classifying participants’ consumption of nutrients and food groups, and seems to be a superior indicator to estimate nutritional quality of a user’s diet based on digital receipts from grocery shopping in Switzerland.","doc_id":17243,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3500","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Toward a fully cloudified mobile network infrastructure","authors":"Sousa, Bruno; Cordeiro, Luis; Simões, Paulo; Edmonds, Andrew; Ruiz, Santiago; Carella, Giuseppe A.; Corici, Marius; Nikaein, Navid; Gomes, Andre S.; Schiller, Eryk; Braun, Torsten; Bohnert, Thomas Michael","subject":"InIT; SE; Cloud; Nfv;  Informatik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"004","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Toward a fully cloudified mobile network infrastructure; InIT; SE; Cloud; Nfv;  Informatik; Cloud computing enables the on-demand delivery of resources for a multitude of services and gives the opportunity for small agile companies to compete with large industries. In the telco world, cloud computing is currently mostly used by mobile network operators (MNO) for hosting non-critical support services and selling cloud services such as applications and data storage. MNOs are investigating the use of cloud computing to deliver key telecommunication services in the access and core networks. Without this, MNOs lose the opportunities of both combining this with over-the-top (OTT) and value-added services to their fundamental service offerings and leveraging cost-effective commodity hardware. Being able to leverage cloud computing technology effectively for the telco world is the focus of mobile cloud networking (MCN). This paper presents the key results of MCN integrated project that includes its architecture advancements, prototype implementation, and evaluation. Results show the efficiency and the simplicity that a MNO can deploy and manage the complete service lifecycle of fully cloudified, composed services that combine OTT/IT- and mobile-network-based services running on commodity hardware. The extensive performance evaluation of MCN using two key proof-of-concept scenarios that compose together many services to deliver novel converged elastic, on-demand mobile-based but innovative OTT services proves the feasibility of such fully virtualized deployments.

Cooperative content caching similarly serves efficiency goals for data-intensive applications in edge networks. In this work, we propose two cooperative cache replacement algorithms in DD networks to support these techniques: i) distance-based ii) priority-class based. Video content dissemination in an edge network is our main use-case. In such content traffic, video characteristics have a significant impact on the system behavior.

By means of highly customized and integrated, product-service offerings, these firms address complex business problems of customers in a holistic way. However, the extent to which manufacturers derive financial returns from investments made into this advanced form of service provision remains debatable. Prior research shows that the further the manufacturer moves from the established basis in selling equipment and related, product-oriented services, the more difficult it is to generate profits (Fang et al., ; Neely, ). While failure stories in the scientific literature are scarce, practitioners report figures on unsuccessful transformation projects: Krishnamurthy () estimate that  % of the companies that want to offer solutions fail to return the associated costs. According to Roegner and Gobbi (), only about % of all solution sellers finally recapture their capital costs, and even fewer achieve the  to % increase in profitability that McKinsey expects from successfully implementing business solutions. At the same time, despite the reported challenges, any large-scale transition away from solution business cannot be witnessed. This leads to the assumption that managers persist with solution business at least partly for strategic reasons. However, beyond broadly based arguments stressing managerial beliefs of the differentiating role of customer solutions, it is unknown what the specific and measurable market effects are that help to explain why engaging in solution business is strategically important for the manufacturer. To contribute to this gap in extant understanding, the purpose of this study is to examine solution business as a market signal (Spence, , ). We assume that irrespective of the direct revenues generated by solution business, manufacturers benefit strategically from the positive spillover effects of solution business on the firm’s underlying product business through a signaling mechanism: Credibly signaling the capabilities associated with solution selling, such as understanding of the customer’s business, designing and implementing solutions that generate superior value-in-use, and commitment to supporting the customer during the full life cycle of the provided solution (Tuli et al., ; Ulaga & Reinartz, ; Macdonald et al., ) lower the customer’s risk perception.","doc_id":17544,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"62","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20075","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Co-cultivation of microalgae in aquaculture water : interactions, growth and nutrient removal efficiency at laboratory- and pilot-scale","authors":"Tejido-Nuñez, Yaiza; Aymerich, Enrique; Sancho, Luis; Refardt, Dominik","subject":"Aquaculture; Nutrients; Protozoa; Water treatment; Chlorella vulgaris; Tetradesmus obliquus;  Biologie;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570, 630","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Co-cultivation of microalgae in aquaculture water : interactions, growth and nutrient removal efficiency at laboratory- and pilot-scale; Aquaculture; Nutrients; Protozoa; Water treatment; Chlorella vulgaris; Tetradesmus obliquus;  Biologie;  Landwirtschaft; - Successful co-cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris and Tetradesmus obliquus- Stable cultivation despite presence of protozoa- Shifts in species frequency in co-culture likely caused by protozoa- Pilot-scale cultivation reached a final dry weight of . g l−- Maximum productivity at pilot-scale was . g m− d−; Microalgae biotechnology is of increasing importance and a central application concerns the treatment of wastewater.

Producing MIEDs requires resources, energy and causes considerable emissions. Extending the service life MIEDs could significantly reduce the demand for new devices and associated environmental impacts. However, whether service life extension actually reduces environmental impacts associated with MIEDs is still uncertain. First, available life cycle assessments of MIEDs suggest that the production of integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for the majority of GHG emissions during the production phase and that greenhouse gas emissions increase with the size of the device and, more importantly, with its storage capacity. However, there is only little information available on MIED specific components such as logic or memory type integrated circuits. In order to quantify environmental impacts of service life extension of MIEDs new approaches for life cycle inventory modelling (e.g. modular modelling) are required. Second, service life-extending measures are subject to rebound effects, which occur if the number of devices being produced does not fall as expected. Such effects depend on consumer behaviour (e.g. re-spending effects) and the rationalities of involved economic actors. Thus, environmental, behavioural and economic aspects have tobe taken into account in order to develop service life extending measures that entail environmental benefits while being both economically viable and appealing to consumers.","doc_id":17690,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12146","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"GEYSER : enabling green data centres in smart cities","authors":"Anghel, Ionut; Bertoncini, Massimo; Cioara, Tudor; Cupelli, Marco; Georgiadou, Vasiliki; Jahangiri, Pooyan; Monti, Antonello; Murphy, Seán; Schoofs, Anthony; Velivassaki, Terpsi","subject":"Energy efficient data centres;  Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"GEYSER : enabling green data centres in smart cities; Energy efficient data centres;  Informatik; Information Technology is a dominant player of our modern societies; Data Centres, lying at the heart of the IT landscape, have attracted attention, with their increasing energy consumption being a constant topic of concern, especially when it comes to the negative impact on the quality of their surrounding environment.

To reach this goal, the term “sustainability of cryptocurrencies” was first defined through the means of a detailed analysis on various attributes that define cryptocurrencies as well as their reward systems. In order to research existing consensus mechanisms and reward systems as well as their current capabilities, shortcomings and dissemination, a literature review was conducted. This lays the foundation for the subsequent comparative analysis on the introduced consensus algorithms and deduction of a sustainable variant that fulfills the main sustainability criteria identified for this context: scalability, security, power consumption, long-term governance as well as the incentives and costs of participating in the consensus protocol. Over the course of this research, only one existing consensus algorithm category under the name of delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) has shown to best achieve the traits outlined above and the specific example of a cryptocurrency called EOS is identified and elaborated in detail. Having outlined the initial definition of a sustainable cryptocurrency, future research and development in this direction is recommended to review the subtle yet important differences within the category of dPoS cryptocurrencies to determine the most sustainable approach and potentially refine the given definition.

Als Antwort auf das Postulat Chevalley erarbeitet der Bund einen Aktionsplan für die Vermeidung von Lebensmittelabfällen. Danach sollten alle Akteure entlang der Lebensmittel-Wertschöpfungskette Massnahmen umsetzen zur Reduktion von Lebensmittelverlusten sowohl im eigenen Betrieb als auch in den vor- und nachgelagerten Stufen der Lebensmittelkette.Weil die Datierungsart von Lebensmitteln einen wichtigen Faktor für Lebensmittelverluste im Handel und beim Konsumenten darstellt, soll mit diesem Projekt der im Jahr  vom Bundesamt für Lebensmittelsicherheit und Veterinärwesen (BLV) herausgegebene Datierungsleitfaden für Hersteller von Lebensmitteln überarbeitet und hinsichtlich Food Waste Vermeidung optimiert werden. Den Kern des Berichtes bilden konkrete Empfehlungen für die korrekte Wahl der Datierungsart, also für welche Lebensmittelkategorien ein Verbrauchsdatum (VD) aus Gründen der Lebensmittelsicherheit notwendig ist und welche Lebensmittelkategorien zur Vermeidung unnötiger Lebensmittelverluste mit einem Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum (MHD) gekennzeichnet werden sollten. Dazu wurde in einem ersten Schritt eine Marktanalyse mit über  relevanten Produkten durchgeführt und die heutige Datierungsart erfasst. In einem zweiten Schritt wurde ein Entscheidungsbaum der European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) angewendet, welcher die zur Sicherstellung der Lebensmittelsicherheit geeignete Datierungsart aufgrund intrinsischer und extrinsischer Faktoren der Lebensmittel festlegt. Besonderes Augenmerk wurde dabei auf Produktegruppen mit heute uneinheitlicher Datierungsart gelegt (z.B. gesäuerte Milchprodukte). In einem dritten Schritt wurde der gesamte Warenkorb in rund  bezüglich Datierungsart möglichst homogene Produktegruppen eingeteilt und die jeweils empfohlene Datierungsart festgehalten. Für  Lebensmittelkategorien wird eine konsequente Umdatierung von VD in MHD empfohlen. Dies ist insbesondere mit dem Wegfall des Verkaufsdatums beim letzten grossen Schweizer Detailhändler heute umso wichtiger geworden, weil bei Produkten mit einem VD kein Spielraum mehr für Lebensmittelspenden besteht.Des Weiteren wird empfohlen, zum Einfrieren geeignete Produkte z.B. mit einem Schneeflockensymbol und digital verlinkten Zusatzinformationen entsprechend zu kennzeichnen, damit Händler und Konsumenten eher von dieser Möglichkeit Gebrauch machen, bevor ein Produkt das Ablaufdatum erreicht und entsorgt werden muss. Der Bericht wird abgerundet mit Empfehlungen für weitere Massnahmen zur Vermeidung von Lebensmittelverlusten.Somit liefert dieser Bericht eine Entscheidungsgrundlage für Hersteller, um durch eine dem heutigen Stand des Wissens angepasste Datierungsweise ihrer Produkte die Verschwendung von Lebensmitteln im Handel sowie bei den Konsumenten zu vermindern und ihren Beitrag zur Erreichung des Sustainable Development Goals «Food Waste Halbierung bis » zu leisten.","doc_id":18000,"prior":"Lebensmittelverluste","sdg12":1},{"id":"3","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2708","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Constraints on creativity: the case of CAT tools","authors":"Ehrensberger-Dow, Maureen; Massey, Gary","subject":"Translation-process; Cognitive-ergonomics; ErgoTrans presentation; Language-technology;  Computerlinguistik;  Translationswissenschaft","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"410.285, 418.02","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Constraints on creativity: the case of CAT tools; Translation-process; Cognitive-ergonomics; ErgoTrans presentation; Language-technology;  Computerlinguistik;  Translationswissenschaft; The increasing use of language technology tools, such as translation memory, termbanks, and online dictionaries, has prompted an interest in their impact on cognitive processes, creativity, and the quality of translation products. Originally designed to improve consistency and increase speed, tools also facilitate searches for information and the recycling of previously-translated passages. Ideally, CAT tools relieve translators of the tedium involved with text production and help produce creative, appropriate solutions by freeing up cognitive capacity to deal with challenging translation problems (cf. O’Brien ). Recent research, however, indicates that CAT tools are not being used to their full potential or are even unnecessarily constraining the users they should have been designed for (Ehrensberger-Dow & Massey a, b). Drawing on a large corpus of translation processes collected from professionals and students, we discuss the nature of translation in terms of cognitive, physical, and organizational ergonomics. The cognitive demands of comprehending complex content in one language, while producing and revising output in another, add a new dimension to the usual considerations of computer usability. In fact, the productivity pressures imposed on many professionals might be forcing them to adjust to their tools rather than adapting those tools to their own needs. On the basis of our findings, we argue that professional translators need to take increased ownership of language technology tools, and play a more prominent role in contributing to needs assessment, product development, application testing, training, and the integration of language technologies into organizational processes.","doc_id":18082,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22811","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"2000-Watt-Gesellschaft leben : Reduktion des End-Energieverbrauchs durch Verhaltensänderungen : Nutzerinterventionen im Hüttengraben-Areal","authors":"Sandmeier, Ernst; Lobsiger-Kägi, Evelyn; Marek, Reto; Tomic, Uros; Kälin, Stefan","subject":"2000 Watt Gesellschaft; Verhaltensinterventionen; Verhaltensänderung; Energie; Suffizienz; Monitoring;  Energie","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"333.79","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"-Watt-Gesellschaft leben : Reduktion des End-Energieverbrauchs durch Verhaltensänderungen : Nutzerinterventionen im Hüttengraben-Areal;  Watt Gesellschaft; Verhaltensinterventionen; Verhaltensänderung; Energie; Suffizienz; Monitoring;  Energie; Im vorliegenden Projekt wurden technische Lösungen mit Verhaltens-Interventionen verknüpft, um nachhaltig den Energieverbrauch in Gebäuden und Haushalten zu senken.

Products generated by enzymatic transformations are already being used in the food, feed, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry, and the accessible compound panoply is expected to expand even further. In particular, the combination of stereo-selective enzymes in linear cascade reactions is an elegant strategy toward enantiomeric pure compounds, as it reduces the number of isolation and purification steps and avoids accumulation of potentially unstable intermediates. Here, we present the set-up of an enzyme cascade to selectively convert citral to (-)-iso-isopulegol by combining an ene reductase and a squalene hopene cyclase. In the initial reaction step, the ene reductase YqjM from Bacillus subtilis selectively transforms citral to (S)-citronellal, which is subsequently cyclised exclusively to (-)-iso-isopulegol by a mutant of the squalene hopene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AacSHC).

For load-bearing bone implants, titanium and its alloys, such as TiAlV, are widely used due to their high strength to weight ratio and osseointegrative properties. However, bone resorption and loosening of implants is related to the significantly higher stiffness of dense TiAlV, leading to stress shielding. With the aging of population, there is an increasing need for orthopedic implants with a high success rate and a long implant life span. Besides that the treatment of non-healing segmental bone defects, where the self repairing properties of bone tissue are not sufficient, is still a challenge. In both fields of application, patient-specific titanium implants combined with functionally graded porosity designed according to locally expected loads unlock new possibilities. Many studies underline the huge potential of the new design freedom to generate open porous structures and more personalized implants with enhanced mechanical properties that also integrate well with surrounding tissues. Integration of functionally graded open porosity into implants allows for the implant to more closely mimic the mechanical properties of human bone and its internal architecture. The results of this work represent the basis for developing complex porous titanium structures with various pore sizes and shapes to tailor structural mechanical properties and biological responses. Therefore, D porous structures with various pore sizes and shapes were designed and manufactured in TiAlV using laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M). Based on these structures, the correlation of pore size and shape with cell ingrowth, morphology, metabolic activity, and early markers for bone formation (ALP activity) was investigated in static cell cultures using the osteosarcoma cell line Saos-. Mechanical properties, such as stiffness and compression strength, were investigated with compression testing. The present study concludes that cell morphology, metabolic activity, and ALP activity are widely independent of pore shape and size within the tested range of – µm pore size. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the evaluated structures were in the range of cortical and trabecular bone. This opens the possibility to design mechanical properties with gradient porosity without decisively affecting biological responses.","doc_id":18202,"prior":"life span","sdg12":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1897","date":"2017","language":"de","title":"JAMESfocus.

By contrast, its sister species, Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii is the host-specific causative agent of the devastating maize disease Stewart's wilt. This pathogen has a restricted lifecycle, overwintering in an insect vector before being introduced into susceptible maize cultivars, causing disease and returning to overwinter in its vector. The other subspecies of P. stewartii subsp. indologenes, has been isolated from different plant hosts and is predicted to proliferate in different environmental niches. Here we have, by the use of comparative genomics and a comprehensive suite of bioinformatic tools, analyzed the genomes of ten P. stewartii and nineteen P. ananatis strains. Our phylogenomic analyses have revealed that there are two distinct clades within P. ananatis while far less phylogenetic diversity was observed among the P. stewartii subspecies. Pan-genome analyses revealed a large core genome comprising of , protein coding sequences is shared among the twenty-nine compared strains. Furthermore, we showed that an extensive accessory genome made up largely by a mobilome of plasmids, integrated prophages, integrative and conjugative elements and insertion elements has resulted in extensive diversification of P. stewartii and P. ananatis. While these organisms share many pathogenicity determinants, our comparative genomic analyses show that they differ in terms of the secretion systems they encode.

Manifestations of such systems are concepts of smart manufacturing (or industry .), smart buildings, smart cities, smart regions, smart transport/mobility and energy systems, among others. The transformation towards such smart systems is intertwined with novel system characteristics and extended expectations on technical as well as non-technical levels. The operation of smart systems takes place in a socio-technological context along with a systemic change as already experienced by the operation of the Internet and other infrastructural systems. Requirements of these smart systems are expressed by resiliency and sustainability, which are considered to provide system stability in a changing environment, ensure safe operation (e.g. against malfunction of technical system components) and provide solutions to problems caused by unsustainable developments (e.g. overconsumption of resources and related emissions). To provide a basis to design and assess (smart) systems concerning their resilience and sustainability, methods for systemic analysis are needed. As a consequence of the different requirements of resilience and sustainability, such smart system analyses need to cover a broad spectrum from small-scale technical system entities right up  to large-scale environmental and societal systems, in order to assess the ability of the systems to run in the long term. This article aims to provide basic conceptual ideas on how to integrate the different approaches of risk, resilience and sustainability. It also aims to suggest an approach for smart system analysis by integrating resilience and sustainability as main principles stabilizing systems by allowing for flexible reactions to changes. The paper identifies interfaces of methods covering different aspects important for smart system analysis. For this, the discussion starts by defining the terms risk, smart systems, resilience, and sustainability as main principles of system analysis.  This differentiated definition of terms gives a first idea of the different concepts in use when analysing common and smart systems for which a description of approaches and main aspects is presented. Based on this, we identify interfaces among the basic principles of risk, resilience and sustainability and suggest an integrated approach for the analysis related to smart systems.","doc_id":18773,"prior":"overconsumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8989","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Sustainability assessment of the CO2 methanation value chain : environmental impacts and socio-economic drivers and barriers","authors":"Carabias-Hütter, Vicente; Wettstein, Sarah; Stucki, Matthias; Lopez de Obeso, Luis; Lobsiger-Kägi, Evelyn; Schneider, Gabriel; Baier, Jens; Burri, Adrian; Zipper, Christian","subject":"Methanation; Power-to-gas; Sustainability assessment;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"338.927","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Sustainability assessment of the CO methanation value chain : environmental impacts and socio-economic drivers and barriers; Methanation; Power-to-gas; Sustainability assessment;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Final scientific report; Within this project the sustainability assessment of the CO methanation value chain was performed by analyzing the following four technologies: catalytic methanation, hydrogen production with Photo-Electrochemical Cells (PEC), Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).Energy efficiency with respect to resource and climate conservation is one of the most challenging and urgent problems of our time. But as large and important as these targets are, they will not be adopted by the public as long as they are not cost-effective, lifestyle-compatible and environmentally friendly throughout the value chain. That is why we opted to evaluate new approaches for generating electricity along the CO methanation value chain with reference to all these perspectives, and to consider their results not only in public policymaking, but also for strategic decisions in companies.The goal of this research project was to assess the whole CO methanation value chain regarding social, economic and environmental sustainability by comparing various scenarios from cradle to grave.The results for the environmental sustainability depend substantially on the type of electricity used for the hydrogen production. The researchers identified a significant potential to reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, when comparing renewable and fossil methane value chains. The reason for this reduction potential is the fact that the combustion of fossil methane releases carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming whereas the direct carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of synthetic methane are equal to the carbon dioxide amount used as input in the methanation process and therefore are climate neutral. The economic investigation dealt with the calculation of the possible investment and operating costs in comparison to the currently found base scenario. In summary, it can be said that there are ways to break away from the dependency of fossil natural gas to produce self-sufficient renewable methane within Switzerland. With improvements in efficiencies, increased transit and operating times, the use of energy flows below process steps, and increased maintenance intervals, especially new technologies, there are many ways to minimize the cost difference. More accurate statements require more thorough detailed investigations. On the social dimension, it can be said that the processes involved in the subprojects are not of more concern than normal Swiss industrial activities. However, attention must be paid at the provenance of bulk materials, especially of metals (copper) and conflict minerals, cassiterite (tin), wolframite (for tungsten), coltan (for tantalum), and gold ore. For the assessed subprojects the critical materials are usually the catalysts (nickel or metals of the platinum group). It was discovered that the supply chains are usually untraceable, making it impossible to trace the exact provenance location and their respective social conditions. A strategy to fight this issue is for the Swiss companies to demand more transparency for the purchased bulk materials.The findings of this research project revealed the social, economic and environmental hotspots of the whole CO methanation value chain, which can be used by the researchers in the single subprojects and later by the implementing industry to improve the sustainability of their endproducts. The findings and recommendations of this research project are important for decision making in policy with regard to the energy strategy  and for industries to improve their sustainability performances, e.g. by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","doc_id":18782,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2229","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Development of the travelling wave bioreactor.

Networks of public-sphere water delivery stations have been proposed as a sustainable alternative for water consumption on-the-go, yet the life-cycle impacts of such stations are poorly understood. Here we evaluate the potential cumulative energy demand and climate change impacts of water delivered from a filtered water refill station under various consumption scenarios and provide a comparison to published results for bottled water. Using a hybrid life-cycle analysis framework employing physical and economic data, we model the water station’s performance in four locations:Tel-Aviv, Israel; Miami Beach, Florida, USA; London, UK; and Shanghai, China. We find that the climate change impact of the station is two to six times lower than those of bottled water and that use phase electricity is the most influential factor in determining the station’s environmental impact.

It is obtained by combining contributions from multiple purely outgoing wave fields. The DtN condition yields an exact non-reflecting boundary condition for the situation, where the computational domain and its exterior artificial boundary consist of several disjoint components. Because each sub-scatterer can be enclosed by a separate artificial boundary, the computational effort is greatly reduced and becomes independent of the relative distances between the different sub-domains. The DtN condition naturally fits into a variational formulation of the boundary-value problem for use with the finite element method. Moreover, it immediately yields as a by-product an exact formula for the far-field pattern of the scattered field. Numerical examples show that the DtN condition for multiple scattering is as accurate as the well-known DtN condition for single scattering problems [J. Comput. Phys.

The large increase in both consumption and fraud, for example through adulteration, creates new challenges and an increasing demand for developing new quality assessment methodologies that are easier and cheaper to perform. As of today, the determination of olive oil quality is performed by producers through chemical analysis and organoleptic evaluation. The chemical analysis requires advanced equipment and chemical knowledge of certified laboratories, and has therefore limited accessibility. In this work a minimalist, portable, and low-cost sensor is presented, which can perform olive oil quality assessment using fluorescence spectroscopy. The potential of the proposed technology is explored by analyzing several olive oils of different quality levels, EVOO, virgin olive oil (VOO), and lampante olive oil (LOO). The spectral data were analyzed using a large number of machine learning methods, including artificial neural networks. The analysis performed in this work demonstrates the possibility of performing the classification of olive oil in the three mentioned classes with an accuracy of %.

A multidisciplinary project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) aimed at fostering innovation along the value chain to reduce the undesirable consequences of the production and consumption of animal foodstuffs was carried out by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) along with various project partners. Part of the project involved social experiments carried out in the campus refectories, which are operated by the SV Group. The objectives of the SV Group are in line with the goals of the SNF research programme: to contribute to healthy and environmentally friendly nutrition. The goal of this subproject was to assess the environmental sustainability of  refectory meals including vegan and vegetarian options as well as meals containing meat or fish.These results of the project will be used to help steer refectory-users towards more sustainable choices, provide guidance to those in the catering industry, and can contribute to a decrease in the environmental impact resulting from the production and consumption of food.Methods: We assessed the environmental impacts of these meals according to these indicators:- Total environmental impact according to a Swiss ecological scarcity method - Greenhouse gas emissions according to IPCC - Ozone depletion, human toxicity, particulate matter, ionising radiation, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, water depletion, and mineral, fossil and renewable resource depletion according to the recommendation of Joint Research Council of the European Commission.The following aspects were considered: the ingredients, including their origin, the composition of any ready-prepared components, the most relevant kitchen appliance energy and material flows, energy requirements for preparation, rinsing and frozen storage in the refectories, freezing and the transport of frozen products, as well as food waste from storage, preparation and serving.Results: In terms of total environmental impact according to the Swiss ecological scarcity method , vegan meals are on average % below the average of all dishes, vegetarian meals % below the average and meals containing meat or fish are % above the average.

This also applies to pregnancy, an incipient phase of the transition to parenthood. Here research shows that the role of managing risks for the foetus lies mainly with the woman. The role of male partners during this  stage,  however, has been underexamined in the sociological literature. Our study focuses on expecting couples and their experience with and perception of alcohol risk during pregnancy, as well as the construction of boundaries between “harmful”,  “risky” and “safe” alcohol consumption habits. To this end, we conducted separate qualitative interviews with  couples living in Switzerland.  Our findings indicate that most expecting parents perceive abstinence, or significant reduction of alcohol consumption, as an integral part of good parenthood. Women in particular, feel responsible for the management of alcohol related risk and  uncertainty, which  involves an on-going monitoring of their daily habits and bodily sensations, as well as navigating conflicting norms within daily life, work, sociability and coupledom. In this ongoing process of risk monitoring, male partners take on a secondary role, referencing information and risk appraisals provided by the women, and sometimes providing support in situations of uncertainty. Most men reduce their alcohol consumption marginally. “Shared abstinence” as a way of supporting the women’s abstinence  efforts, is seen as ideal but unattainable, by some pregnant women, and as ineffectual, by others. Male partners, meanwhile, stress  their willingness to reduce consumption to a similar degree, if asked by their partners.  Ultimately,  we  find  that  the  management  of alcohol risk during pregnancy contributes to the (re)production of gendered norms  of  good  parenthood,  where  the  future  mother  is  primarily  in charge of the child’s health and wellbeing, and the future father inhabits a secondary, supportive role.","doc_id":19531,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"34","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20424","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Managing the paradox : individual ambidexterity, paradoxical leadership and multitasking in entrepreneurs across firm life cycle stages","authors":"Klonek, Florian E.; Volery, Thierry; Parker, Sharon K.","subject":"Ambidexterity; Entrepreneurship; Paradoxical leadership; Exploration;  Leitendes Management","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"658.4","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Managing the paradox : individual ambidexterity, paradoxical leadership and multitasking in entrepreneurs across firm life cycle stages; Ambidexterity; Entrepreneurship; Paradoxical leadership; Exploration;  Leitendes Management; Ambidexterity requires both exploration and exploitation.

In recent times, the concept of smart cities has raised the attention of both scientists and practitioners in different fields. Smart cities are envisioned to link different fields of action such as mobility; energy production, distribution, and consumption; buildings; governance and stakeholder processes; and urban planning. Information and communication technologies are seen as key to these interconnections. The overall goal of a smart city is to save energy and simultaneously to increase the quality of life for inhabitants.Although a broad variety of descriptions of smart cities have been developed, the concept itself appears to be rather fuzzy and hard to grasp. A clear-cut, common definition of smart cities is still lacking. The goal of this paper is to better understand what a smart city constitutes and what it means from the perspective of science, as well as from a practical point of view.In a thorough literature analysis, we identify different i) definitions, ii) approaches, iii) fields of actions and iv) technologies associated with smart cities. Our analysis is based on interdisciplinary scientific literature, as well as on practical documents (e.g. websites of pilot projects). In a subsequent step, we compare the different understandings of smart cities. In so doing, we focus on similarities and differences between scientific and practical approaches. In a final step, we identify opportunities and challenges arising from the identified similarities and differences.Recognising these challenges and potentials is of particular interest for so-called transdisciplinary research in urban development, where scientists and practitioners work closely together. Differences between science and practice might on the one hand inform research on smart cities concerning practical implications and experiences. On the other hand, they can also inform practitioners about scientific innovation in urban development (e.g. cloud computing assessing sensor data in real time).","doc_id":19624,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23115","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Stalking im Jugendalter : Prävalenz und Zusammenhänge mit psychischer Befindlichkeit","authors":"Kliem, Sören; Krieg, Yvonne; Baier, Dirk","subject":"Stalking; Prävalenz; Schülerbefragung; Niedersachsensurvey; Prevalence rate; Student survey; Lower Saxony survey;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Kriminologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"305, 364","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Stalking im Jugendalter : Prävalenz und Zusammenhänge mit psychischer Befindlichkeit; Stalking in adolescence : prevalence and correlations with mental health; Stalking; Prävalenz; Schülerbefragung; Niedersachsensurvey; Prevalence rate; Student survey; Lower Saxony survey;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen);  Kriminologie; Die elektronischen Supplemente sind mit der Online-Version dieses Artikels verfügbar unter https://doi.org/./-/a- ESM .Flowchart des Niedersachsensurveys ; Theoretischer Hintergrund: Die Folgen für Betroffene von Stalking reichen von der Beeinträchtigung des sozialen Wohlbefindens über negative wirtschaftliche Folgen bis hin zu gesundheitlichen und psychischen Problemen.Fragestellung: Diese Studie präsentiert erstmalig die Lebenszeitprävalenz für die Opferwerdung von Stalking unter deutschen Jugendlichen und berichtet Zusammenhängemit der psychischen Befindlichkeit.Methode: Daten einer repräsentativen Schüler_innenbefragung in Niedersachsen werden mittels T-Tests und χ-Test überprüft.Ergebnisse: Die Ergebnisse weisen auf eine Prävalenz von .% von Stalking hin, die bei Mädchen und Jugendlichen höher ausfällt als bei Jungen und Erwachsenen. Betroffene leiden häufiger unter psychischen Problemen und problematischem Substanzkonsum als Nicht-Betroffene.Diskussion und Schlussfolgerung: Folglich sollten Schüler_innen über Stalking sowie dessen strafrechtliche Konsequenzen und gezielte Unterstützung der Betroffenen aufgeklärt werden.; Theoretical background: According to various definitions, stalking is the intentional, repeated, and prolonged pattern of behavior that focuses on persecution, unwanted contact, advances, and harassment of a particular person. According to the police crime statistics,, stalking offenses were recorded in Germany in , with , suspects (including  adolescents) and , victims (including  adolescents) of these crimes being identified. However, one may presume a considerable number of unreported cases. The consequences for those affected by stalking range from impairment of social well-being and negative economic consequences to health and psychological problems.Objective: While there are first representative results regarding stalking experiences of adults in Germany, no such study among German adolescents is known so far. For this reason, this article is the first to determine the lifetime prevalence of stalking among German adolescents and to compare it with a sample of adults. In addition, it determines correlations with psychological well-being and problematic substance consumption.Method: The data of the present study originated from a representative survey of pupils in the federal state of Lower Saxony, in which in  , pupils gave information about their stalking experiences (sample: .% male, .%migration background, mean age . years). The adult study is a representative victimization study on (sexual) violence experiences of N=, - to -year-olds in Germany, conducted in  (.% female, average age M= . years, SD= .; .% migration background).Recording of stalking experiences was based on other epidemiological studies by specifying  different individual behaviors. In estimating the lifetime prevalence of stalking, we chose a more liberal operationalization (i.e., experiencing at least one behavior at least twice). We assessed the group differences and correlations using T-tests and theχ-test and their corresponding effect sizes.Results: The results show a lifetime prevalence of .%, with girls being more affected than boys. In addition, those affected by stalking suffer more frequently from depression, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal tendencies and show higher rates of problematic substance consumption (alcohol and cannabis) than those unaffected. Again, these correlations are more evident in girls than in boys. Compared to the adult general population, adolescents are more affected by almost all stalking behaviors; this difference is particularly apparent in cyberstalking.Discussion and conclusion: In practice, it seems to make sense to educate students about stalking and the disregard of boundaries in partnerships. In addition, the criminal consequences of stalking should be explained, and it should be discussed how stalking can best be documented. Suitable contact persons should be named, and targeted support for those affected should be ensured.","doc_id":19629,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22035","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Linguistic recycling : the process of quoting in increasingly mediatized settings","authors":"Haapanen, Lauri; Perrin, Daniel","subject":" Rhetorik und Schreiben","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"808","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Linguistic recycling : the process of quoting in increasingly mediatized settings;  Rhetorik und Schreiben","doc_id":19686,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"33","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5927","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Verpackung gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung","authors":"Yildirim, Selçuk; Miescher, Susanna","subject":"Verpackung; Packaging; Food waste;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"664","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Verpackung gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung; Verpackung; Packaging; Food waste;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","doc_id":19726,"prior":"Lebensmittelverschwendung","sdg12":1},{"id":"10","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18308","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"«Ohne Smartphone?

Die vorliegende empirische Arbeit befasst sich mit der Bedeutung des Smartphones für das persönliche Wohlbefinden von weiblichen Jugendlichen im Alter von  bis  Jahren sowie deren Vorstellungen von einer Zeit des Verzichts auf das Smartphone. Das Forschungsinteresse liegt in der subjektiven Sichtweise der Jugendlichen selbst, weshalb vier Jugendliche einerseits durch ein Tagebuch, anderseits mittels eines halbstandardisierten Leitfadeninterviews befragt wurden.

In diabetics, both angiogenesis and wound contraction are diminished leading to impaired wound healing. To emulate this pathology and to address it pharmacologically, we developed a wound healing model in the diabetic Zucker fatty rat and tested a topical proangiogenic strategy combining antifungal agent ciclopirox olamine (CPX) and lysophospholipid sphingosine‐‐phosphate (SP) to promote diabetic wound closure. In vitro, we demonstrated that CPX + SP up‐regulates a crucial driver of angiogenesis, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐, in endothelial cells. Injection of CPX + SP into subcutaneously implanted sponges in experimental rats showed, in an additive manner, a fivefold increased endothelial infiltration and lectin‐perfused vessel length. We developed a splinted diabetic rodent model to achieve low wound contraction rates that are characteristic for the healing mode of diabetic ulcers in humans. We discovered specific dorsal sites that allowed for incremental full‐thickness excisional wound depths from  mm (superficial) to  mm (deep). This enabled us to bring down wound contraction from % in superficial wounds to % in deep wounds. While the effects of topical gel treatment of CPX + SP were masked by the rodent‐characteristic dominant contraction in superficial wounds, they became clearly evident in deep diabetic wounds. Here, a fivefold increase of functional large vessels resulted in accelerated granulation tissue formulation, accompanied by a % increase of compacted thick collagen fibers. This was associated with substantially reduced matrix metalloproteinase‐ and ‐ expression. These findings translated into a fivefold increase in granulation‐driven contraction, promoting diabetic wound closure. With CPX and SP analogues already in clinical use, their combination presents itself as an attractive proangiogenic treatment to be repurposed for diabetic wound healing.","doc_id":19822,"prior":"granulation","sdg12":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/4381","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"On the economics of asset management","authors":"Heitz, Christoph; Goren Huber, Lilach","subject":"Physical asset management; Investment strategy; Asset portfolio; Value creation;  Produktionssteuerung","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.5","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"On the economics of asset management; Physical asset management; Investment strategy; Asset portfolio; Value creation;  Produktionssteuerung; Asset Management is about realizing value from physical assets.

Six materials, shale, pumice, porous glass, quartz sand, activated carbon and anthracite were used as carriers for the biofilm. The reactors were operated in parallel for several months with vapour condensate from a sulfite cellulose process as feed. The criteria used for the evaluation were: a) Reproducibility of the reactor performance, b) performance of the different carriers under various loading rates, c) stability against toxic shock loadings using ,,-trichlorophenol (TCP) as toxicant, d) recovery capacity after intoxication and starvation, e) adsorption/desorption behavior of the carriers.A comparison between four runs showed good reproducibility of the steady state removal rates. The performance of the reactors and the stability of the degradation rates were tested for a range of loading conditions. Unbuffered, buffered and pH controlled conditions were compared. The pumice carrier was best with respect to the degradation rate achieved per carrier mass. The response of the reactors to massive TCP step loadings was tested. Loadings less than . kg TCP/md resulted in initially normal gas production rates for all the systems, except the activated carbon, whose gas production was partially inhibited from the start. After increasing the load to . kg TCP/md the gas production rates of all the other reactors fell abruptly to zero. Restarting after  months, all reactors showed methanogenic activity without requiring new inoculum.Adsorption and desorption experiments with TCP showed that only the anthracite and activated carbon adsorbed appreciable amounts. The activated carbon had the greatest adsorption capacity but did not release the TCP by desorption, as did the anthracite.A bicomponent (pumice and anthracite) carrier mixture was compared in biological experiments with pumice and anthracite carrier alone, with and without TCP loading. The pumice and the carrier-mix performed equally well under non-toxic-loading conditions. With TCP toxic loading, the performance of the anthracite was superior. The anthracite carrier could be regenerated, owing mainly to its capacity for desorption.","doc_id":20231,"prior":"water treatment","sdg12":1},{"id":"13","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12175","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Time-resolved gravimetric method to assess degassing of roasted coffee","authors":"Smrke, Samo; Wellinger, Marco; Suzuki, Tomonori; Balsiger, Franz; Opitz, Sebastian E.

Part of these gases is released during roasting while part is retained inside the porous structure of the roasted beans and is steadily released during storage or more abruptly during grinding and extraction. The release of CO during the various phases from roasting to consumption is linked to many important properties and characteristics of coffee. It is an indicator for freshness, plays an important role in shelf life and in packaging, impacts the extraction process, is involved in crema formation, and may affect the sensory profile in the cup. Indeed, and in view of the multiple roles it plays, CO is a much underappreciated and little examined molecule in coffee. Here, we introduce an accurate, quantitative, and time-resolved method to measure the release kinetics of gases from whole beans and ground coffee using a gravimetric approach. Samples were placed in a container with a fitted capillary to allow gases to escape. The time-resolved release of gases was measured via the weight loss of the container filled with coffee. Long-term stability was achieved using a customized design of a semimicro balance, including periodic and automatic zero value measurements and calibration procedures. The novel gravimetric methodology was applied to a range of coffee samples: (i) whole Arabica beans and (ii) ground Arabica and Robusta, roasted to different roast degrees and at different speeds (roast air temperatures).

The analysis of five main land use types with a geographic information system (GIS) revealed that the arid coastal landscape has been dramatically transformed during the past decades due to the increase of mass tourism and the intensification of agriculture, resulting in a large-scale destruction of the coastal scrub, the natural, endemic-rich vegetation. Between  and , the area occupied by irrigated crops increased strongly due to the transition from tomato to banana production. During the same period of time, the amount of abandoned farmland as well as the area used for housing and infrastructure increased markedly, the latter by more than  times. In nature reserves, most of the natural vegetation has survived but only in a degraded state, mainly due to recreation activities and illegal waste dumping. In unprotected areas, by contrast, % of the natural vegetation was lost between  and , and % of the native vegetation of recent lava flows. The results show that the current practice of protecting comparatively small natural areas is not sufficient to stop the massive destruction of natural vegetation.

In the exhibition, research findings about the environmental relevance of private consumption from the Life Cycle Assessment Research Group at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) are presented in various scenes. They represent the choices we make every day, such as commuting by bike, train, or car pool? Elevator or stairs? Meatloaf or tofu curry? While going through the exhibition, visitors personalise their experience by using the accompanying Web App. This Web App, similar to a ‘personality test’ in popular magazines, can be used to record the individual habits and choices by interacting with different objects in the exhibition. According to each visitor’s choices, an “environmental personality type” is determined that outlines the visitors’ values and attitude towards the environment. At the end of the visit, personalised advice for a more sustainable way of living that fits the visitors’ personality is provided. Visitors can decide to share their anonymised data, which will allow the scientists of the ZHAW to refine their future research projects. The exhibition is targeted at an audience with low prior interest in science or environmental issues. It offers a fun and entertaining experience with many hands-on activities, focusing more on what one can do in everyday life than on imminent dangers or gloomy consequences in the future. Special ‘meet the scientist’ events offer visitors the opportunity to challenge and discuss their choices and the resulting environmental impact with an expert. This improves the credibility and validity of the presented results. At the same time, these tours increase the scientists’ understanding of the possibilities and constraints of Swiss consumers. The interactive exhibition allows visitors to experience the effects of their everyday decisions on the environment.

The aim of this study is to present the approximated overall and sex-specific cumulative incidence of mental disorder in the Zurich cohort study, a prospective cohort study of - years olds from the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, who were followed through age . A stratified sample of  participants were interviewed with the Structured Psychopathological Interview and Rating of the Social Consequences of Psychological Disturbances for Epidemiology, a semi-structured interview that uses a bottom-up approach to assess the past-year presence of  psychiatric syndromes. Seven interview waves took place between  and . Approximated cumulative incidence was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Rates of mental disorder were considerably higher than those generally reported in cross-sectional surveys. We found rates ranging from .% for major depressive disorder to .% for Bipolar I disorder. The cumulative probability of experiencing any of the mental disorders assessed by age  was .%, the highest reported to date. We also found that rates differed by sex for most disorders, with females generally reporting higher rates of mood, anxiety and phobic disorder, and males reporting higher rates of substance- and alcohol-related disorders. These findings confirm those of other long-term prospective studies that indicate the nearly universal nature of disturbances of emotion and behaviour across the life span. Greater community awareness of the normative nature of these experiences is warranted. An important area of future research is study long-term course and stability to determine who among those with such disturbances suffer from chronic disabling mental disorders. Such longitudinal studies may aid in directing services and intervention efforts where they are most needed.","doc_id":20770,"prior":"life span","sdg12":1},{"id":"69","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24892","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Characterisation of meat consumption across sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric groups in Switzerland : results from the National Nutrition Survey menuCH","authors":"Tschanz, Linda; Kaelin, Ivo; Wróbel, Anna; Rohrmann, Sabine; Sych, Janice Marie","subject":"Switzerland; Dietary survey; Meat consumption; Meat determinants; menuCH;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613.2, 614","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Characterisation of meat consumption across sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric groups in Switzerland : results from the National Nutrition Survey menuCH; Switzerland; Dietary survey; Meat consumption; Meat determinants; menuCH;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; Objective: Characterising meat consumption in Switzerland across sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric groups.Design: Representative national data from the menuCH survey (two -hour dietary recalls, anthropometric measurements and a lifestyle questionnaire) was used to analyse the total average daily intake of meat and main meat categories.

Highest concentration of cytoplasmic TetR and best repression of tetO-controlled genes was obtained by tetR expression from the synthetic promoter Pt. Anhydrotetracycline (ATc) as inducer permitted concentration-dependent, fine-tuned expression of genes under control of the tetO operator and a suitable promoter. The actin-polymerizing ActA protein represents a major virulence factor of L. monocytogenes, required for actin-based motility and cell-to-cell spread in infected host cells. To be able to observe its spatial and temporal distribution on intracellular L. monocytogenes cells, conditional mutants featuring actA placed under TetR control were used to infect PtK epithelial cells. Following induction at different time intervals, the subsequent recruitment of actin by L. monocytogenes could be monitored. We found that cells displayed functional ActA after approximately  min, while formation of polarized actin tail was complete after - min. At this point, intracellular motility of the induced mutants was indistinguishable from wild-type bacteria. Interestingly, de novo ActA synthesis in intracellular Listeria also demonstrated the temporal, asymmetric redistribution of the membrane-anchored proteins from the lateral walls toward the cell poles.","doc_id":20809,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23623","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Nutzen statt besitzen - die Psychologie hinter der Kreislaufwirtschaft : Vorlesung gehalten an der Volkshochschule Winterthur und Umgebung (VHS), 24.

It improves the knowledge on transition patterns of distributed generation concepts and the interplaying network effects. Network effects between technologies, the installed base and the investment decision criteria are important elements in the transition dynamics. A System Dynamics simulation model is built, capturing the consumption concepts related to distributed generation, as well as arising network effects, to analyse the likely transition patterns of regional energy systems.

Technology has made it possible for peers which have never met before to now trust each other. However, trust is still seen as a major barrier to participate in the sharing economy. Sharing economy platforms try to overcome this obstacle by so called trust-increasing measures such as ratings, reviews etc.The effectiveness of such measures has yet not fully been researched. Most studies were conducted in the United States and focused on specific measures in the context of specific sharing platforms. Furthermore, only limited research about new tools is available. These major gaps in existing research call for additional studies providing a larger picture on the effectiveness of trust-increasing measures. Therefore, this thesis examines the effectiveness of several already established, but also new tools that PP sharing economy platforms can use in order to increase trust. The analysis focused on the trust building relation from a consumer perspective towards the private offeror of a product/service. The thesis provides information to startups and already existing sharing platforms about the importance of trust and how it can be increased.The analysis has shown that the importance of trust is perceived at a higher level if peers take the role of the offeror of the product/service rather than being on the consumer side. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role if the shared product or service touches the private sphere or not. The study also revealed that trust-increasing measures can be highly effective. This can be observed by the fact that people can trust a host from a sharing economy platform more than their neighbor or colleague. It became apparent during the study that conventional trust-increasing measures such as verification of the identity, the offeror’s certificates (i.e. trusted host), ratings, reviews etc., had a strong positive effect on trust. Links to social media accounts of the offeror had the smallest effect on trust. Additionally, the study made clear that the effectiveness of trust-increasing measures also depends on various other characteristics and features.","doc_id":21204,"prior":"sharing economy","sdg12":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21771","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Coffee cherry flavour","authors":"Jiménez, María Julia; Fernández Valdez, Yara Carolina; Jacobi, Johanna; Yeretzian, Chahan","subject":"Coffee cherry; Sultana; Slow food; Recipe;  Produktion;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Buch","bid":"338, 630","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Coffee cherry flavour; Coffee cherry; Sultana; Slow food; Recipe;  Produktion;  Landwirtschaft; In the context of this publication, three videos had been created:- Sultana in Coroico, Bolivia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmZHCeRE- Sultana in Caranavi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kilgRgyXPQ- Sultana pasta with saucages and mushrooms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTwayDtyU; This work is the result of a partnership between an SNIS Project (Swiss Network for International Studies) and the Slow Food Bolivia movement, as part of the project for Improving Rural Livelihoods through Promoting High-quality Coffee and Coffee Cherry Products in the Origin Countries Colombia and Bolivia In collaboration with local project partners, the potential to market high-quality coffee and sultana products and improve livelihoods in two Latin American countries was studied.

It remains to be shown whether this also applies to substances such as tobacco and cannabis and if the “healthier” patterns of consumption are permanent or if they gradually disappear as the level of integration increases. Using representative data, the current study was designed to a) present the epidemiology of the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis of adolescents with and without an immigration background in  and b) to analyze which immigration-specific variables predict problematic alcohol consumption in adolescents with an immigration background.Methods: A representative, written survey was administered to  students in the th grade from Lower Saxony, Germany in  by the “Kriminologisches Forschungsinstitut Niedersachsen (KfN).” Data were collected from  adolescents with an immigration background regarding their cultural, structural, social, and identificative integration. These variables were introduced as predictors in a multiple logistic regression analysis with binge drinking during the last  days as the dependent variable.Results: Compared with German adolescents without an immigration background, significantly fewer adolescents with an immigration background had already tried alcohol, but they were significantly more likely to report experience with cigarettes and cannabis. In the group of adolescents with an immigration background, the percentage of binge drinkers fluctuated by country of origin (p < .). In the regression model, binge drinking was associated with a lower targeted school leaving certificate (p < .), not living on social welfare (p = .), and the strong assimilation (p = .) of the adolescent. Binge drinking was negatively associated with attitudes that favored segregation (p < .) and a stronger attachment of the parents to the traditions of their country of origin (p = .).Conclusions: It cannot be confirmed that adolescents with an immigration background generally show less harmful patterns of consumption.

Projected results are an ontology of product data resources and an enhanced understanding of their usage in creating and maintaining digital twins.","doc_id":21545,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"89","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18598","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Testing with fewer resources : an adaptive approach to performance-aware test case generation","authors":"Grano, Giovanni; Laaber, Christoph; Panichella, Annibale; Panichella, Sebastiano","subject":" Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"005","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Testing with fewer resources : an adaptive approach to performance-aware test case generation;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; ​©  IEEE.

While the majority of research effort has been devoted to satisfying coverage criteria, a recent trend emerged towards optimizing other non-coverage aspects. In this regard, runtime and memory usage are two essential dimensions: less expensive tests reduce the resource demands for the generation process and later regression testing phases. This study shows that performance-aware test case generation requires solving two main challenges: providing a good approximation of resource usage with minimal overhead and avoiding detrimental effects on both final coverage and fault detection effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, we conceived a set of performance proxies-inspired by previous work on performance testing- that provide a reasonable estimation of the test execution costs (i.e., runtime and memory usage). Thus, we propose an adaptive strategy, called aDynaMOSA, which leverages these proxies by extending DynaMOSA, a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm in unit testing. Our empirical study-involving  non-trivial Java classes- reveals that our adaptive approach generates test suite with statistically significant improvements in runtime (-%) and heap memory consumption (-%) compared to DynaMOSA. Additionally, aDynaMOSA has comparable results to DynaMOSA over seven different coverage criteria and similar fault detection effectiveness. Our empirical investigation also highlights that the usage of performance proxies (i.e., without the adaptiveness) is not sufficient to generate more performant test cases without compromising the overall coverage.","doc_id":21588,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18137","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Sustainable tourism design based on a life cycle assessment of tourism activities in Thailand","authors":"Prapasponga, Trakarn; Keller, Regula; Stucki, Matthias; Suskerm, Supanut; Chumpanya, Thornwarot; Chaiwat, Weerawut","subject":"LCA; Tourism;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"338.927","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Sustainable tourism design based on a life cycle assessment of tourism activities in Thailand; LCA; Tourism;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Tourism is an important and rapidly-expanding economic sector globally.

Increasing energy efficiency not only helps to slow down climate change, but also reduces the amount of money spent on primary energy. The objective of this study was to compare different methods of determining the energy consumption during the bread baking process. In the first part, energy consumption was measured experimentally in an electrically heated rack oven. The difference between standard trials and trials with no product in the oven identified the energy absorbed by the bread and trials with the empty oven demonstrated the total energy loss. The second part of this study incorporated a specific calculation to determine how much energy is required to raise the temperature of the bread and dry the crust. This value, called benchmark, described the minimum energy requirement. The measured energy consumption for baking in a rack oven is  kJ/kg of bread. The corresponding energy benchmark (physical minimum) is  kJ/kg, % of this energy is used for the evaporation of water. The efficiency is calculated by .%. Results showed that the bread baking process is not efficient, needing twice as much of energy as the calculated benchmark.

A further reason is the possibility of speeding up VLP vaccine manufacturing by implementing single-use (SU) technology in the case of mammalian and insect-cell-based processes, for which a multitude of SU devices up to middle-volume scale already exist. After briefly introducing the vaccine types and expression systems currently in use, this chapter turns to VLP vaccines and the insect cell/baculovirus expression vector system (IC/BEVS).

After answering the questions, visitors receive detailed information on their environmental impact as well as personalised tips, customised for each profile, explaining how they can reduce their impact. The median yearly environmental impact resulting from nutrition varied between socioeconomic profiles, ranging from .-. million eco-points per person. The difference between groups is not particularly large, but there is a considerable difference between individuals: there is an almost three-fold difference between the lowest and highest nutrition-related impact. Visitors with the lowest nutrition-related impacts tend to consume little to no meat, milk products, wine, and coffee and rarely waste food and those with high impacts consume these products more frequently and waste food more regularly. The nutrition-related impact is higher for omnivores than for vegetarians and vegans. The environmental impact resulting from nutrition tended to be slightly lower for environmentally aware participants and female visitors tended to have slightly lower nutrition-related environmental impacts than males.There are only small differences in the nutrition-related environmental impact of the socioeconomic groups, but a large range within the groups, indicating that other factors play a larger role. The large range of impacts resulting from nutrition indicates that there is significant improvement potential in this area.","doc_id":21828,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18687","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The influence of non-transactional engagement behavior on merchandise consumption","authors":"Hüttermann, Marcel; Kunkel, Thilo","subject":" Kultur","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"306","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"The influence of non-transactional engagement behavior on merchandise consumption;  Kultur; Fan engagement has received increased academic and practitioner attention because of its ability to influence organization-consumer relationships.

Wie Umfragen zeigen, gewinnt das Kriterium \"Zustand der Umwelt am Urlaubsort\" bei der Reisezielentscheidung an Bedeutung (vgl. bspw. Müller/ Kaspar/Schmidhauser , S. ). Dennoch sind die meisten Touristen nicht bereit, sich auch noch im wohlverdienten Urlaub um Umweltbelange zu kümmern. Dieser vermeintliche Widerspruch - Touristen wollen eine unversehrte Natur gewährleistet sehen, sich selber in den Ferien hingegen nicht einschränken - löst sich in Form einer impliziten Verantwortungsdelegation auf, indem das Thema Umweltschutz zur Sache der Reiseveranstalter und Tourismusanbieter ernannt wird. Eine  von der Fachgruppe \"Umwelt und Soziales\" des Schweizerischen Reisebüro- Verbandes (SRV) durchgeführte Umfrage zeigt, dass sich die Tourismusanbieter dieser Verantwortungsdelegation nicht bewusst sind, die ökologischen Potentiale nicht erkennen und zudem das Umweltbewusstsein der Reisenden unterschätzen (vgl. SRV ). Mit dem  gestarteten Projekt \"ökologisch aktiv - ökonomisch erfolgreich\" hat sich die SRV-Fachgruppe \"Umwelt und Soziales\" das Ziel gesetzt, die Wahrnehmungsdiskrepanz zwischen der Angebots- und der Nachfrageseite zu verringern. In Zusammenarbeit mit dem Institut für Wirtschaft und Ökologie an der Universität St. Gallen (IWÖ-HSG) wurde ein Projektdesign erstellt, dessen Umsetzung die Tourismusangebotsseite für Umweltschutzbelange sensibilisieren und letztlich in konkreten Produkten und Taten münden soll. In einem zweiten Schritt soll die Öffentlichkeit über die Projektresultate informiert werden. Das Sensibilisierungsziel wurde Ende Juni in einem ersten Workshop im Hotel Bethanien in Davos verfolgt.

Aim and approach usedIncreased energy supply from photovoltaics is a main priority in the “Energy Strategy ”. Within the joint research project \"Next generation photovoltaics\" funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, we analysed different options for the enhanced integration of photovoltaic technologies into the envelope of Swiss buildings (BIPV). The PV modules for building integration are using novel monolithic silicon heterojunction organometallic perovskite tandem cells (SHJ-PSC) with adaptions to improve the visual acceptance. In a joint effort of product developers, architects and scientists, this project aimed at providing pathways for the wide-scale use of BIPV façade solutions, and developing integrated designs based on emerging high-efficiency module technologies to improve the visual aspect and acceptance of PV systems installed in Switzerland. These so-called active façades incorporating BIPV modules to generate electricity can provide a significant contribution to the energy transition away from fossil and nuclear fuels. We compared the environmental impacts of different façade construction systems with and without SHJ-PSC BIPV modules with improved visual design, using a prospective life cycle assessment with a time horizon of . The comparison includes a conventional brick and roughcast façade, a timber frame façade, and the Advanced Active Façade (AAF), which integrates SHJ-PSC BIPV modules in a low embodied impact façade substructure. In addition, we compared the environmental impacts caused by the construction of the above described façades with the environmental impacts saved due to the electricity produced by BIPV modules incorporated into the AAF.. Scientific innovation and relevanceOur research focuses on the combined expertise of life cycle thinking, PV module development and façade design. The major scientific innovations are: ) the prospective life cycle assessment of novel monolithic silicon heterojunction organometallic perovskite tandem cells (SHJ-PSC); ) the comparison of different façade construction systems and their environmental impacts; ) the quantification of the saved environmental impacts arising from the electricity generated by the active façade; and ) the visual adjustments of PV modules to improve their acceptance. The main advantage of integrating PV into building façades is the large available area, which can be limited on rooftops. In order to reach the market penetration for PV required for the energy transition, PV modules must be integrated into façades as well as into rooftops.. Results and conclusionsAn equilibrium must be achieved among different technical and aesthetic issues when integrating energy generation systems into the building envelope, especially into the façade for its public condition and exposure. Based on these prerequisites, the research team has developed the AAF which combines passive and active energy design strategies while meeting contemporary architectural requirements. This façade design is based on low-embodied-energy construction principles, it is defined by a non-loadbearing wood-panel substructure and it integrates a double layer of natural insulation: cellulose and wood-fibre. In addition, its design incorporates an opaque SHJ-PSC BIPV façade-cladding following contemporary façade design trends. (Figure ). The use of photovoltaic modules integrated into the façade cladding or roof will increase the environmental impact of the building envelope, compared to using conventional construction materials. The environmental impacts of the AAF using PV modules are two to four times higher compared to a conventional façade. The PV modules cause the highest share of greenhouse gas emissions of the AAF with about  kg CO-eq per square meter (see Figure ). The additional materials required to build the AAF including exterior panels, insulation and other materials cause about  kg CO-eq per square meter of façade. The brick and timber frame façades cause greenhouse gas emissions around  and  kg CO-eq, respectively. If the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the PV module is excluded this will result in a reduction between  and  kg CO-eq per square meter of façade.However, the environmental impacts of the AAF are significantly reduced if the whole life cycle is considered due to the PV electricity produced by the building. Therefore, we calculated the saved greenhouse gas emissions due to the electricity produced by the advanced active façade and fed to the European electricity grid using the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the current European electricity mix as reference. These calculated savings due to the electricity produced by the BIPV are about  times higher than the impacts of the advanced active façade. Incorporating BIPV panels into building’s façades will cause net savings of about  kg CO-eq per square meter over the whole life cycle of BIPV façades, while simultaneously saving up to  kg CO-eq per square meter of façade for the reduced material demand to build the façade (see Figure ). We performed this analysis for  different environmental impacts according to the recommended midpoints by the Joint Research Council of the European Commission. The results were comparable to greenhouse gas emissions with the net saved environmental impacts being many times higher for all the environmental impacts analysed except mineral resource use caused by the indium used in the novel SHJ-PSC tandem module (see Figure ).To conclude, the use of PV modules in AAF can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions per square meter of façade between  and  % if the production of the PV module and its produced electricity are excluded. If the production and life cycle of the PV modules are included into the analysis the AAF will cause net greenhouse gas savings up to four times higher than the production of the AAF itself. The results for environmental impacts other than greenhouse gases were similar except for mineral resource depletion. Overall, the building integration of photovoltaic modules as AAF will reduce the environmental impacts of the building while simultaneously providing a visually appealing building envelope.","doc_id":22091,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20960","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Pyrolysis of dry toilet substrate as a means of nutrient recycling in agricultural systems : potential risks and benefits","authors":"Bleuler, Mira; Gold, Moritz; Strande, Linda; Schönborn, Andreas","subject":"Biochar; Dry toilet; Pyrolysis; Germination test; Nutrient recycling; Sanitation;  Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"540","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Pyrolysis of dry toilet substrate as a means of nutrient recycling in agricultural systems : potential risks and benefits; Biochar; Dry toilet; Pyrolysis; Germination test; Nutrient recycling; Sanitation;  Chemie; Biochar is increasingly being applied as a soil amendment in agriculture. Biochar is typically produced from plant biomass and contains relatively low amounts of plant nutrients (e.g., N, P, and K), thus providing limited fertilizer value. Human excreta contains plant nutrients that could be recycled to create sustainable agricultural nutrient cycles. This study investigated the potential of biochar derived from a dry toilet substrate as soil amendment. The substrate consisted of urine, faeces, and wood chips, and was pyrolyzed at – °C for  min. The biochar was analyzed for plant available P, water leachable P and K, carbon stability, pH, electrical conductivity, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and germination tests with barley and lettuce were conducted to estimate the biochar fertilizer value and potential bio-toxicity. The biochar contained . ± . g N/kg dry mass (DM), . ± . g P/kg DM and . ± . g K/kg DM. % DM P was extractable by formic acid solution, .% DM P and .% DM K were water leachable in a ten-day column water-leaching experiment. The biochar complied with European regulations for PAHs, PCBs, dioxins and heavy metal concentrations, except for Zn and Ni. Germination of salt-resistant barley was not affected by biochar doses < % DM, while salt-sensitive lettuce germination was inhibited at doses ≥ % DM, indicating that the dry toilet substrate biochar induced salt stress. Based on these results, it is recommended that urine separation should be considered for biochar of excreta, which could reduce salt stress while maintaining concentrations of “fixed” or bioavailable nitrogen.","doc_id":22173,"prior":"recycling","sdg12":1},{"id":"88","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22873","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Die Bedeutung von Individualität in der Biomastschweinehaltung : wie nutzen unterschiedliche Tiere einer Gruppe den angebotenen Auslauf?","authors":"Bühl, Verena","subject":"Mastschweine; Schweinehaltung; Biologische Landwirtschaft; Nutztierhaltung; Auslaufnutzung; Individualität; Ethologie;  Tiere (Zoologie);  Landwirtschaft","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"590, 630","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Die Bedeutung von Individualität in der Biomastschweinehaltung : wie nutzen unterschiedliche Tiere einer Gruppe den angebotenen Auslauf?; Mastschweine; Schweinehaltung; Biologische Landwirtschaft; Nutztierhaltung; Auslaufnutzung; Individualität; Ethologie;  Tiere (Zoologie);  Landwirtschaft; In der Bio-Mastschweinehaltung ist ein permanent zugänglicher Auslauf zwingend vorgeschrieben.

Here, we report the first application of a small molecule-type thermosensitive fluorescent dye, ERthermAC, to monitor thermogenesis in BAs derived from murine brown fat precursors and in human brown fat cells differentiated from human neck brown preadipocytes. ERthermAC accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum of BAs and displayed a marked change in fluorescence intensity in response to adrenergic stimulation of cells, which corresponded to temperature change. ERthermAC fluorescence intensity profiles were congruent with mitochondrial depolarisation events visualised by the JC- probe. Moreover, the averaged fluorescence intensity changes across a population of cells correlated well with dynamic changes such as thermal power, oxygen consumption, and extracellular acidification rates. These findings suggest ERthermAC as a promising new tool for studying thermogenic function in brown adipocytes of both murine and human origins.","doc_id":22365,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3417","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Aquaponic systems : nutrient recycling from fish wastewater by vegetable production","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Vegetables; Fish; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Aquaponic systems : nutrient recycling from fish wastewater by vegetable production; Aquaponics; Vegetables; Fish; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft; This chapter describes the possibility to combine wastewater treatment in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with the production of crop plants biomass.

Während sich innerhalb der Branche der Preiswettbewerb verschärft, nehmen gleichzeitig die Anforderungen an die eingesetzten Produktionsmittel und die Qualität der Produkte zu. Dazu kommt die Abhängigkeit von wenigen Detailhändlern sowie vermehrte Kritik an den Arbeitsbedingungen in der Produktion. Die vorliegende Arbeit analysiert in diesem Kontext eine spezifische Lieferkette: die des Schweizer Eisbergsalats. Sie geht dabei der Frage nach, wie die Lieferkette organisiert ist und wie sich die Beziehungen der Akteure untereinander gestalten. Ausserdem untersucht sie die Arbeitsbedingungen von Hilfskräften in der Produktion und der Verarbeitung. Als Methode wurde eine Mischung aus  Leitfadeninterviews und einer teilnehmenden Beobachtung gewählt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der bereits bestehende Preiswettbewerb innerhalb des geschützten Schweizer Gemüsemarktes seit dem Eintritt der Discounter Aldi und Lidl auf allen Ebenen der Lieferkette zugenommen hat. Der Preiswettbewerb und die Anforderungen an die Qualität des Produktes führen zu Zentralisierungs-, Spezialisierungs- und Verdrängungstendenzen in der Lieferkette: Die Detail- und Grosshändler zentralisierten ihre Einkaufsabteilungen, optimieren die gesamte Lieferkette, schalten teilweise den Zwischenhandel aus und geben einen Teil des Preisdruckes an die Verarbeiter und Produzenten weiter. Auf der anderen Seite setzen sich in der Produktion grosse, spezialisierte und mechanisierte Betriebe durch. Insbesondere zwischen diesen grossen Produzenten und den Händlern scheint die Abhängigkeit teilweise gegenseitig, die Macht also nicht nur auf Seiten der wenigen Detail- und Grosshändler. In Bezug auf die Arbeitsbedingungen der Hilfskräfte in der Produktion zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass die Wahrnehmung der Arbeitsbedingungen je nach Anstellungsdauer und Lebensumständen variiert. Die Arbeitsbedingungen in der Schweizer Landwirtschaft sind gesetzlich nur wenig reguliert. Alle Hilfskräfte beurteilen die langen Arbeitszeiten von im Winter bis zu , im Sommer bis zu über  Stunden pro Woche, negativ. Den tiefen Lohn beurteilen diejenigen Hilfskräfte (die Hilfskräfte sind hautsächlich Migrant*innen), die nur temporär in der Schweiz sind, als gut, diejenigen, die hier seit Jahren leben und Familie haben, als zu gering. Insgesamt beurteilen die jüngeren, nur wenige Monate im Gemüsebau Beschäftigten ihre Arbeit positiver als die langjährig als Hilfskraft tätigen. Die Beziehungen mit ihren Vorgesetzten beschreiben alle Hilfskräfte als gut. Die Ergebnisse zeigen auch, dass der Gestaltungsraum für Verbesserungen der Arbeitsbedingungen für die Hilfskräfte sehr klein ist. Auf Grund des Preiswettbewerbs und der hohen Personalkosten, die im arbeitsintensiven Gemüsebau einen wichtigen Teil des Produktpreises ausmachen, ist auch der Gestaltungsraum der Produzenten begrenzt. Es stellt sich also die Frage, was für Möglichkeiten es ausserhalb der Lieferkette gäbe, die Arbeitsbedingungen der Hilfskräfte zu verbessern.Abstract:The Swiss vegetable sector is facing various challenges. While price competition is intensifying within the sector, the demands on the means of production and the quality of the products are increasing. In addition, the sector is dependent of a few retailers and there is rising criticism of the working conditions in production. In this context, this paper analyses a specific supply chain: the Swiss iceberg lettuce supply chain. The study examines how the supply chain is organised and how the actors involved relate to each other. It also examines the working conditions of wage workers in production and processing. The method chosen was a mixture of  guided interviews and field observation. The results show that the already existing price competition within the protected Swiss vegetable market has increased at all levels of the supply chain since the entry of the discounters Aldi and Lidl. The price competition and the demands on the quality of the product lead to centralisation-, specialisation- and crowding-out-tendencies in the supply chain: The retailers and wholesalers centralised their purchasing departments, optimise the entire supply chain, partly eliminate the intermediary trade and pass on part of the price pressure to the processors and producers. On the other hand, large, specialised, and mechanised producers prevail. Especially between these large producers and the traders, the dependency seems to be partly mutual, so the power is not only on the side of the few retailers and wholesalers. With regard to the working conditions of wage workers in the production, the results show that the perception of working conditions varies depending on the length of employment and living conditions. Working conditions in Swiss agriculture are little regulated by law. All support workers have a negative view of the long working hours of up to  hours per week in winter and up to over  hours per week in summer. The low wages are assessed as good by those who are only temporarily in Switzerland (the wage workers are mainly migrants), and as too low by those who have lived here for years and have a family. Overall, the younger workers who have only been working in vegetable production for a few months rate their work more positively than those who have been working for many years in production. Relations with their supervisors are described as good by all wage workers. The results also show that the scope for improvement of working conditions is very small for the wage workers. Due to price competition and high labour costs, which are an important part of the product price in labour-intensive vegetable production, the producers scope is also limited. The question therefore arises as to what possibilities there might be outside the supply chain to improve the working conditions of the wage workers.","doc_id":22456,"prior":"Produktionsmittel","sdg12":1},{"id":"16","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1498","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Palaearctic grasslands in transition : overarching patterns and future prospects","authors":"Török, Péter; Dengler, Jürgen","subject":"Grassland; Conservation;  Ökologie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"577","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Palaearctic grasslands in transition : overarching patterns and future prospects; Grassland; Conservation;  Ökologie; The Palaearctic biogeographic realm extends over some  million km² and thus more than / of the terrestrial ice-free surface on Earth. It comprises extensive grasslands of different types and origin, which can be subdivided into () natural grasslands with (a) steppes (climatogenic in dry climates), (b) arctic-alpine grasslands (climatogenic in cold climates) and (c) azonal and extrazonal grasslands (pedogenic and topogenic) as well as () secondary grasslands created and sustained by human activities, such as livestock grazing, mowing or burning. Grasslands of the Palaearctic do not only form a major basis for the agriculture of the region and thus its food supply, but are also crucial for other ecosystem services and host a supraproportional part the realm’s plant and animal diversity. To reflect that suitability of grasslands for biodiversity strongly depends on their state, we apply the term High Nature Value (HNV) grassland to those natural grasslands that are not degraded (we call them in good state) and those secondary grasslands that are not intensified (we call them semi-natural). The synthesis at hand introduces seven comprehensive regional chapters organized by the Eurasian Dry Grassland Group (EDGG) on diversity, management and conservation of grasslands of the Palaearctic, covering nearly the complete extent of this realm. After introducing the EDGG as a leading international network dealing with these topics, we take advantage of the information compiled in the regional chapters and the expertise present among their  authors from  different countries to compile for the first time statistics on grassland types and areas as well as rankings of relative importance of factors reducing their biodiversity for the whole Palaearctic biogeographic realm and its major subdivisions (Western and Northern Europe; Eastern Europe; Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East; Russia; Kazakhstan and Middle Asia; China and Mongolia; Japan). We conclude that the current grassland area in the realm is about . million km²of which ca. % are natural (% steppes, % arctic-alpine grasslands, % azonal/extrazonal grasslands) and % secondary. The remaining natural grasslands overall represent about % of their original extent, but only % in Eastern Europe. Among the extant grasslands about / are of High Nature Value, with the highest fraction in the interior of the Eurasian continent and lowest values at its margins, namely Western Europe and Japan. Among the threat factors, abandonment or underuse were most important in general. Only in Russia, Kazakhstan and Middle Asia conversion of grasslands to arable lands was ranked first among the factors, as was eutrophication in Western and Northern Europe. Our area statistics and ranking of threat factors for a complete vegetation formation across the biogeographic realm are important pieces of information both for conservation and basic research – despite all their current limitations. In conclusion, Palaearctic grasslands are in very intense transition; in most regions grassland biodiversity is facing many threats that are strongly linked to changes in human activities. For sustainable use and biodiversity conservation, an integrative view and holistic thinking are inevitable.","doc_id":22459,"prior":"sustainable use","sdg12":1},{"id":"26","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11745","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Environmental impacts and hotspots of food losses : value chain analysis of Swiss food consumption","authors":"Beretta, Claudio; Stucki, Matthias; Hellweg, Stefanie","subject":"Life Cycle Assessment; Ökobilanz; Food Waste;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Produktion","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333, 338","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Environmental impacts and hotspots of food losses : value chain analysis of Swiss food consumption; Life Cycle Assessment; Ökobilanz; Food Waste;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Produktion; Reducing food losses and waste is crucial to making our food system more efficient and sustainable.

In microbes, an important mechanism of HGT is prophage acquisition (phage genomes integrated into bacterial chromosomes). Prophages can influence bacterial fitness via transfer of beneficial genes (including antibiotic-resistance genes, ARGs), protection from superinfecting phages, or switching to a lytic lifecycle which releases free phages infectious to competitors. We expect these effects to depend on environmental conditions because of, for example, environment-dependent induction of the lytic lifecycle. However, it remains unclear how costs/benefits of prophages vary across environments. Here, studying prophages with/without ARGs in Escherichia coli, we disentangled effects of prophages alone and adaptive genes they carry. In competition with prophage-free strains, benefits from prophages and ARGs peaked in different environments. Prophages were most beneficial when induction of the lytic lifecycle was common, whereas ARGs were more beneficial upon antibiotic exposure and with reduced prophage induction. Acquisition of prophage-encoded ARGs by competing strains was most common when prophage induction, and therefore free phages, were common. Thus, selection on prophages and adaptive genes they carry varies independently across environments, which is important for predicting the spread of mobile/integrating genetic elements and their role in evolution.","doc_id":22481,"prior":"lifecycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"76","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19255","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Wohlstands- und Konsumwende im Bereich der Güter des alltäglichen Bedarfs als Teil einer erfolgreichen nachhaltigen Transformation","authors":"Baldissera, Valentino","subject":"Nachhaltigkeit; Transformationsprozess; Konsumwende; Wohlstandswende; Gesellschaftlicher Wandel; Konsum; Wohlstand; Convenience Goods; Konsumgüter; Verbrauchsgüter; Gebrauchsgüter;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"338.927","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Wohlstands- und Konsumwende im Bereich der Güter des alltäglichen Bedarfs als Teil einer erfolgreichen nachhaltigen Transformation; Nachhaltigkeit; Transformationsprozess; Konsumwende; Wohlstandswende; Gesellschaftlicher Wandel; Konsum; Wohlstand; Convenience Goods; Konsumgüter; Verbrauchsgüter; Gebrauchsgüter;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Wohlstand und Konsum sind relevante Themen für das Wohlergehen von Personen, Gesellschaften und Ländern.

So we tried to explain this discrepancy with implicit and explicit attitudes.  participants completed a questionnaire to measure their explicit preferences towards meat. Afterwards the respondents performed the Implicit Association Tests to evaluate their implicit attitudes towards their meat consumption. Because implicit and explicit attitudes do not differ from each other, the results of this study show that the consumer’s statement of reducing meat due to health and ethical concerns is stringent and their intentions are credible. The implicit attitude mediates the relationship between health and ethical concerns and the explicit attitude. Thus, the reduction of the share of meat in the diet is not a temporary fashion, but a crucial customer need.

Whilst the concept of liminality has found increased interest in tourism studies, only few studies have contextualized the airside experience as a liminal one. We investigate the role of food and beverage (F&B) consumption in this context as well as factors influencing F&B outlet patronage intentions. Using a European non-hub commercial airport as practical unit, we applied a mixed methods single case-study methodology to investigate F&B outlet choice in the airside setting. It becomes evident that perceptions of liminality play an important role in this context. Findings support the claim that the airport environment constitutes a special context, an encapsuled or protected space; not only for passengers, but also for employees alike. Whilst airports have a certain uniformity to regular travelers, infrequent travelers perceive air travel as an extraordinary activity, often paired with a certain uncertainty about related procedures. Evidence suggests that passengers’ emotional states play a key role in consumption decisions. Depending on travel purpose and direction, passengers showed differing consumption behaviors.Understanding the airport airside area as a liminoid space and using the concept of boundary work for the transition between home and work realms (and back again) thus serves as a suitable frame of reference to help understand the phenomena that were observed and analyzed in this study. F&B consumption can then be understood to support the mental transition between home and work realms. Our findings thus allow linking the passenger clusters’ different consumption behavior to prevailing emotional states in their transgressions between work and home realm in the liminoid airside context.","doc_id":23043,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3594","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Discovering the relationship lifecycle in FM : phases and drivers of client value perceptions","authors":"Coenen, Christian; Nwanna, Paul","subject":"Relationship lifecycle; Trust; Client; Control;  Facility Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658.2","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Discovering the relationship lifecycle in FM : phases and drivers of client value perceptions; Relationship lifecycle; Trust; Client; Control;  Facility Management; Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify FM client value perceptions as well as the key drivers of this BB relationship.\tDesign/methodology/approach: A literature search on relationship lifecycle and customer value is used to design semi-structured, in-depth group interviews with three large client organizations and their respective FM suppliers.\tFindings: Three key phases of a FM relationship lifecycle are identified and analysed.

With the recent upsurge in petroleum prices coupled with intrinsic volatility of international oil markets, it is fast turning into a politico-socio-economic dilemma for countries like India to sustain future subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and compare the environmental performance of various cooking fuel options, namely LPG (NG), LPG (CO), kerosene, coal, electricity, firewood, crop residue, dung cake, charcoal, and biogas, in the Indian context. The purpose of this study is to find environmentally suitable alternatives to LPG and kerosene for rural and urban areas of the country.Methods: The study assessed the cooking fuel performance on  ReCiPe environmental impact categories using the life cycle assessment methodology. The study modeled the system boundary for each fuel based on the Indian scenario and prepared a detailed life cycle inventory for each cooking fuel taking  GJ of heat energy transferred to cooking pot as the functional unit.Results and discussion: The cooking fuels with the lowest life cycle environmental impacts are biogas followed by LPG, kerosene, and charcoal. The environmental impacts of using LPG are about  to  % lower than kerosene for most environmental impact categories. LPG derived from natural gas has about  to  % lower environmental impact than LPG derived from crude oil. Coal and dung cake have the highest environmental impacts because of significant contributions to climate change and particulate formation, respectively. Charcoal produced from renewable wood supply performs better than kerosene on most impact categories except photochemical oxidation, where its contribution is  times higher than kerosene.Conclusions: Biogas and charcoal can be viewed as potentially sustainable cooking fuel options in the Indian context because of their environmental benefits and other associated co-benefits such as land farming, local employment opportunities, and skill development. The study concluded that kerosene, biogas, and charcoal for rural areas and LPG, kerosene, and biogas for urban areas have the lower environmental footprint among the chosen household cooking fuels in the study.","doc_id":23212,"prior":"life cycle","sdg12":1},{"id":"84","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10446","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Energy supply with micro-CHP for a residential unit with electric vehicle","authors":"Zweifel, Gerhard; Klauz, Sebastian; Struck, Christian; Tillenkamp, Frank; Keller, Tobias; Dorer, Viktor; Weber, Andreas; Gaegauf, Christian; Sattler, Michael","subject":"Building standards; Control strategies;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"620","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Energy supply with micro-CHP for a residential unit with electric vehicle; Building standards; Control strategies;  Ingenieurwesen; In the frame of a research project, the energy production for a residential unit including its mobility by micro-CHP was simulated in detail. Several variations of energetic building standards, of types of energy generation and of energy carriers were investigated. They were compared to reference scenarios in respect of primary energy consumption and environmental impact. For the building use, standard data published in Swiss standards were used. For the mobility, profiles had to be generated based on statistical census data. The results show that micro-CHP systems are coequal to the \"progressive\" scenario based on a heat pump and an electric vehicle in respect of primary energy consumption. Regarding greenhouse gas emissions, they are considerably better than the \"conservative\" scenario based on a gas boiler and a gasoline vehicle, but not quite as good as the \"progressive\" scenario. Micro CHP complement ideally PV in the seasonal distribution, and with an adequate control strategy they can increase massively the consumption on site of the generated electrical energy and therefore decrease the grid load.","doc_id":23277,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"88","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7738","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Trends im Bedürfnisfeld Ernährung : Treiber und Hemmnisse auf dem Weg zu ressourcenleichten Esskulturen","authors":"Baur, Priska; Schluep, Isabelle; Minsch, Jürg","subject":"Trends; Ernährung; Treiber und Hemmnis; Ressourcenleicht; Esskultur; Ressourceneffizienz; Ernährungsverhalten; Bedürfnisfeld Ernährung; Metatrend; Megatrend; Mikrotrend; Gegentrend; Konsumpatriotismus; Globalisierung; Urbanisierung; Digitalisierung; Gender; Soziokultureller Trend; Nischenmarkt; Individualisierung; Ressourcentrend; Personalisierung; Ausser-Haus-Verpflegung; Tierische Nahrungsmittel;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Diätetik","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"300, 613.2","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Trends im Bedürfnisfeld Ernährung : Treiber und Hemmnisse auf dem Weg zu ressourcenleichten Esskulturen; Trends; Ernährung; Treiber und Hemmnis; Ressourcenleicht; Esskultur; Ressourceneffizienz; Ernährungsverhalten; Bedürfnisfeld Ernährung; Metatrend; Megatrend; Mikrotrend; Gegentrend; Konsumpatriotismus; Globalisierung; Urbanisierung; Digitalisierung; Gender; Soziokultureller Trend; Nischenmarkt; Individualisierung; Ressourcentrend; Personalisierung; Ausser-Haus-Verpflegung; Tierische Nahrungsmittel;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Diätetik; Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird diskutiert, welche Trends auf das Bedürfnisfeld Ernährung einwirken, und wie sie die Ressourceneffizienz von Produktion, Verarbeitung und Zubereitung sowie das Ernährungsverhalten der Menschen beeinflussen. Dabei wird unterschieden zwischen sehr langfristigen (Metatrends), langfristigen (Megatrends), mittelfristigen (soziokulturelle und Technotrends) und kurzfristigen Trends (Branchen-, Konsum-, Produkttrends). Trends provozieren Gegentrends. So gibt es zum Megatrend Globalisierung Gegentrends, wofür das Bedürfnisfeld Ernährung zahlreiche Beispiele liefert: In der Politik gewinnen (agrar)protektionistische Ideen zunehmenden Rückhalt, im Recht werden Massnahmen beibehalten oder ausgebaut, die die inländische Land-und Ernährungswirtschaft vor Konkurrenz schützen, in der Wirtschaft wächst die Nachfrage nach «regionalen» Produkten, in der Zivilgesellschaft wachsen die Sympathien für alles, was «aus der Nähe» stammt. Ein genereller Gegentrend zur Globalisierung ist der sogenannte Konsumpatriotismus. Auf der Suche nach relevanten Trends wurden Studien von ausgewählten öffentlichen Organisationen und privaten Unternehmen konsultiert. Zu ersteren gehören die Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung OECD und das World Food System Center WSFC der ETH Zürich; zu letzteren die Forschungs- und Beratungsunternehmen Zukunftsinstitut und Frost & Sullivan sowie das global tätige Nahrungsmittelunternehmen Nestlé Deutschland. Mehrere globale Megatrends werden von allen berücksichtigen Organisationen und Unternehmen explizit oder implizit thematisiert. Dazu zählen der demographische Wandel, Gender, Urbanisierung, natürliche Ressourcen und Umwelt, Infrastrukturen, neue Technologien (v.a. Digitalisierung, Konnektivität), neue Player und Gesundheit. Gleichzeitig fallen auch Unterschiede auf: Während die öffentlich finanzierten und auf die Erkennung von Forschungsbedarf ausgerichteten Organisationen OECD und WSFC eher eine problemorientierte und oftmals auch abstrakte Sprache pflegen, orientieren sich die privaten Unternehmen Frost & Sullivan, das Zukunftsinstitut und Nestlé Deutschland stärker an wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungen, an KonsumentInnen und Unternehmen und deren Bedürfnissen und verwenden eher eine lösungsorientierte Sprache, die nicht zuletzt Marktchancen sichtbar macht.; This paper discusses the trends influencing the field of nutrition and how they affect the resource efficiency of production, processing and preparation, as well as nutritional behaviour. A distinction is made between very long-term (metatrends), long-term (megatrends), medium-term (sociocultural and techno trends) and short-term trends (industry, consumer and product trends). Trends provoke countertrends. Thus, there are numerous countertrends related to the megatrend of globalization, for which the ‘need field’ nutrition provides numerous examples: in politics, (agricultural) protectionist ideas are gaining increasing support; in law, measures are being maintained or expanded to protect the domestic agricultural and food industries from competition; in the economy, demand for ‘regional’ products is growing; in civil society, there is greater sympathy for everything that originates from ‘close by’. A general countertrend to globalization is so-called consumer triotism.In the search for relevant trends, studies from selected public organisations and private companies were consulted. The former includes the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and the World Food System Center WSFC at the ETH Zurich; the latter includes the research and consulting companies Zukunftsinstitut and Frost & Sullivan, as well as the globally active food company Nestlé Germany. Several global megatrends are explicitly or implicitly addressed by all organizations and companies. These include demographic change, gender, urbanisation, natural resources and environment, infrastructures, new technologies (especially digitisation, connectivity), new players, and health. At the same time, differences are also noticeable: while the publicly financed OECD and WSFC organisations, which are geared towards identifying research needs, tend to use problem-oriented and often abstract language, the private companies Frost & Sullivan, the Zukunftsinstitut and Nestlé Germany focus more on economic developments, consumers and companies and their needs, and use solution-oriented language which, not least, makes market opportunities visible. Thirteen megatrends appear to be particularly relevant for the nutritional needs and research questions in the NOVANIMAL project: Connectivity & Digitization, Gender Shift, Globalization, Global Scarcity of Natural Resources, Health, Individualization, Knowledge Culture, Mobility, Neo-Ecology & Smart New Green, New Work, Security, Silver Society & Millennials and Urbanization. In addition to the megatrends, more specific medium and short-term trends are identified, which influence per capita consumption of animal-based food products or the consumption of natural resources for the production, processing and preparation of animal foodstuffs. A distinction was made between resource, socio-cultural, techno and consumer trends and counter-trends.The concluding synopsis discusses relevant drivers and obstacles related to increased resource efficiency and lower per capita consumption of animal-based food products. The considerations lead to the summarizing thesis that the trends that are going in the direction of a ‘resource-light’ diet have a stronger long-term effect. The thesis does not mean that eating cultures which are resource-light will develop on their own and will prevail without resistance. Existing conflicts will become accentuated and new areas of conflict will open up. All affected areas and parties in the field of nutritional needs - in technology, business, politics, education and civil society - are called upon.","doc_id":23281,"prior":"consumption","sdg12":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5470","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Water for extraction : composition, recommendations, and treatment","authors":"Wellinger, Marco; Smrke, Samo; Yeretzian, Chahan","subject":"Water; Water treatment; Alkalinity; Hardness;  Getränketechnologie","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"663","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Water for extraction : composition, recommendations, and treatment; Water; Water treatment; Alkalinity; Hardness;  Getränketechnologie; Water is an essential ingredient for coffee extraction, typically making up more than % of the final beverage.
