Historically, AA patients were thought to be at particularly high risk for HLA alloimmunization.Objective: In the past decades, blood product manufacturing (leukoreduction), but also HLA antibody testing has improved significantly by single antigen bead (SAB) technology. It is currently unknown how those developments have impacted HLA-alloimmunization and treatment outcome in patients with AA.Study design: We retrospectively investigated  AA patients treated by immunosuppressive therapy and/or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation after the introduction of the SAB assay at our center. We compared the HLA antibody results to a historical AA cohort (n=), treated prior to introduction of leukoreduced blood products from  to .Results: HLA alloimmunization was detected in  of  (%) patients in recently treated patient. Past pregnancy, female gender, disease severity, age and a history of more transfusions were significantly associated with a larger number and/or higher intensity (mean fluorescence intensity) of HLA antibodies. Treatment outcome including bleeding episodes, response to treatment, engraftment, GvHD and overall survival was not associated with HLA alloimmunization. In the historical cohort a significantly higher number of HLA antibodies (p<.) with a higher MFI (p<.) was observed.Conclusion: HLA alloimmunization remains frequent in AA tested by current techniques but it has significantly decreased since prior decades and does not affect treatment outcome.","doc_id":119,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"55","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7991","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Technical companies in Switzerland on the way to a corporate culture in line with gender equality","authors":"Ramsauer, Nadja; Manchen Spörri, Sylvia; Weiss Sampietro, Theresia","subject":" Soziale Gruppen;  Leitendes Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"305, 658.4","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Technical companies in Switzerland on the way to a corporate culture in line with gender equality;  Soziale Gruppen;  Leitendes Management","doc_id":332,"prior":"gender equality","sdg5":1},{"id":"43","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9608","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Gender and democratization","authors":"Erny, Matthias","subject":"Gender; Democratization; Gender mainstream;  Soziale Gruppen;  Politik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"305, 320","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Gender and democratization; Gender; Democratization; Gender mainstream;  Soziale Gruppen;  Politik; After World War II, democratization came into fashion as panacea for countries in transition.

The Institute of Midwifery at ZHAW in Winterthur therefore offers a corresponding range of - teaching units in their own skills rooms. Project goal: By getting to know the midwife and her work, children learn that pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period are primarily healthy and natural processes that are handled by the midwife.Methods: The didactic design of the lessons is based on principles of skill-based and age-appropriate teaching such as storyline method, mini-simulations and exploratory learning which are accompanied by realistic and age-appropriate in-house simulation models.Implementation: Within the framework of a pilot project, three teaching lessons are offered to schoolchildren between  to  years of age from the canton of Zurich covering the topics of pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Involved in the project are sixth semester midwifery students from ZHAW who teach selected sequences. The schoolchildren, both girls and boys, who participated in the pilot project showed great interest in the subject. They vigorously participated in conversations about their own birth, contributed to the workshop discussion entitled \"From Conception to Birth\" and became involved in the mini-simulation \"The Birth of a Baby\".Evaluation: All teaching units were evaluated in a multi-step process. Primary class teachers described the lessons as level-appropriate, varied and well-balanced. One of them said: \"It was obvious to me from the beginning that the issue was about natural life cycle processes. I would attend the course again and can absolutely recommend it.\" The midwifery students were proud when they realised how much knowledge they have acquired during their studies and were able to pass on. From the schoolchildren's interest in the course and their questions, the teaching staff concluded that the topics covered during the lessons have a lasting impact on a further discussion of these subjects.Outlook: It is intended to officially include these teaching units in the BSc in Midwifery course syllabus. This also means that sixth semester midwifery students will be playing an active role in the teaching of schoolchildren.","doc_id":552,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22801","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Employing explainable AI to optimize the return target function of a loan portfolio","authors":"Gramespacher, Thomas; Posth, Jan-Alexander","subject":"FinTech; XAI; Credit default; Machine learning;  Spezielle Computerverfahren;  Investition","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"006, 332.6","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Employing explainable AI to optimize the return target function of a loan portfolio; FinTech; XAI; Credit default; Machine learning;  Spezielle Computerverfahren;  Investition; In the recent years, data science methods have been developed considerably and have consequently found their way into many business processes in banking and finance. One example is the review and approval process of credit applications where they are employed with the aim to reduce rare but costly credit defaults in portfolios of loans. But there are challenges. Since defaults are rare events, it is-even with machine learning (ML) techniques-difficult to improve prediction accuracy and improvements are often marginal. Furthermore, while from an event prediction point of view, a non-default is the same as a default, from an economic point of view much more relevant to the end user it is not due to the high asymmetry in cost. Last, there are regulatory constraints when it comes to the adoption of advanced ML, hence the call for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) issued by regulatory bodies like FINMA and BaFin. In our study, we will address these challenges. In particular, based on an exemplary use case, we show how ML methods can be adapted to the specific needs of credit assessment and how, in the case of strongly asymmetric costs of wrong forecasts, it makes sense to optimize not for accuracy but for an economic target function. We showcase this for two simple and ad hoc explainable ML algorithms, finding that in the case of credit approval, surprisingly high rejection rates contribute to maximizing profit.","doc_id":568,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"17","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16470","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Deployment of virtual network functions over multiple WAN interconnected PoPs","authors":"Carapinha, Jorge; Bonnet, Jose; Parreira, Bruno; Silva, Joao; Trajkovska, Irena; Bohnert, Thomas Michael; Xilouris, George; Kourtis, Michail-Alexandros; Sakkas, Christos","subject":" Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Deployment of virtual network functions over multiple WAN interconnected PoPs;  Informatik; Network Functions Virtualization allows Communication Service Providers to extend their traditional service portfolio to new models of service offerings, such as Virtualized Network Functions as a Service (VNFaaS), in which network functions can be traded following the “on-demand” Cloud paradigm.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools and workflow processes are considered key enablers for collaboratively managing such information across phases of the project lifecycle. With the increased adoption of BIM by the construction industry, there are heightened expectations for improved engagement of facility managers (FMs), users and clients in the BIM process. This is based on the proposition that BIM can benefit the operational phase of a building, which contributes the most to the building lifecycle in terms of overall cost, sustainability and usability.Three research questions were investigated: (a) How clients and FMs engagement with the BIM workflow process can be improved through the early contemplation of their requirements; (b) what are the perceptions about BIM and its potential impact on the FM industry from an FM, user and client perspective and (c) what data/information is required by FMs from the BIM workflow process to maximum optimisation of assets in the operation phase.Mixed research methods, including: a literature review of academic and industry publications (e.g. case studies, industry best practice, standards and guidelines), an online survey of FM professionals and focus groups, were used to address the posed research questions.   The findings highlight the need for further education regarding BIM guidelines and standards. In particular, new and more FM/client-focussed BIM strategy documents and templates compared to those currently available are required. Many existing templates (e.g. EIR) are not structured to adequately capture clients’ operational and information needs. Guidance is required on developing BIM strategies which start with clients Organisational Information Requirements (OIR) and Asset Information Requirements (AIR) and guide FMs to prepare an EIR that specifies what, when and how information should be delivered. This will improve timely decision making during design and ensure the right and correctly structured information is delivered in to clients at handover for their Asset Information Model (AIM) to help optimise the operation of their assets.

But how does the prospect of euro area enlargement play out in the countries that have already adopted the euro?

Moreover, little is known about how customers can be motivated to adopt innovations that promote collective benefits. This research investigates the effectiveness of the two most basic elements of incentive-based policies — reward and punishment — with regard to customer participation in the sustainable energy domain. We counter the prevailing assumptions in innovation and technology research that favor the use of reward rather than punishment to engage customers. Based on a series of experimental studies, we find mixed evidence. It appears that punishment is at least as effective as reward in engaging customers in sustainable technology innovations. Even more importantly, both reward and punishment are shown to overcome concerns relating to technology. Moderated mediation reveals that economic incentives and disincentives ameliorate critical obstacles because customers more strongly favor their own personal benefit over the collective benefit and are more willing for ‘self-serving’ reasons to adopt technology that contributes to collective benefits. The findings of this research thus have novel practical and theoretical implications for energy innovation involving customers.","doc_id":1508,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"7","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21008","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Drivers for utilizing pooled-use automated vehicles : empirical insights from Switzerland","authors":"Stoiber, Thomas; Hoerler, Raphael","subject":"Pooled-use autonomous vehicles; Attitudes and values; Drivers for adoption; Exploratory regression analysis;  Verkehr","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"380","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Drivers for utilizing pooled-use automated vehicles : empirical insights from Switzerland; Pooled-use autonomous vehicles; Attitudes and values; Drivers for adoption; Exploratory regression analysis;  Verkehr; ​©  IEEE.

Automated sharing and pooling options instead of private ownership are broadly discussed because of their possible contributions to climate change mitigation and sustainability. Despite the growing amount of literature on the adoption of these alternatives, little empirical evidence is available on the potential drivers of adoption, such as individuals’ socioeconomic background, mobility characteristics, attitudes, and values. To address this gap, we utilize the results of an online choice experiment involving  participants from Switzerland, which tested future mode choices considering automated cars, automated pooled-use taxis, and automated public transport shuttles, both for short- and long-term mobility decisions. Exploratory regression analysis explains the experiment outcome with a broad set of underlying data predicting willingness to use. Our findings illustrate that automated cars and automated public transport often appeal to the user groups of their traditional non-automated counterparts. However, this does not seem to be the case for automated pooled-use taxis, which we find to be associated with higher-income groups. Attributes on current mobility characteristics and values cannot be significantly associated with automated pooled-use taxis. We also demonstrate that short- and long-term mobility decisions are worth studying together in AV adoption studies.","doc_id":1587,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/25019","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Rapid software prototyping from business artifacts","authors":"Wahler, Michael; Conte, Enrico; Frick, Martin; Mosquera, David; Ruiz, Marcela","subject":"SWE; Agile information system engineering; Business agility; Model-driven development;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"005","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Rapid software prototyping from business artifacts; SWE; Agile information system engineering; Business agility; Model-driven development;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; Information systems must be able to quickly adapt to changing requirements. In software development, changing the requirements often entails a repetition of development tasks such as implementation or testing. To accelerate such tasks, model-driven development (MDD) offers users to express their requirements as domain models and to automatically generate code from these models. Most MDD approaches, however, require users to learn new tools and languages. Thus, MDD has found little adoption beyond a few niches and most code is still written by hand, which is slow, costly, and error prone.In this paper, we propose an approach to using existing business artifacts as reusable models in software development. These models can be either transformed into executable code, or they can be used as functional modules using an interpreter. This approach allows product owners to update requirements and build information systems by having the behavior and logic of existing business artifacts immediately reflected in the software, which drastically increases business agility. We validate our approach with a proof of concept for automatically transforming existing business logic and domain data encoded in an Excel document into a web service and generating a web-based user interface for it.","doc_id":1648,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18438","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Preference of birth mode and postnatal health related quality of life after one previous caesarean section in three European countries","authors":"Fobelets, Maaike; Beeckman, Katrien; Buyl, Ronald; Healy, Patricia; Grylka, Susanne; Nicoletti, Jane; Canepa, Matilde; Devane, Declan; Gross, Mechthild Maria; Morano, Sandra; Daly, Deirdre; Begley, Cecily; Putman, Koen","subject":"Midwifery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Quality of life; Vaginal birth after caesarean;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Preference of birth mode and postnatal health related quality of life after one previous caesarean section in three European countries; Midwifery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Quality of life; Vaginal birth after caesarean;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Objectives: Women who have had a caesarean section may have a preference for birth mode during their subsequent pregnancy, either 'vaginal birth after caesarean' (VBAC) or 'elective repeat caesarean section' (ERCS). A mismatch between the preferred and actual birth mode may result in an impaired postnatal Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). This study examined the associations between antenatal birth mode preferences, the actual birth mode and postnatal HRQoL in women with one previous caesarean section in three European countries.Design: Prospective longitudinal survey, as a part of a cluster randomised trial (OptiBIRTH) Setting: Fifteen maternity units in three European countries: Germany (), Ireland () and Italy ().Participants: Women (≥ aged  years) living in Germany, Ireland and Italy with one previous caesarean section. The sample consisted of  women with complete antenatal and postpartum data.Measurements: Women's preference for birth mode after one previous caesarean section was assessed at inclusion to the trial, and HRQoL was assessed antenatally and at three months postpartum using the Short-Form Six-Dimension health survey. Based on women's preferences and actual birth mode six groups were determined: \"match VBAC-VBAC\" (preference for vaginal birth, actual mode of birth vaginal birth), \"match ERCS-ERCS\" (preference for caesarean section, actual mode of birth elective repeat caesarean section), \"match ERCS-EMCS\" (preference for caesarean section, actual mode of birth emergency repeat caesarean section), \"mismatch VBAC-ERCS\" (preference for vaginal birth, actual mode of birth elective repeat caesarean section), \"mismatch VBAC-EMCS\" (preference for vaginal birth, actual mode of birth emergency repeat caesarean section) and \"no preference\". Associations between the preferred and actual birth mode were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses.Findings: Women with preference for vaginal birth but who gave birth by elective repeat caesarean section (mismatch VBAC-ERCS) had a lower postnatal HRQoL compared to women with a preference for vaginal birth who actually had a birth vaginally (match VBAC-VBAC, p = .). Poor antenatal HRQoL scores (p < .) and maternal readmission postpartum (p = .) are cofounding factors for poorer postnatal HRQoL scores.Key Conclusions: The results show that women with a preference for a vaginal birth who gave birth by an elective repeat caesarean section had a significantly lower HRQoL at three months postnatal. The long-term consequences and psychological health of women who do not achieve a vaginal birth after caesarean require further consideration and research.Implications for Practice: Attention should be given to the long-term impact of a mismatch in preferred and actual mode on the psychological health of women","doc_id":1678,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"18","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7526","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Symptoms associated with the DSM IV diagnosis of depression in pregnancy and post partum","authors":"Kammerer, Martin; Marks, Maureen N.; Pinard, Claudia; Taylor, Alyx; Castelberg, Brida von; Künzli, Hansjörg; Glover, Vivette","subject":"Major Depression; Human Females; Psychodiagnosis; Perinatal Period; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; Pregnancy; Postnatal Period; Postpartum Depression; Symptoms;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8, 618","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Symptoms associated with the DSM IV diagnosis of depression in pregnancy and post partum; Major Depression; Human Females; Psychodiagnosis; Perinatal Period; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; Pregnancy; Postnatal Period; Postpartum Depression; Symptoms;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch); Pregnancy and the postpartum may affect symptoms of depression.

Currently, health technology assessment (HTA) tends to be static and a priori: alternatives are compared before launch, and little evaluation occurs after implementation. We suggest a method that builds upon the current pre-launch HTA procedures by conceptualizing a mean-variance approach to the continuous evaluation of attainable portfolios of interventions in health systems. Our framework uses frontier analysis to identify the desirability of available health interventions so decision makers can choose diverse portfolios based upon information about expected returns and risks.

For most governments property is a very important if not the most important class of assets, as they typically provide most of their services in dedicated buildings, such as schools, hospitals, prisons, barracks to name only a few. This gives a genuinely high level of relevancy to the process of recognition and measurement when governments first adopt accrual accounting.Even under International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) there are different processes for first time recognition and measurement allowed. Two main groups can be identified. Firstly, the individual appraisal approach where each and every property is appraised individually and the totals presented in the financial reports are the aggregate of these individual appraisals. Secondly, there is a model approach which looks at historical investments into property in order to estimate current values.Usually the adopting entity uses either one of the two approaches, but not both of them, at least not for the same class of assets. In the State/Canton of Zurich, due to a restructuring of property management in parallel to the adoption of IPSAS, both methods were used on the same portfolio of property. This is a rare setting in which the use of both can be compared in real life situation. A CTI (Swiss commission for technology and innovation) sponsored research project undertakes this comparison. In order to undertake this comparison, criteria for the assessment had to be defined. The comparison starts at a general level with the requirements from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and from the public real estate management. Secondly, the process for the first time recognition, the data requirements for the different methods and the cost related to the two methods are compared. Thirdly, on the qualitative side the adequacy and reliability of the results are considered. Finally, the comparison includes the difference of the two results and its impact on the financial reporting In conclusion, recommendation on the selection of a first time recognition method is derived from the comparison and a general cost benefit consideration. First results show that there are types or categories of property which clearly should be appraised individually, while for others the model approach is equally feasible for financial reporting purposes. However, for financial management resp. real estate management purposes the individual appraisal approach is generally better suited.","doc_id":2705,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14755","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Structured approach to the adaption of information technology governance, risk an compliance in hospitals using design science principles","authors":"Krey, Mike; Furnell, Steven; Harriehausen, Bettina; Knoll, Matthias","subject":"Method; Healthcare; GRC;  Informatik;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004, 362.11","year":"2012","for_data_analysis":"Structured approach to the adaption of information technology governance, risk an compliance in hospitals using design science principles; Method; Healthcare; GRC;  Informatik;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen; Against the background of the current reforms and an aftermath of increasing regulation in the health care sector, hospitals enhance and integrate concepts of IT Governance, Risk and Compliance (IT GRC).

Ten countries participated in the study, reviewing their country’s extended care policy, practice and research using a common matrix. Findings reveal adoption of aspects of extended care in all countries, wide variations in how extended care is conceptualised, legislated, funded and implemented, and very little research on the effectiveness of extended care.

Vielmehr sollten sich Hebammen und Ärzte der Zukunft Zeit für ihre Patientinnen nehmen, ein shared decision making ermöglichen und somit die Patientenautonomie fordern und fördern.","doc_id":3081,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1946","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Mode of birth and postnatal health-related quality of life after one previous cesarean in three European countries","authors":"Fobelets, Maaike; Beeckman, Katrien; Buyl, Ronald; Daly, Déirdre; Sinclair, Marlene; Healy, Patricia; Grylka, Susanne; Nicoletti, Jane; Gross, Mechthild Maria; Morano, Sandra; Putman, Koen","subject":"Obstetric delivery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Quality of life; MeSH; HRQoL;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Mode of birth and postnatal health-related quality of life after one previous cesarean in three European countries; Obstetric delivery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Quality of life; MeSH; HRQoL;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: How a woman gives birth can affect her health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). This study explored HRQoL at  months postpartum in women with a history of one previous cesarean in three European countries.Methods: A prospective longitudinal survey, embedded within a cluster randomized trial in three countries, exploring women's postnatal HRQoL up to  months postpartum. The Short‐Form Six‐Dimensions (SF‐D) was used to measure HRQoL, and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship with mode of birth.Results: Complete data were available from  women. Women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had the highest HRQoL scores, whereas women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .) had the lowest. Postnatal readmission of the mother (P = .), having public health insurance (P = .), and a low antenatal HRQoL score (P < .) contributes to poorer HRQoL scores. More specifically, women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had significantly higher HRQoL scores on the vitality dimension compared with women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .).Conclusions: In women with low‐risk factors, repeat cesareans result in a poorer HRQoL compared with vaginal birth. When there are no contraindications for vaginal birth, women with a history of one previous cesarean should be encouraged to give birth vaginally rather than have an elective repeat cesarean.","doc_id":3365,"prior":"woman","sdg5":1},{"id":"49","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24328","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Using a tailored digital health intervention for family communication and cascade genetic testing in Swiss and Korean families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer : protocol for the DIALOGUE study","authors":"Kim, Sue; Aceti, Monica; Baroutsou, Vasiliki; Bürki, Nicole; Caiata-Zufferey, Maria; Cattaneo, Marco; Chappuis, Pierre O; Ciorba, Florina M; Graffeo-Galbiati, Rossella; Heinzelmann-Schwarz, Viola; Jeong, Joon; Jung, MiSook M; Kim, Sung-Won; Kim, Jisun; Lim, Myong Cheol; Ming, Chang; Monnerat, Christian; Park, Hyung Seok; Park, Sang Hyung; Pedrazzani, Carla A; Rabaglio, Manuela; Ryu, Jai Min; Saccilotto, Ramon; Wieser, Simon; Zürrer-Härdi, Ursina; Katapodi, Maria C","subject":"HBOC; RE-AIM; Cultural and linguistic adaptation; Proportion of informed at-risk relatives;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Using a tailored digital health intervention for family communication and cascade genetic testing in Swiss and Korean families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer : protocol for the DIALOGUE study; HBOC; RE-AIM; Cultural and linguistic adaptation; Proportion of informed at-risk relatives;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Background: In hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), family communication of genetic test results is essential for cascade genetic screening, that is, identifying and testing blood relatives of known mutation carriers to determine whether they also carry the pathogenic variant, and to propose preventive and clinical management options. However, up to % of blood relatives are unaware of relevant genetic information, suggesting that potential benefits of genetic testing are not communicated effectively within family networks. Technology can facilitate communication and genetic education within HBOC families.Objective: The aims of this study are to develop the K-CASCADE (Korean–Cancer Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) cohort in Korea by expanding an infrastructure developed by the CASCADE (Cancer Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) Consortium in Switzerland; develop a digital health intervention to support the communication of cancer predisposition for Swiss and Korean HBOC families, based on linguistic and cultural adaptation of the Family Gene Toolkit; evaluate its efficacy on primary (family communication of genetic results and cascade testing) and secondary (psychological distress, genetic literacy, active coping, and decision making) outcomes; and explore its translatability using the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework.Methods: The digital health intervention will be available in French, German, Italian, Korean, and English and can be accessed via the web, mobile phone, or tablet (ie, device-agnostic). K-CASCADE cohort of Korean HBOC mutation carriers and relatives will be based on the CASCADE infrastructure. Narrative data collected through individual interviews or mini focus groups from  to  HBOC family members per linguistic region and - health care providers involved in genetic services will identify the local cultures and context, and inform the content of the tailored messages. The efficacy of the digital health intervention against a comparison website will be assessed in a randomized trial with  HBOC mutation carriers ( in each study arm). The translatability of the digital health intervention will be assessed using survey data collected from HBOC families and health care providers.Results: Funding was received in October . It is projected that data collection will be completed by January  and results will be published in fall .Conclusions: This study addresses the continuum of translational research, from developing an international research infrastructure and adapting an existing digital health intervention to testing its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial and exploring its translatability using an established framework. Adapting existing interventions, rather than developing new ones, takes advantage of previous valid experiences without duplicating efforts. Culturally sensitive web-based interventions that enhance family communication and understanding of genetic cancer risk are timely. This collaboration creates a research infrastructure between Switzerland and Korea that can be scaled up to cover other hereditary cancer syndromes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT and CRiS KCT; https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): PRR-./","doc_id":3786,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"59","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24031","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"Overcoming cloud concerns with trusted execution environments? : exploring the organizational perception of a novel security technology in regulated Swiss companies","authors":"Geppert, Tim; Anderegg, Jan; Frei, Leoncio; Moeller, Simon; Deml, Stefan; Sturzenegger, David; Ebert, Nico","subject":"Confidential computing; Privacy; Trusted execution environment; SGX;  Allgemeines Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"658","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Overcoming cloud concerns with trusted execution environments? : exploring the organizational perception of a novel security technology in regulated Swiss companies; Confidential computing; Privacy; Trusted execution environment; SGX;  Allgemeines Management; Trusted execution environments are a new approach for isolating data, specific parts of code, or an entire application within untrusted cloud environments.

Breastfeeding and milk analysis of a mother on chronic hemodialysis; Breast Feeding; Creatine; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Milk, Human; Postpartum Period; Potassium; Pregnancy; Renal Dialysis; Sodium; Uric Acid;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Purpose: Women on dialysis rarely become pregnant. However, the overall rate of successful pregnancies is increasing in this patient population and breastfeeding becomes an option for mothers on dialysis. In this study we performed a systematic breast milk composition analysis of a mother on chronic hemodialysis (HD).Methods: Specimens of breast milk and blood were collected in regular intervals before and after HD from a -year old woman starting on day  postpartum. Samples were analyzed for electrolytes, retention solutes, nutrients and other laboratory measurements. Breast milk samples from low-risk mothers matched for postpartum age were used as controls.Results: Significantly higher levels of creatinine and urea were found in pre-HD breast milk when compared to post-HD. A similar post-dialytic decrease was only found for uric acid but not for any other investigated parameter. Conversely, sodium and chloride were significantly increased in post-HD samples. Compared to controls creatinine and urea were significantly higher in pre-HD samples while the difference remained only significant for post-HD creatinine. Phosphate was significantly lower in pre- and post-HD breast milk when compared to controls, whereas calcium showed no significant differences. In terms of nutrient components glucose levels showed a strong trend for a decrease, whereas protein, triglycerides and cholesterol did not differ. Similarly, no significant differences were found in iron, potassium and magnesium content.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on a breastfeeding mother on chronic dialysis. Although we found differences in creatinine, urea, sodium, chloride and phosphate, our general analysis showed high similarity of our patient’s breast milk to samples from low-risk control mothers. Significant variations in breast milk composition between pre- and post-HD samples suggest that breastfeeding might be preferably performed after dialysis treatment. In summary, our findings indicate that breastfeeding can be considered a viable option for newborns of mothers on dialysis.","doc_id":4267,"prior":"woman","sdg5":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2284","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Birth experiences in adult women with a history of childhood sexual abuse","authors":"Leeners, Brigitte; Görres, Gisela; Block, Emina; Hengartner, Michael Pascal","subject":"Childhood sexual abuse; Labor experiences; Dissociation; Trigger; Fear;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems;  Geburt","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616.8, 618.4","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Birth experiences in adult women with a history of childhood sexual abuse; Childhood sexual abuse; Labor experiences; Dissociation; Trigger; Fear;  Neurologie und Krankheiten des Nervensystems;  Geburt; Objective: Although childhood sexual abuse (CSA) may seriously impair childbirth experiences, few systematic evaluations on associations, mediating influences, risk and protective factors are available.

However, few studies included all DSM-IV PDs and even fewer adjusted for other forms of childhood adversity, e.g. bullying or family problems.Method: We analyzed questionnaires completed by  participants of the ZInEP epidemiology survey, a comprehensive psychiatric survey of the general population in Zurich, Switzerland. Associations between childhood adversity and PDs were analyzed bivariately via simple regression analyses and multivariately via multiple path analysis.Results: The bivariate analyses revealed that all PD dimensions were significantly related to various forms of family and school problems as well as child abuse. In contrast, according to the multivariate analysis only school problems and emotional abuse were associated with various PDs. Poverty was uniquely associated with schizotypal PD, conflicts with parents with obsessive-compulsive PD, physical abuse with antisocial PD, and physical neglect with narcissistic PD. Sexual abuse was statistically significantly associated with schizotypal and borderline PD, but corresponding effect sizes were small.Conclusion: Childhood adversity has a serious impact on PDs.

While the serological and ultrasound sections have been updated regularly, the document’s catalogue of pre-existing factors has remained unaltered since . We investigated whether a health-focused revision of the GMR would serve the needs of pregnant women and their care providers.Methods: A revised version of the Mutterpass was developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts, focusing on health and salutogenesis. The new document highlights the uncomplicated pregnancy, and gives pregnant women the opportunity to make their own notes and to choose an appropriate place of birth after consultation with the doctor or midwife. These changes were developed within the requirements of the latest version of the German maternity guidelines (GMG) mandatory during the revision process. To test for user-friendliness and acceptance,  persons –  consultants,  midwives and  pregnant women – were asked to evaluate the revised GMR. Comments could be entered in the GMR itself and in an electronic survey. Notes in the GMR (n= comments) were assigned to one of  categories (e. g. general comments, structural aspects) by  reviewers. After  weeks one of the reviewers repeated her evaluation.Results:  of the  persons approached wrote comments in the document,  participated in the electronic survey.

Future investigations should consider revisions going beyond the content of the mandatory guidelines.Hintergrund: Der deutsche Mutterpass ist das wichtigste Dokument für Schwangere während der Schwangerschaftsbetreuung. Während serologische und Ultraschall-Befunde regelmäßig aktualisiert wurden, blieb der Befundkatalog des Mutterpasses seit  unverändert. Wir untersuchten, ob eine gesundheitsorientierte überarbeitete Version des Mutterpasses den Bedürfnissen von Schwangeren und Betreuenden entspricht.Methode: Ein multidisziplinäres Expertenteam entwickelte eine überarbeitete Version des Mutterpasses, die auf gesundheitsbezogenen Parametern für die Schwangerenbetreuung fokussiert. Das neue Dokument betont die unkomplizierte Schwangerschaft und gibt Schwangeren die Möglichkeit, ihre eigenen Eintragungen zu machen und nach Rücksprache mit dem Arzt oder der Hebamme einen geeigneten Geburtsort zu wählen. Diese Änderungen erfolgten unter Einbeziehung der zu diesem Zeitpunkt aktuellen Mutterschafts-Richtlinie. Um die Anwenderfreundlichkeit und die Akzeptanz zu überprüfen, wurden  Fachärzte,  Hebammen und  Schwangere gebeten, den geänderten Mutterpass zu bewerten. Kommentare waren in dem Mutterpass selbst und in einer elektronischen Umfrage möglich.

To fill this gap, we examine the economic effects of MAAS implementation on Swiss state level, taking into account different types and magnitudes of reforms.Design/methodology/approach: Based on public transition reports, we manually compile a database representing the full sample of all  Swiss cantons. The assessment framework allows us to eliminate time effects giving rise to counterfactual evidence, since transition reports include original and restated values for the same reporting period. We use Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Pearson correlation analysis to draw our main findings.Findings: We find significant economic impact resulting from MAAS implementation, therefore containing decision-relevant information for internal and external stakeholders. Strong impact correlations between economic effects and magnitudes of accounting reforms can be found, with IPSAS having the largest economic consequences. Key finding is, that the implementation of MAAS might lead to a higher valued economic substance with assets increasing more than liabilities. This, in turn, has an direct impact on equity numbers and other key financial indicators.Originality/value: To our best knowledge this is the first paper that investigates the impact of MAAS implementation.

The theoretical fundaments justifying fiscal discipline have been originally developed by public choice scholars like Buchanan (, , ) with his well-known golden rule of public finance or like Tollison and Wagner (), who advocated fiscal/budget rules in order to contain the government size. While most literature focuses on fiscal performance in the presence of fiscal rules (Yerly, ; Alesina, Hausmann, Hommes & Stein, ) or the analysis of different design options (Yerly, ), only few authors consider the accounting dimension and technical aspects despite the fact that fiscal rules (debt breaks) usually build on accrual accounting information (Bergmann, ). Yet, this connection was subject of research concerned with the rise of creative accounting and fiscal gimmickry in the presence of fiscal rules (Von Hagen & Wolff, ; Koen & Van den Noord, ; Milesi-Ferretti, ), which was inspired by political economy literature advocating that politicians and public decision makers have a strong incentive to embellish budget balance (Alesina & Perotti, ). Following this avenue of research, this paper serves the illumination of the connection between debt break mechanisms and the adoption of accrual public sector accounting standards and principles in the interface of political economy in the Swiss context. By explicitly considering the technical accounting dimension, this paper develops an integrated conceptual view on well-established Public Financial Management (PFM) institutions and elaborates how their interdependencies can co-create value with regard to the contemporary challenge of fiscal sustainability. Derivation of this integrated view follows an explorative approach, taking into account expert interviews with director level staff from cantonal finance administrations and policy documents, as well as literature from both research areas – public sector accounting and political economy.","doc_id":4843,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"75","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14513","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Prenatal programming of emotion regulation : neonatal reactivity as a differential susceptibility factor moderating the outcome of prenatal cortisol levels","authors":"Bolten, Margarete; Nast, Irina; Skrundz, Marta; Stadler, Christina; Hellhammer, Dirk H.; Meinlschmidt, Gunther","subject":"Emotion-regulation; HPA axis; Infancy; NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale; Prenatal stress; Reactivity; Temperament; Area under the curve with respect to increase; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Adult; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Emotions; Fetal Development; Pregnant Women;  Psychologie;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"150, 618","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Prenatal programming of emotion regulation : neonatal reactivity as a differential susceptibility factor moderating the outcome of prenatal cortisol levels; Emotion-regulation; HPA axis; Infancy; NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale; Prenatal stress; Reactivity; Temperament; Area under the curve with respect to increase; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Adult; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Emotions; Fetal Development; Pregnant Women;  Psychologie;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Objective: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation during pregnancy is linked to dysfunctional behavioral outcomes in the offspring. According to Belsky's differential susceptibility hypothesis, individuals vary regarding their developmental plasticity. Translating the differential susceptibility hypothesis to the field of fetal programming, we hypothesize that infants' temperament, as the constitutionally based reactivity to stimulation, moderates prenatal environmental effects on postnatal emotion regulation.Methods: Maternal HPA axis activity and stress-reactivity during pregnancy was estimated, by measuring cortisol concentrations in saliva, collected at , ,  and  min after awakening and in blood, collected during a laboratory stress test (Trier Social Stress Test), respectively. Newborns reactivity to stimulation was evaluated between postnatal day  and  using the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale. Infant's self-quieting-activities, as an indicator of emotion regulation, were evaluated at the age of six months during the still face paradigm.Results: Maternal cortisol reactivity to stress during pregnancy was associated with infant's emotion regulation at the age of six months. Whereas cortisol levels after awakening in mid and late pregnancy were not associated with emotion regulation. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed that in interaction with neonatal reactivity, both, prenatal maternal HPA activity as well as prenatal maternal HPA reactivity to stress predicted emotion regulation.Conclusion: The findings indicate that newborns' reactivity to stimulation is moderating the association between prenatal exposure to maternal glucocorticoids and emotion regulation in infancy. Data suggests that temperamental characteristics of the newborn are a relevant differential susceptibility factor with regard to prenatal effects on emotion regulation.","doc_id":4944,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"77","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12010","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Master of Advanced Studies in Midwifery Skills plus","authors":"Hauser, Regula","subject":"Weiterbildung;  Hochschulbildung;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"378, 618","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Master of Advanced Studies in Midwifery Skills plus; Weiterbildung;  Hochschulbildung;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: The demands on the skills and knowledge of midwives in a practical environment become greater as they become more complex. Moreover the Swiss healthcare system is undergoing major changes and the areas of work of midwives are changing too. Midwives must possess advanced professional and academic skills. Clinics require midwives who can apply advanced knowledge and are able to implement it in everyday practice as well as guide, accompany and advise colleagues. Self-employed midwives need evidence-based knowledge to provide expert care to women and their families. Midwives with advanced skills contribute significantly to securing and improving the quality of care for women and their families, and also take on new roles in an inter-professional context.Aim: To develop a continuing education programme for midwives at the University of Applied Sciences which concludes with a MAS. The focus is on specialised knowledge which is scientifically based and directly related to the practical activity of a midwife.Structure: The MAS in Midwifery Skills plus consists of  modules and a master thesis. The modular design of the MAS allows individual planning of this part-time continuing education programme.

For most women a vaginal birth after a previous CS (VBAC) is a safe option. However, the rate of VBAC differs in an international perspective. Obtaining deeper knowledge of clinicians’ views on VBAC can help in understanding the factors of importance for increasing VBAC rates. Focus group interviews with clinicians and women in three countries with high VBAC rates (Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands) and three countries with low VBAC rates (Ireland, Italy and Germany) are part of “OptiBIRTH”, an ongoing research project. The study reported here aims to explore the views of clinicians from countries with low VBAC rates on factors of importance for improving VBAC rates.Methods: Focus group interviews were held in Ireland, Italy and Germany. In total  clinicians participated in nine focus group interviews. Five central questions about VBAC were used and interviews were analysed using content analysis. The analysis was performed in each country in the native language and then translated into English. All data were then analysed together and final categories were validated in each country.Results: The findings are presented in four main categories with several sub-categories: ) “prameters for VBAC”, including the importance of the obstetric history, present obstetric factors, a positive attitude among those who are centrally involved, early follow-up after CS and antenatal classes; ) “organisational support and resources for women undergoing a VBAC”, meaning a successful VBAC requires clinical expertise and resources during labour; ) “fear as a key inhibitor of successful VBAC”, including understanding women’s fear of childbirth, clinicians’ fear of VBAC and the ways that clinicians’ fear can be transferred to women; and ) “shared decision making – rapport, knowledge and confidence”, meaning ensuring consistent, realistic and unbiased information and developing trust within the clinician-woman relationship.Conclusions: The findings indicate that increasing the VBAC rate depends on organisational factors, the care offered during pregnancy and childbirth, the decision-making process and the strategies employed to reduce fear in all involved.","doc_id":5343,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"40","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17337","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Which outcome domains are important in palliative care and when? : an international expert consensus workshop, using the nominal group technique","authors":"de Wolf-Linder, Susanne; Dawkins, Marsha; Wicks, Francesca; Pask, Sophie; Eagar, Kathy; Evans, Catherine J; Higginson, Irene J; Murtagh, Fliss E M","subject":"Palliative care; Quality indicator; Patient outcome assessment; Patient reported outcome measure; Consensus;  Pflege","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"610.73","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Which outcome domains are important in palliative care and when? : an international expert consensus workshop, using the nominal group technique; Palliative care; Quality indicator; Patient outcome assessment; Patient reported outcome measure; Consensus;  Pflege; Background: When capturing patient-level outcomes in palliative care, it is essential to identify which outcome domains are most important and focus efforts to capture these, in order to improve quality of care and minimise collection burden.Aim: To determine which domains of palliative care are most important for measurement of outcomes, and the optimal time period over which these should be measured.Design: An international expert consensus workshop using nominal group technique.

Energy efficiency means providing the same benefit (output) with less energy input. This can be achieved by adoption of existing, more efficient technologies and energy system solutions or by an optimized matching of energy supply and demand. To foster application of these technologies and behaviours in households, administrations and companies, it requires incentives such as taxes, grants or on-site advice by experts. The initiators of such energy efficiency programmes are diverse: national or regional administrations or institutions, but also energy service companies (ESCO) or financial service companies.How do these programmes work, who is addressed by whom and what are innovative models of such programs? Our desk research about energy efficiency programs in selected OECD-countries analyses target groups, governance mechanisms, factors of success and shows innovative programmes of the different initiators mentioned above.Working together with other institutions for the setup and operation of an energy efficiency programme is important. According to our findings, this could be done better, especially from the national initiator’s side. Architects and construction companies are rarely appealed by any of the initiators and facility owners and maintenance staff only by ESCOs.

The skills that multinational corporations (MNCs) value and relied upon have been evolving faster than ever. Hence, learning and development (L&D) has been finding new ways to help their workforce keep up with the shifting skills needs. However, there have been numerous issues with traditional training for skills development, including considerable financial and time investments that may interfere with a company's daily operations. As a result, an increasing trend toward technology-enabled learning, such as microlearning, has aided MNCs in quickly filling skill gaps. The aim of this thesis was to shed light on the emerging topic of microlearning in hopes of paving the way for future research. With many L&D professionals still unfamiliar with the present state of microlearning, they would have been even far less aware of the factors to implement it successfully within their organizations. This research also took on the strategic lens in examining the role of strategic human resource management (SHRM) and organizational learning (OL) through the perspective of L&D professionals. Four research objectives have also been of particular interest throughout this thesis. In order to fulfill the research question and stated objectives, this research adopted a qualitative research design of an exploratory nature. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six L&D professionals. There were two categories of L&D experts interviewed: those with strategic level experience and those with systems or operational level expertise. The results showed that L&D professionals agreed that SHRM and OL serve as a sources of competitive advantage. The conducted research also revealed that OL is not only a competitive advantage, but also a survival strategy, as it aids the firm in adapting to its ever-changing business environment. The findings also indicated that L&D is seen as a strategic enabler. The results gathered that the most critical skills gap is the need to enable employees to take care of their continuous self-development. By combining the information from the literature review with the findings from the interviews, five main drivers for the adoption of microlearning emerged. Likewise, this thesis also presented five main features that distinguish microlearning as an effective training approach for skills development. Taking into account the study's limitations, the findings led to recommendations for L&D professionals on nine multi-dimensional success factors for the implementation of microlearning. While L&D has a crucial role to play in the success of an organization’s training strategy and approach, it also demands significant buy-in and participation from top management, line management, and every single employee. Ultimately, every single learner should be responsible for his or her continuous self-development in order for the organization to gain a competitive advantage through its human capital.","doc_id":5644,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"55","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21904","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Towards assessing the resource criticality of agricultural livelihood systems","authors":"Meylan, Grégoire; Thiombiano, Boundia Alexandre; Le, Quang Bao","subject":"Agricultural livelihood system; Criticality assessment; Material flow analysis; Solution-oriented indicator; Sustainable intensification; Systemic approach;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Towards assessing the resource criticality of agricultural livelihood systems; Agricultural livelihood system; Criticality assessment; Material flow analysis; Solution-oriented indicator; Sustainable intensification; Systemic approach;  Landwirtschaft; Despite the many advantages of sustainable intensification (SI), the level of adoption of SI practices in African smallholding farms is still very low, highlighting the need for adequate methods for monitoring farm sustainability. Research on SI and related poverty alleviation strategies focus either on the “problems” or on the “solutions” for agricultural livelihood systems (ALS) with separate sets of indicators developed accordingly. Bridging the two approaches, we propose an indicator set to assess the criticality of a resource to ALSs in order to support smallholders, decision-makers, and practitioners in the process of SI. The set indicates what problems an ALS faces in the form of resource supply risks and the ALS’s ability to successfully cope with such problems, i.e., how resilient it is to these supply risks. We apply the ALS criticality approach (ALSCA) to macronutrients in three different ALS types in the village cluster of Pontieba, Ioba Province, Burkina Faso. Two criticality indicators are highlighted. First, the three ALS types are not facing equal nitrogen supply risks, when the latter is informed by depletion time. The depletion time indicates the time until which a resource stock is depleted at the current mining rate. The average depletion time of soil nitrogen stocks ranges from some  to  years. Second, the reliance on own resources is an indicator measuring resilience to supply restriction. In Pontieba, regardless of macronutrient, reliance on own nutrients never surpasses % when ALS averages are considered. The study showed that the ALSCA can contribute to the implementation of SI practices through support at four levels: ) providing a holistic view on the ALS to avoid problem-shifting and enable prioritization, ) providing options to reduce resource criticality, ) mutual learning between ALSCA practitioners and smallholder farmers through knowledge integration, and ) facilitating policy coherence from local to national levels thanks to the ALSCA’s applicability on different scales.","doc_id":5684,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"69","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/16123","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Perinatal mental disorders in Switzerland : prevalence estimates and use of mental-health services","authors":"Berger, Anke; Bachmann, Nicole; Signorell, Andri; Erdin, Rebekka; Oelhafen, Stephan; Reich, Oliver; Cignacco, Eva","subject":"Health care cost; Insurance claim review; Mental disorder; Mental health service; Midwifery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Referral and consultation; Postpartum period;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Perinatal mental disorders in Switzerland : prevalence estimates and use of mental-health services; Health care cost; Insurance claim review; Mental disorder; Mental health service; Midwifery; Perinatal care; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Referral and consultation; Postpartum period;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: Perinatal mental disorders (PMDs) are the most common complication of pregnancy and the first postpartum year. Since PMD prevalence and use of mental-health services by perinatal women in Switzerland are unknown, we analysed existing health statistics.Methods: We used statistics from a large health insurance company, hospitals and freelance midwives. We assessed the annual rates of mental healthcare use in perinatal women (n =  ). We ascertained the annual rates of PMD treatment in obstetric inpatients (n =  ), and annual rates of PMD records by freelance midwives (n =  ). In   women who gave birth in  or , we assessed use of mental-healthcare before and during pregnancy, and in the postpartum year.

Women with PMD use mental health services mainly in non-obstetric outpatient settings. Medication was the most frequent treatment. Primary care providers and mental health specialists contributed almost equally to consultation treatments. PMD during pregnancy raised overall costs of healthcare in the postpartum year by  Swiss francs.Conclusions: Health-system research and perinatal healthcare should take into consideration the high prevalence of PMD.

We report internal consistency reliability, corrected-item-to-total correlations, factor loadings and convergent and discriminant validity of the new scale.Results: The Childbirth Fear – Prior to Pregnancy (CFPP) scale showed high internal consistency across samples (α > .). All corrected-item-to total correlations exceeded ., supporting the uni-dimensionality of the scale. Construct validity of the CFPP was supported by a high correlation between the new scale and a two-item visual analogue scale that measures fear of birth (r > . across samples). Weak correlations of the CFPP with scores on measures that assess related psychological states (anxiety, depression and stress) support the discriminant validity of the scale.","doc_id":6043,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"7","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22564","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Deutungen häuslicher Gewalt von Betroffenen im Kontext normativer Bilder und gesellschaftlicher Erwartungshaltungen","authors":"Nef, Susanne","subject":"Gewalt in Paarbeziehungen; Soziales Problem; Verstehende Gewaltforschung; Soziales Ungleichheitsverhältnis; Soziale Prozesse der Differenzierung und Hiearchisierung;  Soziale Interaktion;  Familiensoziologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"302, 306.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Deutungen häuslicher Gewalt von Betroffenen im Kontext normativer Bilder und gesellschaftlicher Erwartungshaltungen; Interpretations of domestic violence by people who experienced violence in the context of normative images and societal expectations; Gewalt in Paarbeziehungen; Soziales Problem; Verstehende Gewaltforschung; Soziales Ungleichheitsverhältnis; Soziale Prozesse der Differenzierung und Hiearchisierung;  Soziale Interaktion;  Familiensoziologie; Im öffentlichen Diskurs, sozialpädagogischer Praxis und Gewaltforschung lässt sich feststellen, dass häufig von einer Essenz des Phänomens „Gewalt“ ausgegangen wird. Auch in der empirischen Forschung zu Gewalt in Paarbeziehungen wird zumeist a priori gesetzt, was darunter gefasst wird. Wie Betroffene das Erlebte selbst deuten, steht hingegen nur sehr selten im Fokus. Basierendauf einer qualitativen Studie wird daher der Frage nachgegangen, wie Personen, die häusliche Gewalt in Paarbeziehungen erfahren haben, die Gewalt und ihre Gewalterfahrungen deuten und wie diese Deutungen sozial hergestellt werden. Anhand einer theoretischen Modellierung wird aufgezeigt, dass Gewalt in Beziehungen nicht auf situative Dynamiken reduziert werden kann und nicht nur Gegenstand (körperlicher) Erfahrung ist, sondern im Zentrum von intersubjektiven Deutungs- und Aushandlungsprozessen steht, die sich u.a. an normativen Bildern und gesellschaftlichen Erwartungen orientieren. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird mit Blick auf die sozialpädagogische Forschungspraxis für den Zugang der verstehenden Gewaltforschung argumentiert.; In public discourses, social work practice and research on violence, itis often assumed that there is an essence of the phenomenon of violence. In empirical research on violence in couple relationships, too, the definition of what is meant by violence is usually given a priori. How survivors of violence Interpret their experiences themselves, however, is hardly ever the focus of attention. Based on a qualitative study, the article addresses the question of how people who haveexperienced violence in couple relationships interpret violence and their experiencesof violence and how these interpretations are socially produced. Theoretical modelling of these process shows that violence in relationships cannot be reduced tosituational dynamics and is not merely an object of (physical) experience, but that israther at the centre of intersubjective processes of interpretation and negotiation thatare framed by normative images and societal expectations. Against this background,it will be argued that the approach of understanding violence research can sensitize social work research and practice.","doc_id":6292,"prior":"domestic violence","sdg5":1},{"id":"15","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19879","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Comparison of standardized sampling and measurement reference systems for aircraft engine non-volatile particulate matter emissions","authors":"Lobo, Prem; Durdina, Lukas; Brem, Benjamin T.; Crayford, Andrew P.; Johnson, Mark P.; Smallwood, Greg J.; Siegerist, Frithjof; Williams, Paul I.; Black, Elizabeth A.; Llamedo, Andrea; Thomson, Kevin A.; Trueblood, Max B.; Yu, Zhenhong; Hagen, Donald E.; Whitefield, Philip D.; Miake-Lye, Richard C.; Rindlisbacher, Theo","subject":"Luftfahrt; Emission; Aerosol; Flugzeugtriebwerk; Luftqualität;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"620","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Comparison of standardized sampling and measurement reference systems for aircraft engine non-volatile particulate matter emissions; Luftfahrt; Emission; Aerosol; Flugzeugtriebwerk; Luftqualität;  Ingenieurwesen; The International Civil Aviation Organization has established new regulatory standards for emissions certification of non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) from aircraft turbine engines. The adoption of the nvPM emissions regulatory standards required development of a standardized sampling and measurement methodology, and rigorous testing. Three reference systems for aircraft engine nvPM emissions measurement, compliant with the specifications for the standardized methodology, were independently developed. This paper reports the results of the first inter-comparison of these three reference systems using a CFM-B/ aircraft engine to establish repeatability and intermediate precision of the sampling and measurement systems as part of the multi-agency international collaborative projects: Aviation-Particle Regulatory Instrumentation Demonstration Experiment (A-PRIDE) /Studying, sAmpling and Measuring of aircraft ParticuLate Emissions (SAMPLE) III - SC. The instruments used in the three reference systems recorded nvPM mass and number concentration, which were converted to their respective emission indices for comparison. The reference systems generally agreed to within % of the average nvPM number emission index and % of the average nvPM mass emission index. The only exception was for the nvPM mass instruments, which exhibited a higher variation as the concentration levels approached the limit of detection. The additional measured particle size distributions could be approximated to lognormal distributions with the geometric mean diameter ranging from  nm to  nm, and the geometric standard deviation varying between . and ..

The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy.A Swiss cohort of  women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression .%, atypical depression .% and non specified depression .%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research.","doc_id":6309,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24628","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"The normative framework of intimate partner violence : mechanisms of differentiation from others","authors":"Nef, Susanne","subject":"Intimate partner violence; Domestic violence;  Familiensoziologie;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"306.8, 362","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"The normative framework of intimate partner violence : mechanisms of differentiation from others; Intimate partner violence; Domestic violence;  Familiensoziologie;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","doc_id":6346,"prior":"partner violence","sdg5":1},{"id":"53","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22881","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Sun oxygen system : oxygen supply in fish breeding ponds","authors":"Jonathan, Konrad","subject":"Sun Oxygen System; SOS; Dissolved oxygen; DO; Tilapia; Smiling Gecko;  Aquakultur","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"639.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Sun oxygen system : oxygen supply in fish breeding ponds; Sun Oxygen System; SOS; Dissolved oxygen; DO; Tilapia; Smiling Gecko;  Aquakultur; Fish from aquaculture is becoming increasingly important for global food security. For the Cambodian population, fish is the most important source of animal protein. In , the NGO Smiling Gecko Cambodia was founded. Through cooperation with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, the Smiling Gecko Fish Project was launched  years later. In order to promote the education and income of surrounding smallholder women farmers and to counteract gender inequality, the Woman in Aquaculture project was launched. The Sun Oxygen System (SOS) was developed by the ZHAW to enable the planned fish breeding ponds to be aerated independently of the electricity grid. A pump powered by a solar panel transports the surface water, which is supersaturated with oxygen through photosynthesis by algae, into deeper layers. In this way, the excess oxygen does not immediately diffuse into the ambient air but can be stored for longer by the entire water column. For this work, a feeding trial with Nile tilapias was conducted in two fish ponds (water volume  m) to validate the benefits of the SOS. One pond was operated with an SOS, the other without. Besides daily measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, water quality parameters were analysed and SOS performance was monitored. Due to excessive oxygen consumption at night and a clogged SOS pump, the trial was split into two trials. Trial A was started with a fish density of . kg/m (. kg/m). Trial B was continued with a fish density of . kg/m (. kg/m). The daily DO concentrations of the two ponds recorded during Trial B showed a . kg higher oxygen input during the day in the pond with SOS. However, this increased oxygen input was used up again overnight, so that the morning DO concentration with SOS was always lower from the th day (Trial B) of the trial than without SOS, and from the th day (Trial B) onwards no longer rose above  mg/l. Weighing the fish did not yield any useful data, as the feeding trial was stopped early in both trials due to the DO concentration being too low. The sample size of the weighed fish in both trials was considered too small to calculate a representative average weight, as the scatter of the weights was too large. Daily DO concentration curves were used to show the effect of SOS on pond water mixing. While without SOS a stratification with different DO concentrations takes place, with SOS the DO concentration is balanced in the evening. An analysis of the SOS performance showed that on sunny days a power surplus of . kWh is produced, which can be used for additional energy consumers. The reasons for the high oxygen consumption overnight were then discussed. Possible solutions were identified and design changes were proposed for further SOS tests.","doc_id":6432,"prior":"gender inequality","sdg5":1},{"id":"89","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8089","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A balancing act in an unknown territory : a metasynthesis of first-time mothers׳ experiences in early labour","authors":"Eri, Tine S.; Bondas, Terese; Gross, Mechthild Maria; Janssen, Patricia; Green, Josephine M.","subject":"Early labour; Midwives; Metasynthesis; Women׳s experiences;  Geburt","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618.4","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"A balancing act in an unknown territory : a metasynthesis of first-time mothers׳ experiences in early labour; Early labour; Midwives; Metasynthesis; Women׳s experiences;  Geburt; Objective: To integrate findings of individual studies in order to broaden the understanding of first-time mothers’ experiences of early labour.Design: The methodology was metasynthesis which is based on the interpretive meta-ethnography described by Noblit and Hare (). Metasynthesis is research on research which synthesises the findings of previous qualitative studies, and the focus is on interpretation and the creation of new knowledge.Setting: All included studies originated from high resource countries (USA , UK , and Scandinavia ) and all were carried out in a context of hospital based maternity care.Participants: A total of  women participated in the studies.Findings:  articles were included. The main results are presented with the metaphor a balancing act in an unknown territory. The “unknown territory” has a double meaning: as the personal experience of going into labour for the first time and as encountering the maternity care system. On both levels women have to make significant decisions: whether labour really has started and subsequently when to go to the hospital. A key challenge is to balance the arrival on the labour ward at the ‘right’ time, not too early and not too late. Arriving at the ‘right’ time leads to a positive path, while arriving “too soon” might lead to a cascade of negative experiences. The results are further presented with five central themes: ‘Finding out if labour has started is absorbing’; ‘Dealing with labour at home’; “Trying to arrive at the labour ward at the right time”; “There is always a risk of being sent home”; “encountering health professionals arouses strong emotions”.Conclusions: The metasynthesis broadens the understanding of first-time mothers’ experiences of early labour, and suggests that women’s needs when planning a hospital birth are not being adequately met at this stage in the labour process. Three areas of future research are suggested: how to support and strengthen women during pregnancy in order to cope with early labour; women’s experiences of early labour when planning a birth in contexts other than hospital; and to continue to investigate new ways of giving care during early labour.","doc_id":6467,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"59","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17593","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Critical age windows in the impact of lifetime smoking exposure on respiratory symptoms and disease among ever smokers","authors":"Erbas, Bircan; Knudsen, Toril Mørkve; Janson, Christer; Nilsen, Roy M.; Accordini, Simone; Benediktdottir, Bryndis; Dratva, Julia; Heinrich, Joachim; Jarvis, Debbie; Leynaert, Benedcite; Matheson, Melanie C.; Norbäck, Dan; Real, Francisco G.; Raherison-Semjen, Chantal; Villani, Simona; Dharmage, S.C.; Svanes, C.","subject":"Asthma; Cigarette smoking; ECRHS; Lung function; Respiratory symptom;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Critical age windows in the impact of lifetime smoking exposure on respiratory symptoms and disease among ever smokers; Asthma; Cigarette smoking; ECRHS; Lung function; Respiratory symptom;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Background: Despite extensive knowledge of smoking effects on respiratory disease, there is no study including all age windows of exposure among ever smokers.

The nurses attend these studies alongside employment which are based on a modular system with eight presence days per module (DAS =  modules). Due to the actual COVID- situation and the nurses’ shortage in clinics, classroom teaching was no longer possible.MethodsAs a consequence and due to future learning trends, we generated the “breast care module” as a blended (face-to-face and virtual) module starting with a detailed content and target audience analysis. We illustrated the whole blended-learning course in a “scripting tool” with expert experiences included.ResultsThe didactic methodology was adjusted by intensifying self-directed learning using Moodle, an online learning management system using Webinars, Wiki, peer-feedback, lessons-learned. The AVIVA methodology was utilised for the online course as well as for in-person classes. On the content aspect, new topics like pregnancy and breast cancer, genetic counselling, plastic surgery methods, follow-up care and survivorship were included.ConclusionsThis course is conducive to learning as it provides a deeper insight in specific topics and allows for independent learning at a time, that is most convenient for the participants.

For future diffusion of photovoltaics, understanding these social influences on the decision to adopt is key. Several studies have used revealed preference approaches to discern peer effects in PV adoption, proving their existence but leaving open questions about underlying psychological mechanisms. We close this gap by conducting a survey among potential PV adopters in one of the top three fastest-growing European solar markets and find that two types of social norms, descriptive and injunctive norms and their underlying interplay, play an important role in explaining PV adoption decision and diffusion patterns. Our findings have significant policy implications – as an alternative to following the shotgun approach of uniform nationwide incentives, policymakers should consider inducing snowball effects by facilitating the creation of regional hot spots. Such programs, which may be supported through co-investments between federal and local authorities, would effectively complement existing policy approaches.","doc_id":7866,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"68","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15241","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"FM awareness of building information modelling (BIM) : August 2017","authors":"Ashworth, Simon; Tucker, Matthew","subject":"Facility management; Building information modelling;  Facility Management;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"658.2, 690","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"FM awareness of building information modelling (BIM) : August ; Facility management; Building information modelling;  Facility Management;  Hausbau und Bauhandwerk; The adoption and use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the whole life process of designing, creating and operating buildings, assets and infrastructure projects is a worldwide growing trend. The research findings presented here aim to establish a benchmark of the current perception and awareness of BIM by facilities management professionals.BIM and other digital trends such as big data and sensors have potential wide-reaching implications for many industries including facilities management (FM). In April  BIM became mandatory for UK government procurement projects in line with the Government Construction Strategy (). Its adoption and use was seen as a critical step to help achieve the ambitious cost, sustainability and trade targets set out in the Construction  strategy (); - % reduction in the initial cost of construction and the whole life cost of built assets-  % reduction in the overall time, from inception to completion, for newbuild and refurbished assets-  % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the built environment- % reduction in the trade gap between total exports and total imports for construction products and materialsThe Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industries have already started to adopt BIM as the new norm for procuring, designing and creating assets. There have been regular surveys in these sectors by NBS and other professional organisations regarding the awareness and development of BIM. However, to date the level of awareness and perception of BIM from a FM professional’s perspective has not received the same level of attention. This presents a critical gap in research as clients and FM professionals are key to the start of the BIM process in terms of defining the OIR, AIR and EIR. It is essential that academia works closely together with professional organisations such as BIFM to help FM professionals in practice and to better understand how BIM might affect and help the FM industry. This has never been more important as the role of FM in the BIM process is increasingly recognised as critical to realising the much talked about potential benefits of BIM.Awareness of BIM is growing across the industry, but there are disparities in the level of sophistication, maturity and application of BIM in FM across specific organisations, sectors, industries, and countries. The growing importance of appropriate standards, professional guidance and academic research to bridge such gaps have never been more important. There is a growing body of international academic literature and industry reports pointing to the importance, and criticality of the involvement and integration of FM in the early design phase. In order to ensure the FM industry is well prepared for engaging with other key stakeholders in BIM projects it is essential that the level of awareness of BIM and how facilities management professionals seeBIM impacting on the FM industry are well understood. The results of the recent ‘FM awareness of BIM’ survey jointly undertaken between Liverpool John Moores University, the Zurich University of Applied Sciences and BIFM are published here to better inform industry. The aim is to help us understand how we can develop further BIM guidance material for BIFM members. Some guides have already been developed and published on the knowledge section of the BIFM website. These include the ‘operational readiness’ (BIFM ) of FM to implement BIM, the ‘employer’s information requirements (EIR): template and guidance’ (BIFM ), and ‘the role of FM in BIM projects’ good practice guide (BIFM ).","doc_id":8149,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"49","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19825","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Changing behaviour in pregnant women : a scoping review","authors":"Zinsser, Laura A.; Stoll, Kathrin; Wieber, Frank; Pehlke-Milde, Jessica; Gross, Mechthild Maria","subject":"Pregnancy; Behaviour change wheel; Empowerment; Health promotion; Midwifery; Intervention;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Changing behaviour in pregnant women : a scoping review; Pregnancy; Behaviour change wheel; Empowerment; Health promotion; Midwifery; Intervention;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Objectives: Behaviour change programmes (BCPs) for pregnant women are frequently implemented as part of health promotion initiatives.

The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) only recognizes cultures as ‘type material’, thereby preventing the naming of uncultivated organisms. In this Consensus Statement, we propose two potential paths to solve this nomenclatural conundrum. One option is the adoption of previously proposed modifications to the ICNP to recognize DNA sequences as acceptable type material; the other option creates a nomenclatural code for uncultivated Archaea and Bacteria that could eventually be merged with the ICNP in the future. Regardless of the path taken, we believe that action is needed now within the scientific community to develop consistent rules for nomenclature of uncultivated taxa in order to provide clarity and stability, and to effectively communicate microbial diversity.","doc_id":8830,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21426","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"First assessed cervical dilatation: is it associated with oxytocin augmentation during labour? : a retrospective cohort study in a university hospital in Switzerland","authors":"Schick, Céline; Spineli, Loukia M; Raio, Luigi; Gross, Mechthild M.","subject":"Admission; Cervical dilatation; Epidural analgesia; Labour dystocia; Midwifery care; Oxytocin augmentation;  Geburt","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618.4","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"First assessed cervical dilatation: is it associated with oxytocin augmentation during labour? : a retrospective cohort study in a university hospital in Switzerland; Admission; Cervical dilatation; Epidural analgesia; Labour dystocia; Midwifery care; Oxytocin augmentation;  Geburt; ObjectivesThe primary objective of this study was to examine the association between the first assessed cervical dilatation in a labourward and the use of oxytocin augmentation during labour. Further analysis was performed by examining the actual stage of labour at the point oxytocin was first administered to those women.DesignRetrospective cohort study with the data collected from the medical records of the hospital.SettingUniversity Hospital Bern, SwitzerlandParticipants term nulliparous and multiparous women with a singleton pregnancy giving birth during the period June  and May , representing Robson groups  and .Measurements and findingsDescriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were performed. It was found that for the entire process of labour, nulliparous and multiparous women (n = ) with a first cervical dilatation of  or more cm were less likely to be augmented with oxytocin (OR ., % CI .; . and OR ., % CI .; ., respectively) compared to women with a first cervical dilatation of less than  cm. Out of these augmented women (n = ) having a first cervical dilatation of  or more cm, they had a lower likelihood of being augmented during the first stage of labour compared to women with a first cervical dilatation of less than  cm (OR ., % CI .; . for nulliparae and OR ., % CI .; . for multiparae). Additionally, it was observed that other factors contributed to the application of oxytocin. One such example was that epidural analgesia was associated with a high risk of oxytocin augmentation in nulliparae (OR ., % CI .; .) and multiparae (OR ., % CI .; .). The application of oxytocin was also found to affect the caesarean section rate in nulliparous and multiparous women as it was % and % respectively for those with oxytocin versus % and % respectively for those without oxytocin.Key conclusionsEarly admission to the labourward is associated with an increased use of oxytocin to augment labour, particularly, during the first stage of labour. Epidural analgesia is a main predictor for oxytocin augmentation in nulliparous and multiparous women.Implications for practicePregnant women warrant more appropriate support during early labour, avoiding early maternal exhaustion and excessive obstetrical interventions.","doc_id":9065,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23014","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Agile software development : practices, self-organization, and satisfaction","authors":"Biddle, Robert; Kropp, Martin; Meier, Andreas; Anslow, Craig","subject":"Agile; Software development; Self-organization; Satisfaction;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Innovationsmanagement, Change Management","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"005, 658.406","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Agile software development : practices, self-organization, and satisfaction; Agile; Software development; Self-organization; Satisfaction;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Innovationsmanagement, Change Management; This chapter deals with the Manifesto’s principle of self-organizing teams.

The chapter reveals that the most striking correlation to satisfaction is the level of adoption of self-managing teams, whereas the strongest hindrances to satisfaction are a lack of ability to change the organizational culture and lack of management support. The analysis shows that technical and collaborative practices were related to self-organization and satisfaction, but were not able to explain satisfaction by themselves.

This bachelor thesis investigates driving forces behind the phenomenon including variation between OECD member states and field of study.Since the issue of gender equality has arisen, the phenomenon of gender gaps in general has become increasingly relevant. Gender gaps in education and income are strong indicators for equality in a country’s society, which in turn delivers greater growth and inclusiveness. Although there are already several empirical studies about the growing gender gap in education in OECD member states as well as in other countries around the globe, it has been little empirical research done about the driving forces behind the phenomenon.The findings of this current thesis are in line with the few existing approaches. Mostly external, societal and economic factors were found to be driving forces behind the reversal of the gender gap in education and any variation across OECD countries. Whereas the interaction of external and internal factors explains why there is any female educational advantage possible at all. Against all odds, performance was not found to be responsible for gender variation in the field of study, rather motivation accounts for a bulk of gender differences in certain specialties.","doc_id":9424,"prior":"gender equality","sdg5":1},{"id":"56","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2811","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Biography & Violence : Subjective Processing of Experiences of Violence in Couples' Relationships in the Field of Tension between Subjective and Social Interpretations","authors":"Nef, Susanne","subject":"Häusliche Gewalt; Paargewalt; Deutung;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"300, 362","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Biography & Violence : Subjective Processing of Experiences of Violence in Couples' Relationships in the Field of Tension between Subjective and Social Interpretations; Häusliche Gewalt; Paargewalt; Deutung;  Sozialwissenschaften;  Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste; Interplay of subjective interpretations and self-theories about violence and one’s own experience of violence in the context of biography – How persons affected by partner violence refer to their own biography as an explanation foil: the dynamic interplay between the subjective interpretation of violence, being affected by violence and action, as well as subjective interpretations and self-theories regarding violence (subjective patterns of interpretation) and one’s own biography.","doc_id":9448,"prior":"partner violence","sdg5":1},{"id":"64","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17132","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Health economic analysis of a cluster‐randomised trial (OptiBIRTH) designed to increase rates of vaginal birth after caesarean section","authors":"Fobelets, Maaike; Beeckman, Katrien; Healy, Patricia; Grylka, Susanne; Nicoletti, Jane; Devane, Declan; Gross, Mechthild Maria; Morano, Sandra; Daly, Deirdre; Begley, Cecily; Putman, Koen","subject":"Cost-effectiveness analysis; Elective repeat caesarean; Quality of life; Vaginal birth after caesarean;  Gesundheitsökonomie;  Geburt","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"362.1041, 618.4","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Health economic analysis of a cluster‐randomised trial (OptiBIRTH) designed to increase rates of vaginal birth after caesarean section; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Elective repeat caesarean; Quality of life; Vaginal birth after caesarean;  Gesundheitsökonomie;  Geburt; Der Artikel wurde innerhalb des EU-Projekts OptiBIRTH erstellt.; This is the peer reviewed version of the following article: [Haunberger, S, Rüegger, C, Baumgartner, E.

Ce changement offre de nouvelles possi-bilités d’évaluations, qui peuvent désormais être effectuées non seulement concernant les femmes, mais aussi les contrôles et les visites.","doc_id":9646,"prior":"grossesse","sdg5":1},{"id":"39","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5651","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Dying at life׳s beginning: Experiences of parents and health professionals in Switzerland when an ‘in utero’ diagnosis incompatible with life is made","authors":"Fleming, Valerie; Iljuschin, Irina; Pehlke-Milde, Jessica; Maurer, Franziska; Parpan, Franziska","subject":"Temporality; Fetal; Malformation;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Dying at life׳s beginning: Experiences of parents and health professionals in Switzerland when an ‘in utero’ diagnosis incompatible with life is made; Temporality; Fetal; Malformation;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Objective: The disclosure of a diagnosis during pregnancy of a fetal malformation, which is incompatible with life, normally comes completely unexpectedly to the parents. Although a body of international literature has considered the topic, most of it comes from the United States and little has been generated from Europe. This study aims to illuminate the contemporary treatment associated with such diagnoses, regardless of whether parents decide to terminate or continue the pregnancy.Design: A qualitative design was used with data collected by semi-structured interviews and subjected to a thematic analysis.Setting: The research was conducted in the German speaking areas of Switzerland with data collected from participants in places of their choice.Participants:  interviews were conducted with  parents and  health professionals.Findings: The theme of ‘temporality’ identified four main time points from the professionals: diagnosis, decision, birth/death, and afterwards. However, in contrast to these, six major themes in this study, primarily generated from parents and extended from receiving the diagnosis until the interview, were identified: shock, choices and dilemmas, taking responsibility, still being pregnant, forming a relationship with the baby, letting go. Although there was concurrence on many aspects of care at the point of contact, parents expressed major issues as gaps between the points of contact.Conclusions: Care varied regionally but was as sensitive as possible, attempting to give parents the space to accept their loss but fulfil legal requirements. A gap exists between diagnosis and decision with parents feeling pressured to make decisions regarding continuing or terminating their pregnancies although health professionals’ testimonies indicated otherwise. A major gap manifested following the decision with no palliative care packages offered. During the birth/death of the baby, care was sensitive but another gap manifested following discharge from hospital.","doc_id":9812,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17699","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Maternal health development programs : comparing priorities of bilateral and private donors","authors":"Deleye, Cécile; Lang, Achim","subject":" Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Maternal health development programs : comparing priorities of bilateral and private donors;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Background: The face of international aid for health and development is changing.

So far, resource allocation in reproduction has been studied mainly in females. Intraspecific variation of endogenous energy storage and utilization patterns of males has received little attention, although these patterns may vary greatly between individuals pursuing alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). ARTs are characterized by systematic variation of behavioral, physiological, and often morphological traits among same-sex conspecifics. Some individuals may rely on previously accumulated reserves, because of limited foraging opportunities during reproduction. Others may be able to continue foraging during reproduction, thus relying on reserves to a lesser extent. We therefore predicted that, if male tactics involve such divergent limitations and trade-offs within a species, ARTs should correspondingly differ in energy reserve allocation and utilization. To test this prediction, we studied short-term and long-term reserve storage patterns of males in the shell-brooding cichlid Lamprologus callipterus. In this species, bourgeois males investing in territory defense, courtship, and guarding of broods coexist with two distinct parasitic male tactics: () opportunistic sneaker males attempting to fertilize eggs by releasing sperm into the shell opening when a female is spawning; and () specialized dwarf males attempting to enter the shell past the spawning female to fertilize eggs from inside the shell. Sneaker males differed from other male types by showing the highest amount of accumulated short-term and long-term fat stores, apparently anticipating their upcoming adoption of the nest male status. In contrast, nest males depleted previously accumulated energy reserves with increasing nest holding period, as they invest heavily into costly reproductive behaviors while not taking up any food. This conforms to a capital breeder strategy. Dwarf males did not accumulate long-term fat stores at all, which they can afford due to their small behavioral effort during reproduction and their continued feeding activity, conforming to an income breeder strategy. Our data confirm that the resource storage patterns of males pursuing ARTs can diverge substantially, which adds to our understanding of the coexistence and maintenance of alternative reproductive patterns within species.","doc_id":9908,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24225","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"DevOps adoption : challenges & barriers","authors":"Krey, Mike; Kabbout, Ahmad; Osmani, Lavdrim; Saliji, Armend","subject":"Agile and lean: organization, product and development; Devops implementation; Devops practice; Literature review;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"005","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"DevOps adoption : challenges & barriers; Agile and lean: organization, product and development; Devops implementation; Devops practice; Literature review;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; As a modern software engineering paradigm, DevOps has recently gained increasing acceptance in the industry as a set of practices and cultural values to address daily dynamic software demands.

However, findings across studies are often inconsistent, which may in part be due to differences in stress definitions and assessments.Methods: We systematically reviewed methods applied to assess maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy in studies looking at associations with biobehavioural outcomes in the offspring. A systematic literature search was performed on Web of Science and PubMed for the time period between January  and October . Psychometric instruments assessing maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy were identified and described if data on psychometric properties were available.Results: We identified  publications that assessed psychosocial stress during pregnancy with validated methods. These publications applied overall  different instruments assessing constructs falling under seven categories, ordered according to their frequency of use: anxiety, depression, daily hassles, aspects of psychological symptomatology (not reduced to anxiety or depression), life events, specific socio‐environmental stressors and stress related to pregnancy and parenting. If available, we provide information on validity and reliability of the instruments for samples of pregnant women.Conclusions: Within the ‘prenatal stress’ research, a broad range of instruments is applied to assess psychosocial stress during pregnancy. Prenatal stress research should take into consideration that the variety of methods in use might hamper the comparability of stress research results. In each category of stress constructs, one instrument with good psychometric properties in pregnant women is highlighted as the best currently available measure.","doc_id":10269,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"92","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13596","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Predictors of early postpartum mental distress in mothers with midwifery home care : results from a nested case-control study","authors":"Staehelin, Katharina; Kurth, Elisabeth; Schindler, Christian; Schmid, Monika; Zemp Stutz, Elisabeth","subject":"Risk factors; Switzerland; Home care services; Midwifery; Postnatal care;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Predictors of early postpartum mental distress in mothers with midwifery home care : results from a nested case-control study; Risk factors; Switzerland; Home care services; Midwifery; Postnatal care;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Principles: The prevalence of early postpartum mental health conditions is high.

This study aimed to identify predictors of maternal mental distress in a midwifery home care setting.Methods: Using the statistical database of independent midwives' services in Switzerland in , we conducted a matched nested case-control study. Out of a source population of , mothers with midwifery home care in the first ten days after childbirth,  mothers with maternal distress and , controls, matched by midwife, were included. We analysed whether socio-demographic, maternal and neonatal factors predict maternal mental distress by multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis.Results: Infant crying problems and not living with a partner were the strongest predictors for maternal distress, whereas higher parity was the most protective factor. Significantly elevated risks were also found for older age, lower educational levels, breast/breastfeeding problems, infant weight gain concerns, neonatal pathologies and use of midwifery care during pregnancy. A lower likelihood for maternal distress was seen for non-Swiss nationality, full-time employment before birth, intention to return to work after birth and midwife-led birth.Conclusion: The study informs on predictors of maternal mental distress identified in a home care setting in the early postpartum period. Midwives and other health care professionals should pay particular attention to mothers of excessively crying infants, single mothers and primipara, and assess the need for support of these mothers.","doc_id":10334,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14456","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"A three-generation study on the association of tobacco smoking with asthma","authors":"Accordini, Simone; Calciano, Lucia; Johannessen, Ane; Portas, Laura; Benediktsdóttir, Bryndis; Bertelsen, Randi Jacobsen; Bråbäck, Lennart; Carsin, Anne-Elie; Dharmage, Shyamali C; Dratva, Julia; Forsberg, Bertil; Gomez Real, Francisco; Heinrich, Joachim; Holloway, John W; Holm, Mathias; Janson, Christer; Jögi, Rain; Leynaert, Bénédicte; Malinovschi, Andrei; Marcon, Alessandro; Martínez-Moratalla Rovira, Jesús; Raherison, Chantal; Sánchez-Ramos, José Luis; Schlünssen, Vivi; Bono, Roberto; Corsico, Angelo G; Demoly, Pascal; Dorado Arenas, Sandra; Nowak, Dennis; Pin, Isabelle; Weyler, Joost; Jarvis, Deborah; Svanes, Cecilie","subject":" Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"A three-generation study on the association of tobacco smoking with asthma;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; Background: Mothers’ smoking during pregnancy increases asthma risk in their offspring.

Knowledge of factors that are associated with women's decision-making around mode of birth after CS is important when developing strategies to promote VBAC.

Many studies have examined from a medical and physiological point of view, but research from a women's standpoint is lacking. Our aim was to develop a model of the emerging expectations of giving birth and the subsequent experiences of healthy primigravid women, across four cantons in Switzerland. This longitudinal study included  primigravidae from the German speaking,  from the French speaking and  from the Italian speaking cantons who were purposively selected. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews taking place around  and  weeks of pregnancy and six weeks and six months postnatally. Following Gadamer's hermeneutic, which in this study comprised  stages, a model was developed. Four major themes emerged: Decisions, Care, Influences and Emotions. Their meandering paths and evolution demonstrate the complexity of the expectations and experiences of women becoming mothers. In this study, women's narrated mode of birth expectations did not foretell how they gave birth and their lived experiences. A hermeneutic discontinuity arises at the  week postnatal interview mark. This temporary gap illustrates the bridge between women's expectations of birth and their actual lived experiences, highlighting the importance of informed consent, parent education and ensuring women have a positive birth and immediate postnatal experiences.

Digitalisation, individualisation and the aging of society are leading to increasing traffic, mobility demand and capacity shortages. At the same time, new mobility concepts and offers are under development. In this highly dynamic environment, decision-makers and transport planners are under pressure to react. As society requests new and more comfortable mobility services, car-as well as ridesharing are seen as a part of the solution. Tailor-made mobility services have the potential to meet customer needs and increase the acceptance and use of public transport. In order to better understand the needs, we propose a classification of the commuter society into easily distinguishable groups based on an extensive commuter survey conducted in the city of Basel, Switzerland. This classification should enable more precisely targeted policy measures that save costs and increase adoption of sustainable ways of commuting. Key parameters influencing users’ openness towards car- and ridesharing are derived through an ordinal logistic regression analysis. Together with the classification based on a cluster analysis, they serve as starting points for a sustainable transformation of the commuter environment. The paper further places the findings in context by discussing how recent trends in mobility could support acceptance of new mobility concepts. Successfully transforming today’s commuting realm requires a coordinated effort from both policy-makers and society itself, integrating new and innovative mobility solutions in a public–private form of cooperation.","doc_id":11171,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"21","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15122","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Association between childhood maltreatment and normal adult personality traits : exploration of an understudied field","authors":"Hengartner, Michael Pascal; Cohen, Lisa J.; Rodgers, Stephanie; Müller, Mario; Rössler, Wulf; Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta","subject":"Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Anxiety Disorders; Child; Child Abuse; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Neuroticism; Personality Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Switzerland; Personality;  Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"155","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Association between childhood maltreatment and normal adult personality traits : exploration of an understudied field; Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Anxiety Disorders; Child; Child Abuse; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Neuroticism; Personality Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Switzerland; Personality;  Differentielle Psychologie und Entwicklungspsychologie; We assessed normal personality traits and childhood trauma in approximately  subjects from a general population-based community sample.

Research in the field of social sciences offers various theoretical and methodological approaches to explain acceptance, acceptability and technology adoption. Different criteria of acceptance are used, e.g. utility, ease of use, aesthetics, contextual, individual and social differences. From the perspective of the actor network theory (ANT) (Callon ; Latour ) new technologies are the result of many interconnected and heterogeneous actors. They cannot be fully understood if they are considered as isolated technical artifacts (Callon ).This work will examine acceptance and acceptability of technologies as network formation and not, as in conventional technology acceptance models, as adoption by individual human actors. Using the concept of translation sociology (Callon , ), the acceptance work necessary for network formation was examined.For this purpose, a case study on the actibelt® technology (www.actibelt.com) was conducted. The actibelt® is a body tracking technology that measures physical activity of patients over a period of several days using a belt with an integrated activity sensor. The aim of this work is to reconstruct the actibelt from the perspective of ANT, with a focus on the non-humans of the actibelt-actor-network.Drawing on qualitative interviews with users (patients, health professionals) and technology developers, and ethnographic observations, this study explored the question of how non-human actors contribute to the acceptability of technologies.As a result, the (technical) actibelt®-Actor-Network and five modes of acceptance work by non-human actors and their effects on patients were identified. The different modes of acceptance work show that non-human actors, such as events, meetings, graphs and socio-technical discourses, participating in the actibelt-actor-network. Non-humans are not passive actors in the development of technology, but can enable, hinder or condition acceptability. Therefore, non-human actors play a central and constitutive role in the translation process by performing acceptance work and contributing to the stabilisation and acceptability of the actibelt®-Actor-Network.","doc_id":11316,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21722","date":"2021","language":"de","title":"Bürgerlich/Rechts und homosexuell – ein Widerspruch? : eine kritische Argumentationsanalyse bürgerlicher und rechter Parteien sowie ihrer homosexuellen Vereinigungen in Deutschland und in der Schweiz","authors":"Caflisch, Madlaina","subject":"Argumentationsanalyse; Argumentation analysis; Politikdiskurs; Political discourse; Politisches Argumentieren; Political Argumentation; Topos;  Politik;  Terminologie, Diskursanalyse, Pragmatik","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"320, 401.4","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Bürgerlich/Rechts und homosexuell – ein Widerspruch? : eine kritische Argumentationsanalyse bürgerlicher und rechter Parteien sowie ihrer homosexuellen Vereinigungen in Deutschland und in der Schweiz; Argumentationsanalyse; Argumentation analysis; Politikdiskurs; Political discourse; Politisches Argumentieren; Political Argumentation; Topos;  Politik;  Terminologie, Diskursanalyse, Pragmatik; Die Debatte um die Ehe für gleichgeschlechtliche Paare ist in der Schweiz derzeit in vollem Gange und Argumente dafür oder dagegen sind zahlreich. Klassische Gegner einer gleichgeschlechtlichen Ehe sind rechte, konservative Parteien, die am Institut der Ehe zwischen Mann und Frau festhalten und sich insbesondere um das Kindeswohl in Regenbogenfamilien sorgen. Weshalb bilden sich in solchen Parteien Vereinigungen von offen homosexuellen Mitgliedern? Was bewegt diese Menschen, einer Partei beizutreten, die sich gegen mehr Rechte für Homosexuelle wehrt? In dieser Masterarbeit soll anhand einer Argumentationsanalyse basierend auf Schulen der kritischen Diskurslinguistik untersucht werden, wie Homosexuelle ihre Parteizugehörigkeit rechtfertigen und ob sich hinter ihrer Argumentation Widersprüche verbergen. Dazu werden einerseits Parteiprogramme, Parlamentsdebatten, Leitlinien und Stellungnahmen von SVP, CDU und AfD sowie ihren jeweiligen homosexuellen Vereinigungen und andererseits selbst geführte Interviews mit Vertretern letzterer auf Argumentationsmuster sowie Topoi untersucht. Die Untersuchung ergibt, dass die sexuelle Orientierung für viele nur zweitrangig ist und die Parteizugehörigkeit mit einer grossen Deckungsgleichheit von Werten begründet wird. Ausserdem wird von einigen die Andersartigkeit von Homosexuellen und der Wunsch der Anerkennung ebenjener hervorgehoben. Widersprüche ergeben sich v.a. in Akzeptanz und Stellenwert der eigenen Sexualität sowie im Versuch, die eigene Partei von Diskriminierungsvorwürfen zu befreien.The debate about marriage for same-sex couples is currently in full swing in Switzerland and there are numerous arguments for and against it. Opponents of same-sex marriage are mostly right-wing, conservative parties who cling to the institute of marriage between a man and a woman and are particularly concerned about the welfare of children in homoparental families. How is it that associations of openly homosexual members are formed in such parties? What motivates these people to join a party that is against equal rights for homosexuals? In this Master's thesis, an argumentation analysis based on the schools of critical discourse linguists will be used to examine how homosexuals justify their party affiliation and whether contradictions are hidden beneath their argumentation. For this purpose, party programmes, parliamentary debates, guidelines and statements of the Swiss People’s Party, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Alternative for Germany as well as their respective homosexual associations, and interviews with representatives of the latter will be examined for argumentation patterns and topoi. The study shows that sexual orientation, to many, is of only secondary importance and that party membership is based on the best congruence of values. In addition, some emphasize otherness of homosexuals and the desire for recognition of the same. Contradictions arise above all in the acceptance and significance of one's own sexuality and in attempts to clear the party from accusations of discrimination.","doc_id":11497,"prior":"woman","sdg5":1},{"id":"1","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21986","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Factors affecting women's autonomous decision making in research participation amongst Yoruba women of Western Nigeria","authors":"Princewill, Chitu Womehoma; Jegede, Ayodele; Nordström, Karin; Lanre-Abass, Bolatito; Elger, Bernice Simone","subject":"Nigeria; Women’s autonomy; Patriarchy; Culture; Religion; Research participation;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"000, 305","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Factors affecting women's autonomous decision making in research participation amongst Yoruba women of Western Nigeria; Nigeria; Women’s autonomy; Patriarchy; Culture; Religion; Research participation;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Personengruppen (Alter, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Einkommen); Research is a global enterprise requiring participation of both genders for generalizable knowledge; advancement of science and evidence based medical treatment. Participation of women in research is necessary to reduce the current bias that most empirical evidence is obtained from studies with men to inform health care and related policy interventions. Various factors are assumed to limit autonomy amongst the Yoruba women of western Nigeria. This paper seeks to explore the experience and understanding of autonomy by the Yoruba women in relation to research participation. Focus is on factors that affect women's autonomous decision making in research participation.An exploratory qualitative approach comprising four focus group discussions,  in‐depth interviews and  key informant interviews was used. The study permits a significant amount of triangulation, as opinions of husbands and religious leaders are also explored. Interviews and discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was employed for data analysis.Findings show that concepts of autonomy varied amongst the Yoruba women. Patriarchy, religion and culture are conceived to have negative impact on the autonomy of women in respect to research participation. Among the important findings are: ) male dominance is strongly emphasized by religious leaders who should teach equality, ) while men feel that by making decisions for women, they are protecting them, the women on the other hand see this protection as a way of limiting their autonomy. We recommend further studies to develop culturally appropriate and workable recruitment methods to increase women's participation in research.","doc_id":11563,"prior":"women's participation","sdg5":1},{"id":"93","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14667","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"A cross-country survey of attitudes toward childbirth technologies and interventions among university students","authors":"Stoll, Kathrin; Edmonds, Joyce; Sadler, Michelle; Thomson, Gill; McAra-Couper, Judith; Swift, Emma M.; Malott, Anne; Streffing, Joana; Gross, Mechthild Maria; Downe, Soo","subject":"Attitude; Birth; Survey; Technology; Young adults;  Soziale Prozesse;  Geburt","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"303, 618.4","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"A cross-country survey of attitudes toward childbirth technologies and interventions among university students; Attitude; Birth; Survey; Technology; Young adults;  Soziale Prozesse;  Geburt; Problem & aim: Cultural beliefs that equate birth technology with progress, safety and convenience contribute to widespread acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions. Little is known about attitudes towards childbirth technology and interventions among the next generation of maternity care users and whether attitudes vary by country, age, gender, childbirth fear, and other factors. Methods: Data were collected via online survey in eight countries. Students who had never had children, and who planned to have at least one child were eligible to participate. Findings: The majority of participants (n=) were women (.%), and the median age was  years. More than half of students agreed that birth technology makes birth easier (.%), protects babies from harm (.%) and that women have a right to choose a medically non-indicated cesarean (.%). Respondents who had greater acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions were from countries with higher national caesarean birth rates, reported higher levels of childbirth fear, and were more likely to report that visual media or school-based education shaped their attitudes toward birth. Positive attitudes toward childbirth technology and interventions were also associated with less confidence in knowledge of birth, and more common among younger and male respondents. Discussion/conclusion: Educational strategies to teach university students about pregnancy and birth in ways that does not frighten them and promotes critical reflection about childbirth technology are needed. This is especially true in countries with high rates of interventions that reciprocally shape culture norms, attitudes, and expectations.","doc_id":11653,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"94","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8480","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Accounting for government interventions in the corporate sector : consolidation to be revisited","authors":"Bergmann, Andreas","subject":" Rechnungswesen;  Leitendes Management","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"657, 658.4","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Accounting for government interventions in the corporate sector : consolidation to be revisited;  Rechnungswesen;  Leitendes Management; The financial reporting standards are providing sufficient guidance for basically all aspects of government interventions into the corporate sector during the financial crisis.

Despite its origins in the s, ecological engineering remains a niche discipline, while at the same time, there has never been a greater need to combine the rigour of engineering and science with the systems-approach of ecology for pro-active management of Earth’s biodiversity and environmental life-support systems. Broad consensus on the scope and defining elements of ecological engineering and development of a globally consistent ecological engineering curriculum are key pillars to mainstream recognition of the discipline and practice of ecological engineering.The Importance of Ecological Engineering in Society: In this paper, the importance of ecological engineering education is discussed in relation to the perceived need of our society to address global challenges of sustainable development. The perceived needs of industry, practitioners, educators and students for skills in ecological engineering are also discussed.The Importance and Need for Ecological Engineering Education: The need for integrative, interdisciplinary education is discussed in relation to the scope of ecology, engineering and the unique role of ecological engineering.Scope for a Universally Recognised Curriculum in Ecological Engineering: The scope for a universally recognised curriculum in ecological engineering is presented. The curriculum recognises a set of overarching principles and concepts that unite multiple application areas of ecological engineering practice. The integrative, systems-based approach of ecological engineering distinguishes it from the trend toward narrow specialisation in education. It is argued that the systems approach to conceptualising problems of design incorporating ecological principles is a central tenant of ecological engineering practice.Challenges to Wider Adoption of Ecological Engineering and Opportunities to Increase Adoption: Challenges and structural barriers to wider adoption of ecological engineering principles, embedded in our society’s reliance on technological solutions to environmental problems, are discussed along with opportunities to increase adoption of ecological engineering practice. It is suggested that unifying the numerous specialist activity areas and applications of ecological engineering under an umbrella encompassing a set of core principles, approaches, tools and way of thinking is required to distinguish ecological engineering from other engineering disciplines and scale up implementation of the discipline. It is concluded that these challenges can only be realised if ecological engineering moves beyond application by a relatively small band of enthusiastic practitioners, learning by doing, to the education of future cohorts of students who will become tomorrow’s engineers, project managers, procurement officers and decision makers, applying principles informed by a growing body of theory and knowledge generated by an active research community, a need whose time has come, if we are to deploy all tools at our disposal toward addressing the grand challenge of creating a sustainable future.","doc_id":12114,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17251","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Maternal age at delivery, lung function and asthma in offspring : a population-based survey","authors":"Gómez Real, Francisco; Burgess, John A.; Villani, Simona; Dratva, Julia; Heinrich, Joachim; Janson, Christer; Jarvis, Debbie; Koplin, Jennifer; Leynaert, Bénédicte; Lodge, Caroline; Lærum, Birger N.; Matheson, Melanie C.; Norbäck, Dan; Omenaas, Ernst R.; Skulstad, Svein M.; Sunyer, Jordi; Dharmage, Shyamali C.; Svanes, Cecilie","subject":"Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Female; Forced expiratory volume; Health survey; Human; Immunoglobulin E; Internationality; Linear model; Logistic model; Lung; Male; Middle aged; Pregnancy; Prenatal exposure delayed effect; Sex factor; Smoking; Young adult; Maternal age;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"616","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Maternal age at delivery, lung function and asthma in offspring : a population-based survey; Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Female; Forced expiratory volume; Health survey; Human; Immunoglobulin E; Internationality; Linear model; Logistic model; Lung; Male; Middle aged; Pregnancy; Prenatal exposure delayed effect; Sex factor; Smoking; Young adult; Maternal age;  Innere Medizin und Krankheiten; There is limited information about potential impact of maternal age on the respiratory health of offspring.

Among these patients, about one sixth included women of childbearing potential. Therefore, the wish of getting pregnant is frequent in these peculiar patients, and careful planning and management of the pregnancies requires the expertise of obstetricians, midwives and transplant experts. Altogether, the outcome of the pregnancies in these women is acceptable. About % off all pregnancies ended successfully with live births, and this is comparable if not superior to pregnancies in healthy women. This success might be caused not only by the special and intensive care provided to these high-risk pregnancies by the transplant centres but also by the low rate of unplanned pregnancies. The risk of rejections and organ loss after delivery is about %, and it is slightly enhanced in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) in comparison to kidney graft recipients (KTRs) but the number of organ losses in direct association with a pregnancy is rare. However, there is not only a higher frequency of pregnancy-associated disorders such as pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery but also an acceleration of hypertension, new-onset diabetes mellitus and newly arising infections also favoured by the maintained immunosuppressive therapy. This implies a specialized 'control system' for these pregnant women that comprises ultrasound and Doppler investigation for risk assessment, infection screening, suitable therapy and the choice of non-teratogenic immunosuppressives. Antihypertensive treatment must be well balanced and adjusted to the possible growth-retarding effect on the foetus as well as on the co-morbidity of the mother. Finally, supplementation of vitamin D and iron is much more important in these transplanted women than in healthy pregnant women as vitamin D deficiency and anaemia are discussed to have an impact on pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery. These claims are widely discussed.

On this basis, the concept of CSR as it is practiced today—predominantly referred to as ‘sustainability’—became established after the year .The Swiss economy is based on the concept of a liberal economic system. This results in a policy of a minimalist state establishing the necessary framework—effective environmental legislation and protective social and labor laws—for the economy itself to follow. The state thus plays a minor role in regulating CSR, which is seen as business-driven. Compared to other European countries, the Swiss have fewer statutory requirements for CSR activities (e.g. reporting). However, the government promotes moderate CSR by providing guidelines and incentives for appropriate behavior (State Secretariat for Economic Affairs [SECO], a). In addition, Switzerland’s economy is seen as highly globalized with a strong export orientation. Hence, most Swiss companies operate in an international context where they depend on, and at the same time profit from, globalized supply chains. According to the Swiss Corporate Sustainability Survey  (Berger et al. (Swiss Corporate Sustainability Survey . Nachhaltigkeit in Schweizer Unternehmen. ZHAW School of Management and Law, )), Swiss companies are well aware of the importance of CSR and actively engage in CSR activities (Schaltegger et al. (International corporate sustainability barometer. A comparative analysis of  countries. CSM, Leuphana University Lüneburg, )), although they may be reluctant to discuss them publicly. There seems to be a difference between large companies and SMEs in their commitment to CSR and their approach to CSR practices due to the availability of human and financial resources. Major CSR issues for Swiss companies include energy efficiency and the reduction of CO emissions (environmental), employee health, gender equality and human rights in the supply chain (social) as well as tax evasion and excessive executives’ salaries (governance).","doc_id":12911,"prior":"gender equality","sdg5":1},{"id":"28","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8078","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Visual eHealth : an ICT innovation and dissemination strategy to improve our well-being","authors":"Pauchard, Yves; Ackermann, Philipp","subject":"Visualization; eHealth;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Medizin und Gesundheit","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"005, 610","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Visual eHealth : an ICT innovation and dissemination strategy to improve our well-being; Visualization; eHealth;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Medizin und Gesundheit; Healthcare activities take place in a multi-disciplinary environment and on a cross-organizational scale.

In case of illness, the medical information delivered by health professionals can be overwhelming because of its complexity, unfamiliar terminology, and use of statistical data. Understanding such information requires specifc “health literacy” skills. Health literacy empowers individuals to exercise their autonomy and self-determination regarding health-related matters. This chapter explores how health literacy and ethical questions are interrelated as illustrated using actual patient narratives of a woman’s pregnancy experiences. The narratives were collected as part of the Swiss DIPEx (Database of individual patients’ experiences) database. We demonstrate that narratives of health experiences can be used to enhance health literacy. Firstly, narratives can convey complex information in an easily understandable manner. Secondly, they allow policymakers to understand, the informational needs of users of the health care system and the communication gaps they perceive can help improve the health care system and qualitative evaluate and improve medical communication efforts.

Current drivers such as consumer’s demand for safer, “healthier,” and higher-quality foods, ideally with a long shelf-life; the demand for convenient and transparent packaging, and the preference for more sustainable packaging materials, have led to the development of new packaging technologies, such as active packaging (AP). As defined in the European regulation (EC) No /, AP systems are designed to “deliberately incorporate components that would release or absorb substances into or from the packaged food or the environment surrounding the food.” Active packaging materials are thereby \"intended to extend the shelf-life or to maintain or improve the condition of packaged food.” Although extensive research on AP technologies is being undertaken, many of these technologies have not yet been implemented successfully in commercial food packaging systems. Broad communication of their benefits in food product applications will facilitate the successful development and market introduction.

The literature shows that the hospitalisation rate in rehabilitation facilities has increased in recent years and that a gender bias exists. Additionally, there is little or no evidence available on the effect that a post‑acute care programme might have over an extended period on functioning, quality of life and the informal network of older people. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the sustainability of post‑acute care within three nursing homes in Zurich, Canton of Zurich, Switzerland.Methods: The Prevention Admission into Nursing homes (PAN) study is a explorative, prospective, longitudinal pilot trial based on a convenience sample of three long‑term care facilities in the Swiss Canton of Zurich. The proposed pilot study will examine the effects of a post‑acute care programme on people aged ≥ years with a post‑acute care potential ≥ three admitted to any of the three post‑acute care units (n = ). Older people of all sexes admitted to one of the post‑acute care units and likely to be discharged to home within  weeks will be eligible for participation in the study.

To fill this gap, we examine the economic effects of MAAS implementation on Swiss state level, taking into account different types and magnitudes of reforms.Design/Methodology/Approach: Based on public transition reports, we manually compile a database representing the full sample of all  Swiss cantons. The assessment framework allows us to eliminate time effects giving rise to counterfactual evidence, since transition reports include original and restated values for the same reporting period. We use Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Pearson correlation analysis to draw our main findings.Findings: We find significant economic impact resulting from MAAS implementation, therefore containing decision-relevant information for internal and external stakeholders. Strong impact correlations between economic effects and magnitudes of accounting reforms can be found, with IPSAS having the largest economic consequences. Key finding is, that the implementation of MAAS might lead to a higher valued economic substance with assets increasing more than liabilities. This, in turn, has an direct impact on equity numbers and other key financial indicators.Originality/Value: To our best knowledge this is the first paper that investigates the impact of MAAS implementation. Therefore, it complements the existing public financial management literature and sets the base for further research in this area.","doc_id":13476,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"5","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24326","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"The “Zurich adoption study”","authors":"Gabriel, Thomas; Keller, Samuel","subject":"Adoption; Child Care; Kinder- und Jugendhilfe;  Jugendhilfe","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"362.7","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"The “Zurich adoption study”; Adoption; Child Care; Kinder- und Jugendhilfe;  Jugendhilfe; The “Zurich Adoption Study” is a longitudinal mixed methods study.

Women’s own perceptions of alcohol as risk during pregnancy however, are varied and practices range from abstinence to occasional or regular alcohol consumption. In our study, which focuses on expecting couples living in Switzerland, we aim to understand the way that pregnant women and their male partners perceive this risk and how they construct the boundaries between “harmful”, “risky” and “safe” daily habits. To this end, we used a rare methodological set-up among studies on risk and pregnancy: we conducted separate interviews with both partners of  couples, in the Lausanne and Zurich areas.Based on a thematic analysis, our findings indicate that pregnancy is a transition period during which boundaries around health risk-assessment emerge within the couple, with women tending to take on the responsibility for the fetus’s health, seeking information on everything from prenatal screenings to diet and alcohol consumption. We identified three ideal-types concerning women’s risk perception and alcohol consumption during pregnancy, with the women’s information-seeking behavior playing an important part in shaping risk perception. Furthermore, we found that male partners take on a supportive role during this stage, enforcing the women’s strategies of risk diminution – a dynamic, which can lead to an early solidification of gender roles in child rearing.","doc_id":13715,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23045","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Ecosystem readiness : blockchain adoption is driven externally","authors":"Lustenberger, Michael; Malešević , Saša; Spychiger, Florian","subject":"Adoption; BAM; Blockchain; Ecosystem;  Finanzwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"332","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Ecosystem readiness : blockchain adoption is driven externally; Adoption; BAM; Blockchain; Ecosystem;  Finanzwirtschaft; Blockchain technology has been extensively tested, implemented, used, or even abandoned by organizations.

Agreement on a core set of reliable, valid and accessible outcome measures to assess rehabilitation outcomes is needed to generate strong evidence about effectiveness of rehabilitation approaches, including technologies. This paper collates and synthesizes a core set from multiple sources; combining existing evidence, clinical practice guidelines and expert consensus into European recommendations for Clinical Assessment of Upper Limb In Neurorehabilitation (CAULIN).Methods: Data from systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines and expert consensus (Delphi methodology) were systematically extracted and synthesized using strength of evidence rating criteria, in addition to recommendations on assessment procedures. Three sets were defined: a core set: strong evidence for validity, reliability, responsiveness and clinical utility AND recommended by at least two sources; an extended set: strong evidence OR recommended by at least two sources and a supplementary set: some evidence OR recommended by at least one of the sources.Results: In total,  measures (with primary focus on stroke) were included, encompassing body function and activity level of the International Classification of Functioning and Health. The core set recommended for clinical practice and research: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT); the extended set recommended for clinical practice and/or clinical research: kinematic measures, Box and Block Test (BBT), Chedoke Arm Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and ABILHAND; the supplementary set recommended for research or specific occasions: Motricity Index (MI); Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA), Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment Movement (STREAM), Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) and body-worn movement sensors. Assessments should be conducted at pre-defined regular intervals by trained personnel. Global measures should be applied within  h of hospital admission and upper limb specific measures within  week.Conclusions: The CAULIN recommendations for outcome measures and assessment procedures provide a clear, simple, evidence-based three-level structure for upper limb assessment in neurological rehabilitation. Widespread adoption and sustained use will improve quality of clinical practice and facilitate meta-analysis, critical for the advancement of technology-supported neurorehabilitation.","doc_id":14040,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"100","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/18173","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"The status of perception, information exposure and knowledge of soil fertility among small-scale farmers in Ghana, Kenya, Mali and Zambia","authors":"Spurk, Christoph; Asule, Pamellah; Baah-Ofori, Rebecca; Chikopela, Louis; Diarra, Boubacar; Koch, Carmen","subject":" Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"000, 630","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"The status of perception, information exposure and knowledge of soil fertility among small-scale farmers in Ghana, Kenya, Mali and Zambia;  Allgemeines und Wissenschaft;  Landwirtschaft; Purpose: Soil fertility is decreasing in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. To mitigate this trend, various agricultural technologies are available, but their uptake by farmers has been low. Perception of the problem, information exposure, and knowledge play a major role in adoption of technologies. This study assessed empirically the levels of perception, knowledge and information exposure among African farmers as an indicator for potential adoption of soil fertility technologies.Design/Methodology/approach: The study used survey data of more than , small-scale farmers selected through random sampling from Ghana, Kenya, Mali and Zambia. The survey investigated socio-economic factors, exposure to media, perception and knowledge of soil fertility and other information. Findings: Many farmers did not perceive soil fertility as a major challenge, except in Mali; farmers were hardly receiving information on soil fertility from professional agricultural sources, and they often lacked accurate knowledge about soil fertility technologies. Radio was by far the most used information source for farmers.Practical implications: The study has exposed the need for interventions to increase awareness, information exposure, and knowledge about soil fertility among farmers to strengthen the adoption of soil fertility technologies. It also calls for innovative ways of strengthening extension services through links with radio. Theoretical implications: The role of communication in the uptake of agricultural innovations is still under-researched, and hence this study exposes the need to investigate in-depth knowledge, perception levels, and quality and frequency of information exposure on various channels of soil fertility management.

Die Studie zeichnet alle zwei Jahre ein Bild der Freizeitgestaltung und des medialen Alltags von Jugendlichen. Im Jahr  sind Daten von  Heranwachsenden aus der deutsch-, französisch- und italienischsprachigen Schweiz in die Auswertungen miteingeflossen. Aufgrund der pandemiebedingten Schulschliessungen konnten die schriftlichen Befragungen nicht wie gewohnt vor Ort durchgeführt werden. Die Erhebung fand deshalb online statt und die Jugendlichen konnten den Fragebogen von zuhause aus bearbeiten. Durch das veränderte Befragungssetting war die Studienteilnahme für die Jugendlichen weniger verbindlich, was sich in einer höheren Abbruchquote bemerkbar machte. Die Repräsentativität der Stichprobe ist somit im Vergleich zu den Vorjahren eingeschränkt. Dies gilt es bei der Interpretation der Befunde zu berücksichtigen.Hinsichtlich der nonmedialen Freizeitgestaltung zeigt sich , dass Jugendliche mehr Zeit mit der Familie und weniger mit Freundinnen und Freunden verbringen. Dies lässt sich einerseits mit den Corona-bedingten Einschränkungen erklären, entspricht gleichzeitig aber auch einem Trend, der sich bereits vor zwei Jahren abzeichnete. Bei der Verfügbarkeit von Medienabonnements zeigen sich deutliche Veränderungen. Unterhaltungsorientierte Streaming-Dienste haben in den letzten zwei Jahren nochmals klar zugelegt. In drei Vierteln der Haushalte mit Jugendlichen ist heute ein Abonnement vorhanden, um Filme und Serien zu streamen, und auch Musik-Streaming und Game-Flatrate-Abonnements haben in ihrer Verbreitung nochmals zugenommen. Über den Zeitraum der letzten zehn Jahre haben dagegen publizistische Angebote stetig an Bedeutung verloren. Dies zeigt sich auch im Mediennutzungsverhalten. Jugendliche lesen immer weniger Zeitungen und Zeitschriften – sowohl online als auch in gedruckter Version. Auch andere klassische Medienangebote wie Radio und Fernsehen werden von Jugendlichen immer seltener genutzt. Einen Bedeutungszuwachs verzeichnet hingegen das Erstellen von digitalem Bildmaterial. Fotos und Videos werden im Alltag der Jugendlichen immer wichtiger. Neben diesen dynamischen Entwicklungen ist der Stellenwert von anderen Medientätigkeiten seit zehn Jahren unverändert geblieben. So spielen seit der ersten Erhebung rund  % aller Jugendlichen regelmässig Videogames und ein Viertel der Befragten liest regelmässig Bücher. Auch ist der mediale Alltag von Jugendlichen schon seit Längerem durch das Handy und das Internet geprägt. In der Schweiz sind kaum noch Jugendliche zu finden, die nicht täglich ein Handy und das Internet nutzen. Die Zeit, die Jugendliche am Handy verbringen, hat im Vergleich zur letzten Erhebung insbesondere am Wochenende nochmals stark zugenommen. Neben Handy und Internet spielen Musik und soziale Netzwerke eine ähnlich zentrale Rolle im Leben der Jugendlichen.  % der Heranwachsenden haben ein Profil bei Instagram und bei Snapchat. TikTok ist der grosse Aufsteiger unter den sozialen Netzwerken und verzeichnet über die letzten zwei Jahre einen deutlichen Zuwachs. Drei Viertel aller Jugendlichen verfügen heute über einen TikTok Account, während es  lediglich  % waren. Hinsichtlich potenzieller Risiken der Mediennutzung ist insbesondere die Zunahme sexueller Belästigung im Internet augenfällig.  % der Jugendlichen geben an, bereits einmal ungewollt von einer fremden Person mit sexuellen Absichten kontaktiert worden zu sein. Hier gilt es Jugendliche zu sensibilisieren und im Umgang mit solchen Erlebnissen zu schulen. Zugleich sollte der Jugendmedienschutz verstärkt werden.JAMES stands for Jugend, Aktivitäten, Medien – Erhebung Schweiz (Youth, Activities, Media: Survey Switzerland. This biennial study portrays adolescents’ leisure activities and media routines. For the  survey, data collected from  adolescents from the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland were fed into the evaluations. Due to the pandemic-related closing of schools, the written interviews could not be held on-site as usual. The survey was, therefore, conducted online and the adolescents could work on the questionnaire from home. The changed interview setting made for lower commitment to participation in the study by the adolescents, which manifested itself in a higher dropout rate. The sample representativity is, therefore, lower than in previous years. In interpreting the findings, this has to be taken into account. As to the nonmedia-related leisure activities, it became apparent in  that adolescents spend more time with their families and less with friends. This can be explained, on one hand, by the restrictions imposed because of Covid-, but it also corresponds to a trend that already emerged two years ago. Marked changes show in the availability of media subscriptions. Entertainment-oriented streaming services have clearly gained ground again during the past two years. Three quarters of the households where adolescents live have a subscription for streaming movies and series now, and flatrate subscriptions for streaming music and games have continued to gain ground. Consumption of journalistic content, on the other hand, has declined steadily over the last decade. This is apparent in media use behavior, too. Adolescents read less and less newspapers and magazines—online as well as in print. Other classical media like radio and television are used more and more rarely by adolescents. On the contrary, producing digital image material is on the rise. Photos and videos are gaining more and more importance in adolescents’ everyday lives. Apart from these dynamic developments, the significance of other media activities has remained unchanged for a decade: all surveys since the first show that around  % of all adolescents play video games on a regular basis, and a quarter of the interviewees regularly read books. Moreover, adolescents’ everyday lives with media have been dominated by the cell phone and the internet for quite some time. In Switzerland, it is hard to find adolescents now who do not use a cell phone and the internet every day. Compared to the previous survey, the time adolescents spend on cell phones has continued to increase sharply, in particular on weekends. In addition to the cell phone and internet, music and social networks play a similarly central role in adolescents’ lives.  % of the adolescents have Instagram and Snapchat profiles. TikTok is the rising star among social networks and shows considerable growth over the past two years. Three quarters of all adolescents now have TikTok accounts, up from just  % in . With regard to potential risks of media use, the increase of sexual harassment via internet is particularly conspicuous.  % of the adolescents report having had an experience of unwanted sexually motivated contact by strangers. In this context, it is necessary to sensitize adolescents and to train them in dealing with these experiences. In parallel, youth media protection should be enhanced.","doc_id":15486,"prior":"sexual harassment","sdg5":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11143","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A nurse-delivered, clinic-based intervention to address intimate partner violence among low-income women in Mexico City : findings from a cluster randomized controlled trial","authors":"Gupta, Jhumka; Falb, Kathryn L.; Ponta, Oriana; Xuan, Ziming; Campos, Paola Abril; Gomez, Annabel Arellano; Valades, Jimena; Cariño, Gisele; Olavarrieta, Claudia Diaz","subject":"Health sector; Intimate partner violence; Violence against women; Quality of life;  Kultur;  Pflege","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"306, 610.73","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"A nurse-delivered, clinic-based intervention to address intimate partner violence among low-income women in Mexico City : findings from a cluster randomized controlled trial; Health sector; Intimate partner violence; Violence against women; Quality of life;  Kultur;  Pflege; Background: Rigorous evaluations of health sector interventions addressing intimate partner violence (IPV) in low- and middle-income countries are lacking.

Mothers completed the Inventory of Life Events (second trimester: T), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, third trimester: T), the Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress (TICS-K, - weeks postpartum) and provided saliva samples (T, T) for maternal cortisol profiles, as computed by the area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) or increase (AUCi) for the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and for diurnal cortisol profiles (DAY). OXTR DNA methylation was quantified using Sequenom EpiTYPER. The number of stressful life events (P = .), EPDS score (P = .) and cortisol AUCgs at T (CAR: P = .; DAY: P = .) were negatively associated with OXTR DNA methylation.

Higher education institutions focusing on quality presence labs with the need for occasional online teaching are thus looking for blended and multimodal solutions in which the physical interaction can be carried over as much as possible into the digital channels. In these solutions, various touch points between the physical and digital worlds should be exploited. This paper contributes such a solution. It introduces a cyber-physical educational support structure called EPOSS aimed at programming ’things’, including robots and derivative stationary and mobile units, that works in flexible lab and online teaching combinations.

Therefore, identities are complex, while misunderstandings are common, and there is a need for more intercultural dialogue. How can media education take into account these transcultural negotiations, which are largely taking place in and through media? How can we support young people in particular? This article reflects upon the kinds of pedagogical interventions that can promote the development of migrant youth transcultural media competencies, drawing upon the action research found in “Young people in the limelight: Towards agency through multiliteracies” (-). This study is based on seven media workshops organized around Finland in youth organizations and schools.Adopting the pedagogy of multiliteracies as a starting point (e.g. Cazden et al., ), this article explores teachers’ opportunities and challenges in three approaches to pedagogical intervention in transcultural media  competencies: )  considering  the  living  worlds  of  young  people  in  media  pedagogy, )  utilizing  existing media capabilities and ) supporting young people’s transcultural identifications.The results show that hands-on media education, particularly community-based media participation, offers various opportunities for pedagogical intervention. However, the successful adoption of transcultural perspectives in educational settings depends upon an explicit understanding of the goals and means of transcultural education. Thus, there seems to be an urgent need to improve teacher education regarding transcultural media competencies for enhancing the intercultural dialogue globally and supporting gender identity.","doc_id":16245,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"86","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8191","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Auf einmal warst du da : Ursachen, Hintergründe und Erklärungsansätze der negierten Schwangerschaft","authors":"Künzi, Belinda; Eugster, Sarah","subject":"Negierte Schwangerschaft; Schwangerschaftsverdrängung; Verdrängte Schwangerschaft; Ursachen; Erklärungsansätze; Hintergründe; Denial of pregnancy; Gravitas suppressalis;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"618","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Auf einmal warst du da : Ursachen, Hintergründe und Erklärungsansätze der negierten Schwangerschaft; Negierte Schwangerschaft; Schwangerschaftsverdrängung; Verdrängte Schwangerschaft; Ursachen; Erklärungsansätze; Hintergründe; Denial of pregnancy; Gravitas suppressalis;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Laut Bass, Castelberg und Fleischli () wird eine negierte, also verdrängte Schwangerschaft als solche definiert, wenn die Schwangerschaft erst zwischen der .

Das Ziel der Verfasserinnen ist es, mit dieser Bachelorarbeit die negierte Schwangerschaft zu erklären und verbreitete Vorurteile zu bestätigen oder zu widerlegen. Dadurch soll eine Sensibilisierung und Aufklärung der Hebammen erreicht und somit das Verständnis für Betroffene erhöht werden. Zum Erreichen dieses Ziels wurde mithilfe definierter Suchbegriffe auf verschiedenen Datenbanken und anhand einer lateralen Recherche nach relevanter Literatur gesucht. Da es sich um eine themengeleitete Bachelorarbeit handelt, wurden nebst einer Studie auch sieben Fachartikel, die den Ein- und Ausschlusskriterien entsprachen, analysiert und diskutiert.

Moreover the Swiss healthcare system is undergoing major changes and the areas of work of midwives are changing too. Midwives must possess advanced professional and academic skills. Clinics require midwives who can apply advanced knowledge and are able to implement it in everyday practice as well as guide, accompany and advise colleagues. Self-employed midwives need evidence-based knowledge to provide expert care to women and their families. Midwives with advanced skills contribute significantly to securing and improving the quality of care for women and their families, and also take on new roles in an inter-professional context.Aim: To develop a continuing education programme for midwives at the University of Applied Sciences which concludes with a MAS. The focus is on specialised knowledge which is scientifically based and directly related to the practical activity of a midwife.Structure: The MAS in Midwifery Skills plus consists of  modules and a master thesis. The modular design of the MAS allows individual planning of this part-time continuing education programme. The contents can be chosen according to personal and professional interests.Content: The contents focus on the various areas of activity of midwives while going into more detail on understanding pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period in relation to independent midwifery care. Job perspectives: Midwives with a MAS take on new areas or the functional management of one or more areas.

One challenge faced by these nations is that peak household electricity demand often does not correspond with the peak production of renewables such as photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Load-shifting via the use of smart appliances provides one option to better match renewable electricity production with household electricity demand. However, load-shifting requires the adoption of smart grid and smart metering technologies, which the public often views as a form of surrender to a lack of control and data security issues. Thus, load-shifting might encounter social disapproval. This paper analyses how control over the use of appliances and data security perceptions influence the social acceptance of load-shifting programmes via a social psychological online experiment (N = ) by taking the example of the dishwasher. Results suggest a significant causal influence of the level of control over appliance on the acceptance of a load-shifting programme. In situations where participants perceived a lack of control over their appliance, acceptance levels dropped significantly. Regarding data security, experimental manipulation has been unsuccessful; therefore, no valid conclusions can be drawn regarding this factor. These results indicate the presence of serious concerns regarding the control of appliances when people are asked to consider a load-shifting programme. The development of a deeper understanding of these concerns may help utilities to create more successful, socially accepted load-shifting programmes and communication strategies.","doc_id":16352,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"59","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23048","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Empower the consumer! : energy-related financial literacy and its implications for economic decision making","authors":"Blasch, Julia; Boogen, Nina; Daminato, Claudio; Filippini, Massimo","subject":"Bounded rationality; Counsumer durables; Financial literacy; Energy efficiency; Household decision making;  Finanzwirtschaft;  Energie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"332, 333.79","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Empower the consumer! : energy-related financial literacy and its implications for economic decision making; Bounded rationality; Counsumer durables; Financial literacy; Energy efficiency; Household decision making;  Finanzwirtschaft;  Energie; Untapped energy savings potential in the residential sector might lead to substantial welfare losses.

The experiment tested the influence of  short-term and  long-term decision instruments to encourage the adoption of shared and pooled use of autonomous vehicles, like autonomous taxis and autonomous public transport. Our findings partly support the assumption in the existing literature that vehicles are likely to be used in a pooled mode.

Sexual dysfunction is prevalent during the postpartum period. However, little is known about factors affecting postpartum sexual quality of life and about variations in postpartum sexuality in different cultural contexts.OBJECTIVESTo explore the most important factors related to women’s sexual quality of life during the postpartum period among Iranian and Swiss mothers.METHODSQualitative study using individual interviews and focus group discussions with  Iranian and  Swiss primiparous women at three months after having given birth. We used conventional content analysis and investigated differences between countries.RESULTSCodes were summarised in seven themes: ‘Self-awareness’, ‘Married/partnership life before pregnancy’, ‘Married/partnership life in the context of parenthood’, ‘Sexual worldview’, ‘Sexual performance before giving birth’, ‘Sexual storm after childbirth’ and ‘An earthquake in the life of a mother after childbirth’. Marital life was more important for Iranian than for Swiss women. Additionally, accepting husband’s request despite the lack of readiness was regarded as a positive behaviour of women in Iran but rarely quotedin Switzerland. However, the adaptation of sexual behaviour to the postpartum situation (e.g. sexual position, variety or timing) was relevant aspect for Swiss mothers. Lack of time, a demanding child, tiredness, mood swings but also pain were mentioned in both countries as factors leading to a decreased sexual activity during the postpartum period.CONCLUSIONSThree months after birth, many women did not find back to the same level of sexual activities than before pregnancy.

The proposed method is comprised of different method elements that support the relevant conceptual, organisational, technical, and cultural aspects of the hospital environment.","doc_id":18735,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"43","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8163","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Early versus late admission to labor affects labor progression and risk of cesarean section in nulliparous women","authors":"Mikolajczyk, Rafael T.; Zhang, Jun; Grewal, Jagteshwar; Chan, Linda C.; Petersen, Antje; Gross, Mechthild Maria","subject":"Kaplan-Meier life table analysis; Cesarean section; Dilation; Early admission; Oxytocin; Timing of interventions;  Geburt","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"618.4","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Early versus late admission to labor affects labor progression and risk of cesarean section in nulliparous women; Kaplan-Meier life table analysis; Cesarean section; Dilation; Early admission; Oxytocin; Timing of interventions;  Geburt; Background: Rates of cesarean section increase worldwide, and the components of this increase are partially unknown. A strong role is prescribed to dystocia, and at the same time, the diagnosis of dystocia is highly subjective. Previous studies indicated that risk of cesarean is higher when women are admitted to the hospital early in the labor.Methods: We examined data on , nulliparous women with singleton, vertex pregnancies and spontaneous labor onset. We selected three groups based on cervical dilatation at admission: early (.-. cm, N = ), intermediate (.-. cm, N = ), and late (.-. cm, N = ). The Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to analyze the risk of delivery by cesarean section at a given dilatation, and thin-plate spline regression with a binary outcome (R library gam) to assess the form of the associations between the cesarean section in either the first or second stage versus vaginal delivery and dilatation at admission.Results: Women who were admitted to labor early had a higher risk of delivery by cesarean section ( versus % in the late admission group), while the risk of instrumental delivery did not differ ( versus %). Before  cm dilatation, the earlier a woman was admitted to labor, the higher was her risk of delivery by cesarean section. After  cm dilatation, however, the relationship disappeared. These patterns were true for both first and second stage cesarean deliveries. Oxytocin use was associated with a higher risk of cesarean section only in the middle group (.-. cm dilatation at admission).Conclusion: Early admission to labor was associated with a significantly higher risk of delivery by cesarean section during the first and second stages. Differential effects of oxytocin augmentation depending on dilation at admission may suggest that admission at the early stage of labor is an indicator rather than a risk factor itself, but admission at the intermediate stage (.-. cm) becomes a risk factor itself. Further research is needed to study this hypothesis.","doc_id":18789,"prior":"woman","sdg5":1},{"id":"43","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20550","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Machine learning applications in nonlife insurance","authors":"Grize, Yves-Laurent; Fischer, Wolfram; Lützelschwab, Christian","subject":"Dynamic pricing; Statistics in business and industry; Machine learning; Nonlife insurance; Retention model;  Informatik;  Versicherungen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"004, 332.38","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Machine learning applications in nonlife insurance; Dynamic pricing; Statistics in business and industry; Machine learning; Nonlife insurance; Retention model;  Informatik;  Versicherungen; The literature on analytical applications in insurance tends to be either very general or rather technical, which may hold back the adoption of new important tools by industrial practitioners.

We present two real examples: first a comparison of retention models for household insurance and then a dynamic pricing problem for online motor insurance. Both applications illustrate the advantages but also some of the difficulties of applying ML tools in practice.

We compared the two commonly used sampling methods of yellow pan traps and transect walk to determine (i) which habitat variables affect the species composition, abundance and species richness of sampled bee communities, (ii) which method potentially contains sampling bias towards some individuals or groups of bees and (iii) the efficiency of sampling in various habitats.

We found that Apis mellifera and Bombus spp. were well represented in samples collected by the transect walk method, while the abundance of other genera, especially Dasypoda, Hylaeus and Panurgus was higher in pan traps.

Comment expliquer que parmi les sympathisants de tels courants doctrinaires, certains jeunes prennent part à des attaques violentes? Ces deux questions constituent le fil conducteur de l’étude de Thomas Gabriel, de l’Université de Zurich, consacrée à l’influence du milieu familial et de l’éducation sur l’assimilation de théories d’extrême droite (Familienerziehung und Rechtsextremismus). L’enquête, menée dans le cadre du Programme national de recherche + «Extrémisme de droite – causes et contre-mesures», s’est conclue au printemps dernier. Elle nous livre à présent ses résultats.L’auteur s’est penché sur l’influence de la famille (parents, mais aussi grands-parents) et de personnes de référence significatives de l’environnement social des jeunes sur l’assimilation de discours d’extrême droite et, notamment, sur le développement d’attitudes et de comportements racistes. Il s’agissait en particulier de mettre en lumière des «itinéraires de développement» dans le parcours des jeunes concernés. Un autre axe important des travaux était l’étude des mécanismes de transmission des idéologies xénophobes entre les générations.Au total,  jeunes (six jeunes femmes et  jeunes hommes d’une moyenne d’âge de  ans sympathisant avec des idées politiques d’extrême droite et susceptibles de participer à des actes violents) ont été interrogés sur le climat émotionnel et affectif au sein de la famille, la manière de gérer les conflits, le style d’éducation et la qualité des relations interfamiliales. L’examen de ces divers éléments a permis à l’équipe de chercheurs de reconstituer les processus biographiques de ces jeunes adultes et d’analyser des «charnières» déterminantes dans leur trajet individuel, celles-là mêmes qui les ont conduits à assimiler ce type d’idéologies. A cet égard, il convient de noter que ces «charnières» n’ont pas été seulement mises en évidence par les chercheurs: les jeunes interviewés ont eux aussi qualifié des événements biographiques particuliers comme décisifs dans le développement d’attitudes et de comportements racistes. Près de la moitié des jeunes interrogés étaient membres d’une organisation d’extrême droite (Partei National Orientierter Schweiz [PNOS], Schweizer Nationalisten, Helvetische Jugend, Démocrates Suisses [DS], Blood & Honour, Hammerskins) et environ deux tiers d’entre eux faisaient état de leur appartenance à un groupuscule du type hooligans, skinheads et skingirls. Les auteurs se sont en outre entretenus avec sept couples de parents, des grands-parents et d’autres adultes de référence de l’environnement social et familial des jeunes. Présentation succincte des principaux résultats. On peut affirmer d’emblée que ni les jeunes sondés ni leur famille ne peuvent être considérés comme des «laissés-pour-compte du progrès», («Modernisierungsverlierer») des victimes de l’évolution sociale et économique. Les  cas étudiés  se caractérisent par une grande «normalité» dans les modes et les projets de vie mis en oeuvre. Tant les jeunes que leur famille peuvent être qualifiés de bien intégrés.En revanche, la violence domestique, conjuguée aux conséquences des conflits opposant les parents, joue un rôle majeur dans l’adhésion à des schémas idéologiques d’extrême droite. Les chercheurs ont été surpris de constater qu’un grand nombre de ces jeunes adultes bénéficiaient de mesures d’assistance à la jeunesse. Ainsi, la famille et l’environnement social, de même que la culture et l’histoire individuelles sont autant de facteurs capitaux dans le développement d’attitudes et de comportements racistes. Bien que la prise de contact avec les milieux d’extrême droite soit plutôt le fruit du hasard, l’importance que revêtent ces rencontres pour les jeunes concernés n’a rien d’une coïncidence: elle est en effet déterminée par leur histoire personnelle. Les processus biographiques décrits dans l’étude fournissent de précieux renseignements sur les motifs qui incitent un jeune à faire siennes des idéologies xénophobes ou à participer à des attaques violentes à caractère raciste. Ils permettent également de mieux comprendre pour quelles raisons d’autres jeunes, vivant dans des conditions sociales semblables, ne sont guère sensibles à ce genre de discours. Sur la base des nombreuses données recueillies, les chercheurs distinguent trois types de modèles familiaux et de processus biographiques de nature à favoriser, d’une part, le développement de sympathies pour les milieux d’extrême droite et, d’autre part, la participation à des actes de violence. Les trois schémas directeurs se caractérisent comme suit:– Démarcation via une «suradaptation» – radicalisation des normes et des valeurs transmises par le milieu d’origine– Expression de la violence et du mépris dans la quête de reconnaissance– Absence de considération, recherche d’expériences et d’assurance, volonté d’afficher sa différence.","doc_id":19493,"prior":"violence domestique","sdg5":1},{"id":"27","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23876","date":"2022","language":"en","title":"“I will not put myself above my child” – managing alcohol risk and (re)producing gendered norms of good parenthood during pregnancy","authors":"Radu, Irina; Gouilhers, Solène; Hammer, Raphaël; Meyer, Yvonne; Pehlke-Milde, Jessica","subject":"Alcohol risk; Risk during pregnancy; Good parenthood; Gender norm;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"618","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"“I will not put myself above my child” – managing alcohol risk and (re)producing gendered norms of good parenthood during pregnancy; Alcohol risk; Risk during pregnancy; Good parenthood; Gender norm;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Governmentality principles of risk-aversion and individual responsibility have long permeated the realm of family, framing  good  parenthood as risk-averse parenthood.

The non-apeptide oxytocin (OXT) is involved in adjustment to pregnancy, maternal behavior, and bonding. Our aim was to examine the possible association between plasma OXT during pregnancy and the development of PPD symptoms. A total of  healthy, pregnant women were included in this prospective study. During the third trimester of pregnancy and within  weeks after parturition, PPD symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Blood samples for plasma OXT assessment were collected in the third trimester. Following the literature, participants with postpartum EPDS scores of  or more were regarded as being at risk for PPD development (rPPD group). In a logistic regression analysis, plasma OXT was included as a potential predictor for being at risk for PPD. Results were controlled for prepartal EPDS score, sociodemographic and birth-outcome variables. Plasma OXT concentration in mid-pregnancy significantly predicted PPD symptoms at  weeks postpartum. Compared with the no-risk-for-PPD group, the rPPD group was characterized by lower plasma OXT concentrations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show an association between prepartal plasma OXT concentration and postpartal symptoms of PPD in humans. Assuming a causal relationship, enhancing OXT release during pregnancy could serve as a potential target in prepartum PPD prevention, and help to minimize adverse effects of PPD on the mother-child relationship.","doc_id":19628,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"52","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9938","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Turning sustainability into action : explaining firms' sustainability efforts and their impact on firm performance","authors":"Schrettle, Stefan; Hinz, Andreas; Scherrer-Rathje, Maike; Friedli, Thomas","subject":"Decision-making; Impact; Performance; Knowledge management; Sustainability; Sustainability driver; Aggressiveness; Firm; Green product; Green supply chain management; New manufacturing technology;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Produktionssteuerung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338.927, 658.5","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Turning sustainability into action : explaining firms' sustainability efforts and their impact on firm performance; Decision-making; Impact; Performance; Knowledge management; Sustainability; Sustainability driver; Aggressiveness; Firm; Green product; Green supply chain management; New manufacturing technology;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung;  Produktionssteuerung; This research seeks to shed more light on how manufacturing firms adjust their strategy according to the sustainability challenge.

The experience of other countries shows that this restructuring can influence context factors essential to the delivery of nursing care. As a result, nursing care quality and patient safety may be impacted.Aim: The Sinergia Project aims to develop a monitoring model and related instruments to continuously monitor the impact of DRG-based reimbursement on central nursing service context factors. Method: The descriptive, quantitative results were collected within the framework of a study with a mixed methods design by means of an online survey in which nurses from five hospitals participated.Results: The results show that the nursing service context factors examined (nursing care complexity, quality of the work environment, management, moral distress and job satisfaction), have relevance in all practice areas as regards practice setting and nursing care delivery. Patterns can be recognized that are consistent with those found in the literature and which could be an indication of the relationships between the context factors above, as was hypothesized in the model.Conclusions: The study has provided the participating hospitals with useful data upon which to base discussions on ensuring quality of nursing care and practice development, in addition to information important to the further development of the model and the instruments employed.","doc_id":19789,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21909","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Improving performance and scalability of model-driven generated web applications : an experience report","authors":"Moretti, Gioele; Ruiz, Marcela; Spielberger, Jürgen","subject":" Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Spezielle Computerverfahren","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"005, 006","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Improving performance and scalability of model-driven generated web applications : an experience report;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten;  Spezielle Computerverfahren; Context: Performance and scalability are of critical value for distributed and multiuser systems like web applications.

Results: Knowledge, perceived benefit, and relevance of injury prevention as well as awareness of high risk of injuries in ice hockey were identified as important facilitators. Players’ habit of exercise performance was identified as a barrier. Program understanding of staff members was identified as a facilitator and barrier. No significant relationships were observed between a high/low perceived benefit of an injury prevention program and age (P = .), nationality (P = .), level of education (P = .), National League experience (P = .), or occurrence of lower-extremity injuries in the previous season (P = .).Conclusions: Players and staff members clearly rated perceived benefits of an injury prevention program, which can be considered an important facilitator of the uptake and adoption of such a program in ice hockey teams. Players should be educated about well-performed injury prevention exercises. Staff members should be educated about the aim of a regular injury prevention program. An injury prevention program might be implemented in players of all ages, levels of education, and experience in the National League, irrespective of previous injuries. Identified barriers and facilitators should be addressed when implementing an injury prevention program in a setting of professional ice hockey teams in the future.","doc_id":19952,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"61","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19827","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Exploring the role of positive direct experience in the adoption of energy efficient technologies : evidence from a Swiss field study on the promotion of low-flow showerheads","authors":"Tomic, Uros; Moser, Corinne; Blumer, Yann; Stauffacher, Michael; Seidl, Roman","subject":" Energie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.79","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Exploring the role of positive direct experience in the adoption of energy efficient technologies : evidence from a Swiss field study on the promotion of low-flow showerheads;  Energie; Despite the considerable potential of low-flow showerheads to reduce household energy demand, their widespread implementation is still far from being realised. In this study, we compare the joint effect of a contextually embedded intervention in a public swimming pool to promote low-flow showerheads coupled with a mass campaign by a Swiss city’s utility to the stand-alone effect of the mass campaign. We also explore the factors that influence the outcome of the contextually embedded intervention. The quasi-experimental design of the study was possible due to the co-occurring installation of low-flow showerheads in a local public swimming pool and a campaign of a local utility, which offered low-flow showerheads for domestic use at a substantially reduced price. Our findings showed that the combined intervention was substantially more effective than the mass campaign alone. However, this result has to be interpreted with caution owing to the imperfect comparability of the two campaigns. Based on a survey of  swimming pool visitors, the study findings demonstrate the crucial role of a positive direct experience in the promotion of low-flow showerheads. This had a significant positive impact on attitudes towards low-flow showerheads, which in turn was found to be the most important determinant of purchase intention. The results suggest that more active communication of energy efficiency measures in public facilities might contribute to reductions in household energy use. Such campaigns can be used to share experiences of energy efficiency technologies and, therefore, promote the use of similar systems at home.","doc_id":20032,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"15","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/17200","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"Method for the adoption of information technology governance, risk and compliance in the hospital environment","authors":"Krey, Mike","subject":"Krankenhaus; ITSM; Method enineering; IT GRC;  Informatik;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"004, 362.11","year":"2011","for_data_analysis":"Method for the adoption of information technology governance, risk and compliance in the hospital environment; Krankenhaus; ITSM; Method enineering; IT GRC;  Informatik;  Krankenhäuser und verwandte Einrichtungen","doc_id":20083,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"5","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22447","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Securing the IoT : introducing an evaluation platform for secure elements","authors":"Zimmerli, Lea; Schläpfer, Tobias; Rüst, Andreas","subject":"IoT security; Evaluation platform; Hardware cryptography; Authentication; Tamper proof memory; Secure element; Thread network; Side channel protection; Resource constrained device;  Informatik","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"004","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Securing the IoT : introducing an evaluation platform for secure elements; IoT security; Evaluation platform; Hardware cryptography; Authentication; Tamper proof memory; Secure element; Thread network; Side channel protection; Resource constrained device;  Informatik; Security for resource constrained IoT devices is an important subject. Rising awareness and up-coming regulations will require manufacturers to increase the level of security on their IoT devices. Semiconductor vendors are addressing this demand with dedicated chips, so-called secure elements. Secure elements provide hardware accelerated support for cryptographic operations and tamper proof memory for the secure storage of cryptographically sensitive material. Specifically, they physically isolate sensitive cryptographic material from the application. However, experience from various projects shows, that the selection and the integration of a secure element into a specific application represents a challenge. Accordingly, the paper discusses the development of a multi-vendor evaluation platform. Particularly, the platform, adopting the widespread Arduino shield form factor, features secure elements from five different vendors. Together with the provided integration into Zephyr OS, the board can be easily fitted to various microcontroller development boards. The presented work intends to support developers in the selection process for secure elements and therefore to contribute to their adoption in IoT devices.","doc_id":20266,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"95","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/14630","date":"2019","language":"en","title":"BACKTRAINER : computer-aided therapy system with augmented feedback for the lower back","authors":"Brodbeck, Dominique; Degen, Markus; Stanimirov, Michael; Kool, Jan; Scheermesser, Mandy; Oesch, Peter; Neuhaus, Cornelia","subject":"Computer-aided therapy; Ambient visualization; Back pain; Physiotherapy;  Physiotherapie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"615.82","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"BACKTRAINER : computer-aided therapy system with augmented feedback for the lower back; Computer-aided therapy; Ambient visualization; Back pain; Physiotherapy;  Physiotherapie; Low back pain is an important problem in industrialized countries. Two key factors limit the effectiveness of physiotherapy: low compliance of patients with repetitive movement exercises, and inadequate awareness of patients of their own posture. The Backtrainer system addresses these problems by real-time monitoring of the spine position, by providing a framework for most common physiotherapy exercises for the low back, and by providing feedback to patients in a motivating way. A minimal sensor configuration was identified as two inertial sensors that measure the orientation of the lower back at two points with three degrees of freedom. The software was designed as a flexible platform to experiment with different hardware, and with various feedback modalities. Basic exercises for two types of movements are provided: mobilizing and stabilizing. We developed visual feedback - abstract as well as in the form of a virtual reality game - and complemented the on-screen graphics with an ambient feedback device.

A total of , individuals' data were included. Multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was employed to estimate the probability of very good and good health within the framework of a hierarchical cross-classified age-period-cohort model (HAPC), adjusting for education level, gender, civil status, smoking status and body mass index.Results: Individuals with higher education were substantially more likely than those with primary education to report good SRH (OR = .; % CI = .–. for secondary education and OR = .; % CI = .–. for tertiary education). The education effect depended on birth cohort and age: higher proportions of good SRH were reported by secondary (%–%) and tertiary (%–%) compared with primary educated individuals from the  birth cohort onward; the proportion of secondary/tertiary (compared to primary) educated people reporting good SRH increased with age (by /% at – years and /% at – years). Gender health equality was achieved by the  (primary educated) and  (secondary educated) birth cohorts, while these women overtook men in reporting good SRH from the  birth cohort onward. Tertiary educated younger women were significantly less likely to report good SRH than men but parity was achieved at around pension age. Similarly, gender inequality in those with primary and secondary education reduced in the younger ages to not be significant at around age , with women overtaking men from age .Conclusions: Younger birth cohorts with lower education levels appear most vulnerable in terms of their SRH. The education effect cumulatively increases when attaining incrementally higher education levels. While women report lower health than men, gender inequality in SRH has declined and even reversed over time and is substantially linked to differences in educational status. Swiss public health strategies should particularly target the younger adults with only primary school education of both genders; for women, to combat health burdens in their early life, and men, to mitigate issues in their later life.","doc_id":20370,"prior":"gender inequality","sdg5":1},{"id":"65","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22915","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"'zäme schwanger' : group prenatal care from theory to practice : a programme for midwifery students","authors":"Friedli, Beatrice; Koch, Ramona; Albert, Katherina; Grieder, Sandra; Storni, Virginia Serena","subject":"\"zäme schwanger\"; Centering pregnancy; Group prenatal care; Practical midwifery training;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"618","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"\"zäme schwanger\" : group prenatal care from theory to practice : a programme for midwifery students; \"zäme schwanger\"; Centering pregnancy; Group prenatal care; Practical midwifery training;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; CenteringPregnancy®, a group prenatal care programme which has been successfully established in several countries, has demonstrated positive outcomes such as fewer cases of induced labour and less need for pain medication during childbirth (Rijnders et al., ).

Several studies have established risk factors for postpartum depression, e.g., antenatal depression. However, only a few studies have involved fathers. Moreover, most studies focus on the prevalence of depression instead of intraindividual changes over time. Our study investigated differential effects of parental psychopathology and child difficulty on the course of depressive symptoms and feelings of stress for first-time mothers and fathers. Seventy-four mothers and  fathers completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms (EPDS) and feelings of stress during pregnancy, and at , , , and  months postpartum.

In parents with psychopathology, feelings of stress peaked at  months postpartum. Child difficulty was associated with elevated levels of psychosocial stress, but only for some participants. Parental psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy should thus be considered as a risk factor for elevated and prolonged depression and elevated psychosocial stress in mothers and fathers across the transition to parenthood.","doc_id":20769,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1608","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Automation of 3D cell culture using chemically defined hydrogels","authors":"Rimann, Markus; Graf-Hausner, Ursula; Patocchi-Tenzer, Isabel; Angres, Brigitte; Braum, Susanne","subject":" Biotechnologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660.6","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Automation of D cell culture using chemically defined hydrogels;  Biotechnologie; Drug development relies on high-throughput screening involving cell-based assays.

This study elicited the continuum of care for LBW infants to understand how linkages can be strengthened to optimise quality of care.Methods: This study adopted a constructivist grounded theory design. Data collection took place in a municipality in Ghana between  -  with families, health professionals and managers providing care in clinical and community-based facilities. Audio recorded in-depth interviews were analysed using initial and focused coding, constant comparative analysis, theoretical memos, and diagramming until theoretical sufficiency was determined.Results: Analysis of  interviews generated an interpretive theory showing that referral, discharge, and review processes were not systematically planned and documented. Neonatal care knowledge was lacking due to insufficient investments in coordination and trainings with awareness creation on newborn health thought to reduce misconceptions. Motivated staff, implementation of care guidelines and staff supervision were identified as enabling factors. Mothers lacked financial and practical support and needed assistance in balancing their hope and confidence and empowerment to care for their LBW infants. To overcome these challenges, early bonding and family involvement were helpful.Discussion: A coordinated care process, family, and community involvement through adoption of a family system approach is necessary. Implementing guidelines, providing training opportunities, involving stakeholders, and promoting committed leadership can improve quality in the care continuum.","doc_id":21007,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"57","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3540","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Scaling academic writing instruction : evaluation of a scaffolding tool (Thesis Writer)","authors":"Rapp, Christian; Kauf, Peter Emau","subject":"Computer-supported writing instruction; Writing instruction; Intelligent tutoring system; Academic writing; Evaluation;  Hochschulbildung;  Rhetorik und Schreiben","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"378, 808","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Scaling academic writing instruction : evaluation of a scaffolding tool (Thesis Writer); Computer-supported writing instruction; Writing instruction; Intelligent tutoring system; Academic writing; Evaluation;  Hochschulbildung;  Rhetorik und Schreiben; No thesis - no graduation. Academic writing poses manifold challenges to students, instructors and institutions alike. High labor costs, increasing student numbers, and the Bologna Process (which has reduced the period after which undergraduates in Europe submit their first thesis and thus the time available to focus on writing skills) all pose a threat to students’ academic writing abilities. This situation gave rise to the practical goal of this study: to determine if, and to what extent, academic writing and its instruction can be scaled (i.e., designed more efficiently) using a technological solution, in this case Thesis Writer (TW), a domain-specific, online learning environment for the scaffolding of student academic writing, combined with an online editor optimized for producing academic text. Compared to existing automated essay scoring and writing evaluation tools, TW is not focusing on feedback but on instruction, planning, and genre mastery. While most US-based tools, particularly those also used in secondary education, are targeting on the essay genre, TW is tailored to the needs of theses and research article writing (IMRD scheme).

This is especially important as users of mobile phones can keep connection to several devices simultaneously without interrupting their Internet connection. Compared to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct is more secure, operates at data rates of up to  Mbps, and covers distances up to  meters.

Ample experience has been gained, especially in the U.S., where EEPs have been in use for decades, with the rationale of avoiding additional energy supply by improving energy efficiency. More recently, EEPs have been implemented in Europe and in Switzerland. This review paper presents insights from the U.S., the EU and especially from Switzerland, with a focus on levelised programme cost of saved energy (LPC) as a key performance indicator. These LPC values, which take the perspective of the programme operator, are typically low to very low compared to the cost of electricity supply, thereby representing an important argument in favour of their use. The country examples show that EEPs are being effectively and successfully put into practice, for example, in Switzerland both as (i) a national tender-based scheme (called ProKilowatt) and in the form of a (ii) utility-operated obligation-based scheme (in Geneva). EEPs not only call for diligent implementation but also for suitable legal settings, e.g., in the form of mandatory energy efficiency savings targets (as realised for energy efficiency obligations, EEOs) in combination with programme cost recovery. The main criticism of EEPs is the free-rider effect, which needs to be minimised. On the other hand, EEPs are accompanied by significant co-benefits (environmental, health-related and social) and spillover effects. In their currently prevalent form, EEPs allow one to effectively save energy at a (very) low cost (“low-hanging fruit”). They can hence play an important role in fostering the energy transition; however, they should be implemented as part of a policy portfolio, in combination with other policy instruments.","doc_id":21645,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23881","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Partnerschaftliche Gewalt während der COVID-19-Pandemie in der Schweiz","authors":"Baier, Dirk; Biberstein, Lorenz; Kliem, Sören","subject":"Häusliche Gewalt; Befragung; Partnerschaft; Trendanalyse; Drohung; Domestic violence; Survey; Partnership; Trend analysis; Threat;  Familiensoziologie;  Kriminologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"306.8, 364","year":"2022","for_data_analysis":"Partnerschaftliche Gewalt während der COVID--Pandemie in der Schweiz; Partner violence during the COVID- pandemic in Switzerland; Häusliche Gewalt; Befragung; Partnerschaft; Trendanalyse; Drohung; Domestic violence; Survey; Partnership; Trend analysis; Threat;  Familiensoziologie;  Kriminologie; Der Beitrag berichtet Ergebnisse zu  schweizweit repräsentativen Befragungsstudien.

There were no statistically significant differences in the MGI scores between the German and the Swiss women (p = .). Significantly more favourable MGI scores were found associated with more adequate information during pregnancy (p = .), a more satisfactory birth experience (p < .), epidural anaesthesia (p < .), more information (p = .) and better support (p = .) during the time in hospital and less disturbed sleep (p < .). Significantly lower MGI scores were associated with the presence of a private doctor during birth (p = .) and with exclusive breastfeeding during the first postnatal days (p = .).Conclusion: The MGI scores of these German-speaking women were higher than those in other studies reported previously. Thus the tool may be able to detect differences in postnatal quality of life among women with substantially divergent cultural backgrounds. Shortcomings in maternity and midwifery care were detected, as for example the inadequate provision of information during pregnancy, a lack of individualised postpartum care during the hospital stay and insufficient support for exclusively breastfeeding mothers. The MGI is an appropriate instrument for maternity care outcome measurement in cross-cultural comparison research.","doc_id":21726,"prior":"pregnancy","sdg5":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13193","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Public sector accounting reforms and the impact of the IPSASs","authors":"Fuchs, Sandro","subject":" Öffentliche Verwaltung;  Rechnungswesen","type":"Dissertation","bid":"350, 657","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Public sector accounting reforms and the impact of the IPSASs;  Öffentliche Verwaltung;  Rechnungswesen; This thesis is an attempt to provide academically supported answers to practically important questions and aims to capture qualitative benefits of IPSASs-like reforms. In a first and second instance, it concentrates on IPSASs implementation effects in Switzerland. The research focus pertains to Swiss states which have been currently undertaken by IPSASs-like reforms. In a third and fourth instance, the thesis examines the international adoption of the IPSASs, with the research focus being UN System Organizations and selected OECD member countries.This thesis is split into three sections. While Section  introduces the overall topic of the thesis and outlines the structure, Section  puts the thesis in a theoretical framework. Section  also outlines and presents the global spread of IPSASs adoption and identifies a need to further elaborate IPSASs implementation effects. In essence, it states four major research objectives which all address fundamental research questions dedicated to better understanding IPSASs implementation. The third section presents four chapters pertaining to meet the stated research objectives.In summary, this thesis found supportive empirical arguments in favor of IPSASs adoption. We found evidence that the IPSASs bear the capacity to develop and shape decision-making processes and that it has positive effects on accountability and transparency. Furthermore, there is evidence that the IPSASs have the ability to raise management debates about core revenue streams, particularly in the context of UN System Organizations.Together with these findings, the thesis provides additional information for practitioners, specifically government officials, public financial management experts and international consultants concerned about the impact of the IPSASs. However, it is worth emphasizing that this dissertation does not aim to convince any IPSASs-pessimistic exponent to begin or proceed with IPSASs-style reforms. Although academic literature in general – and this thesis in specific – finds supportive arguments in favor of implementing IPSASs, critical counterarguments remain.","doc_id":21735,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/13167","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A flexible object model and algebra for uniform access to object databases","authors":"Grossniklaus, Michael; de Spindler, Alexandre; Zimmerli, Christoph; Norrie, Moira C.","subject":"Object database; Object algebra; Object model;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"005","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"A flexible object model and algebra for uniform access to object databases; Object database; Object algebra; Object model;  Computerprogrammierung, Programme und Daten; In contrast to their relational counterparts, object databases are more heterogeneous in terms of their architecture, data model and functionality.

Folic acid supplements are recommended  weeks before and during early pregnancy to significantly reduce risk of neural tube defects and other congenital defects. Yet many young women are unaware or not following this international recommendation. As in Europe, Switzerland does not have mandatory folic acid fortification, therefore prevention is under individual responsibility.

These endeavors make hospitals to enhance and integrate concepts of Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM). This work proposes a novel method for the introduction of mobile strategies with respect to closely-meshed organizational and social structures within hospitals. One key contribution of this method is its hybrid approach to combine collective know-how of existing EMM frameworks with an iterative process model approach. The application of this EMM framework under real-world conditions within different Swiss hospitals has led to a positive outcome whereby all hospitals concurred that the method allows for the adoption of EMM principles while taking into consideration the individual styles and patterns of behavior.","doc_id":23283,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23686","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Surgical interventions for women with female genital mutilation/cutting : A) How successful are the most common types of surgical interventions for FGM/C available in industrialized countries, and B) which factors influence whether the results are considered satisfactory by the women receiving them?","authors":"Macher, Luna; Raoult, Milena","subject":"FGM/C; Guidelines; Midwife; Therapy; Surgical intervention;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"618","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Surgical interventions for women with female genital mutilation/cutting : A) How successful are the most common types of surgical interventions for FGM/C available in industrialized countries, and B) which factors influence whether the results are considered satisfactory by the women receiving them?; FGM/C; Guidelines; Midwife; Therapy; Surgical intervention;  Geburtsmedizin und Hebammenarbeit; Female genital mutilation and/or cutting (FGM/C) is classified into four types and leads to various health consequences for girls and women.

These companies are generally expected to be amongst the primary consumers of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. So far, however, fossil fuel companies have shown only moderate interest in CCS. Whilst a lot of potential operational barriers to CCS adoption have been identified in the literature, the value of CCS from a corporate strategy perspective has sometimes been assumed, but rarely explored. This paper asks the following question: What are the perceptions and positions of fossil fuel companies on CCS and how does this inform their decision-making on CCS investment and advocacy? This paper addresses this issue by presenting the results of in-depth interviews with high-level CCS experts from major multinational oil and gas companies and major coal mining firms. The results indicate that CCS would require a significant change within the business strategy of fossil fuel companies. This is contrary to the common argument that CCS is attractive because the technology is regarded as not being very disruptive to the incumbent energy system as it leaves most of the existing infrastructure, actor constellations and institutions intact. While fossil fuel companies engage in CCS development, it is often to familiarise themselves with technologies that might have future value if markets for these technologies take off. In several cases, CCS engagement has served the strategic need to weaken the link between fossil fuel extraction and climate change, build up shareholder trust, and improve public perception. However, there is little evidence that these companies engage in CCS to develop a strategic insurance against climate policy risks to their core businesses.","doc_id":23332,"prior":"adoption","sdg5":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21090","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Inadequate status and low awareness of folate in Switzerland : a call to strengthen public health measures to ensure sufficient intakes","authors":"Herter-Aeberli, Isabelle; Wehrli, Nina; Bärlocher, Kurt; Andersson, Maria; Sych, Janice Marie","subject":"Folate awareness; Folate status; Folic acid; Neural tube defect; Pregnancy; Women;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"613.2, 614","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Inadequate status and low awareness of folate in Switzerland : a call to strengthen public health measures to ensure sufficient intakes; Folate awareness; Folate status; Folic acid; Neural tube defect; Pregnancy; Women;  Diätetik;  Public Health und Gesundheitsförderung; This publication is connected to the project Folic Acid Awareness in Switzerland.; Background: Folate plays an essential role in the prevention of neural tube defects, yet little is known about the folate status of women of reproductive age or to what degree the general population is aware of the importance of folate in early-life development.
