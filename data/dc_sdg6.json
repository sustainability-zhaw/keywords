Denn durch die lang-same Wiederbewachsung von offenen Bodenstellen können sich kleine Erosionsflächen rasch zu grossflächigen ausweiten und langfristig zur Bodendegradation führen. Für die Schweiz existiert für das Dauer-grünland bis in die Bergzone  eine Erosionsrisikokarte mit einer Auflösung von  m. Um für kleine Flächen gezielte Erosionsschutzmassnahmen ergreifen zu können, ist diese Karte nur beschränkt geeignet. Deshalb wurden im Rahmen dieser Bachelorarbeit eine detaillierte Erosionshinweiskarte für das Gebiet oberhalb von Ardez im Kanton Graubünden mit einer Auflösung von . m ausgearbeitet, welche kleinräumig stark gefährdete Erosionsflächen ausweist und einen zusätzlichen Faktor für flachgründige Rutschungen einbindet. Aufbauend auf dem bestehenden Ansatz der Erosionsrisikokarte für das Dauergrünland der Schweiz wurde zusätzlich der K-Faktor mit einer höheren Auflösung von  m modelliert und durch Literaturrecherchen über das Senkrecht-Wurzelmodell ein Rutschungsfaktor abgeleitet. Das Resultat dieser Bachelorarbeit sind hoch aufgelöste Erosionshinweiskarten für das Untersuchungsgebiet bei Ardez und ein aussagekräftiges, auf luftbildgestützten Verfahren basierendes Tool, das insbesondere für das Dauergrünland im Sömmerungs-perimeter eine Bestimmung von stark gefährdete Erosionsflächen von <. m zulässt. Da diese vermutlich vorwiegend auf Trittschäden durch Beweidung zurückzuführen sind, ist es mit wenig Aufwand möglich, bei Feldbegehungen gezielte, präventive Erosionsschutzmassnahmen zu ergreifen, bevor die Schäden sich grossflächig ausbreiten können. Diese Erosionshinweiskarten auf die ganze Schweiz auszuweiten, ist durch die gewählte Auflösung von . m und der daraus resultierenden Datenverarbeitungsmenge kaum umsetzbar noch sinnvoll. Daher sollten nur Gebiete mit einem hohen Erosionsrisiko mit dieser Auflösung untersucht werden. Diese Hotspots können mit der bestehenden Erosionsrisikokarte für das Dauergrünland in der Schweiz lokalisiert werden, um für sie dann mit dem erarbeiteten Tool hochauflösende Erosionshinweiskarten zu erstellen.Soil erosion in the Alpine region is a current and serious problem. Through the slow re-growth of open soil areas, small erosion areas can easily expand rapidly into large areas and lead to soil degradation in the long term. In Switzerland, an erosion risk map with a resolution of  m exists for permanent grassland up to mountain zone . This map is only of limited use for taking specific erosion control measures for a small area. For this reason, detailed erosion risk maps with a resolution of . m have been developed for the area above Ardez in the canton of Graubünden. These maps identify small-scale erosion risk areas at high risk and include an additional factor for shallow landslides. Based on the existing approach of the erosion risk map for permanent grassland in Switzerland, the K-factor was additionally modelled with a higher resolution of  m and a landslide factor was derived by literature research using the vertical root model. The results of this bachelor thesis are high-resolution erosion indication maps for the study area close to Ardez and a meaningful tool based on aerial photography techniques. Especially for the permanent grassland in summer-time perimeters, this tool allows an identification of highly endangered erosion areas of <. m. Since these are probably caused by treading damage caused through grazing, it is possible with little effort to take specific, preventive erosion control measures during field inspections before the damage can spread over a large area. Due to the chosen resolution of . m and the resulting data processing volume, it is hardly practicable to extend the erosion indication map to the whole of Switzerland. Therefore, only areas with a high risk of erosion should be investigated with this resolution. These hotspots could be localized using the existing erosion risk map for permanent grassland in Switzerland, and then high-resolution erosion indication maps could be created for these areas using the developed tool.","doc_id":932,"prior":"erosion control","sdg6":1},{"id":"25","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2517","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Potential of algae turf scrubbers (ATS™) for elimination of phosphorus from swimming ponds","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Leiblein, Thomas; Refardt, Dominik; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Phosphorous; Swimming pond; ATS; Concentration;  Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"577","year":"2013","for_data_analysis":"Potential of algae turf scrubbers (ATS™) for elimination of phosphorus from swimming ponds; Phosphorous; Swimming pond; ATS; Concentration;  Ökologie; Algal Turf Scrubbers (ATS) are water treatment devices that use light and nutrients in the (waste)water to grow periphyton community; undesirable chemicals are removed by physical, chemical and biological processes.

Besides treating the effluent (total organic carbon [TOC], total nitrogen, nitrate [NO-N], ammonium [NH-N], and total phosphorus concentrations being  g/m,  g/m,  g/m,  g/m, and  g/m, respectively) according to Swiss law requirements, the research focused on the search for suitable aquatic organisms and their testing at different environmental conditions. During the -week experimental period, a total of , kg fresh weight (FW) ofbiomass (% as floatingmacrophytes) was harvested. This way,  g/week nitrogen and  g/week phosphorus were eliminated by assimilation, corresponding to -% of the system's inflow. Due to relatively high evapotranspiration rates (on average . mm/week) and for water reconditioning purpose in the fish stocking basins, fresh water was added. Nevertheless, the system's final effluent was very low (% of total inflow plus rainfall) and was carrying only about % and .% of the input loads of nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. Hence, the elimination rate was significantly above the average performance of a conventional system normally applied in Middle Europe, although the concentration values of most parameters in the outflow were comparable. Macrophyte production (and thus nutrient assimilation) was close to theoretical maxima in basins with high nutrient levels. Both plankton and fish growth were, at their best, only moderately satisfying. The semi-continual planktonic microalgae culture, and therefore also zooplankton culture, could be improved if the light absorbing humic substances were removed in a pre-treatment. Under given conditions (i.e., temperate climate) fish would rather play an accompanying role in the ecological production process. A wastewater-fed aquaculture facility resembles an integrated production plant rather than a wastewater disposal site. In addition to that, it has potential to prove advantageous over the highly developed conventional wastewater treatment plants established in Middle Europe. Further research in this field is essential and also recommended, considering political programs like Agenda , which contemplate the need for sustainable strategies for handling resources.","doc_id":1306,"prior":"wastewater treatment","sdg6":1},{"id":"12","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/8248","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Measuring sediment fluxes in periglacial reservoirs using water samples, LISST and ADCP","authors":"Ehrbar, D.; Schmocker, L.; Vetsch, D.F.; Boes, R.M.; Döring, Michael","subject":"ADP; Sediment; Hydropower;  Geologie und Hydrologie;  Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"551, 577","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Measuring sediment fluxes in periglacial reservoirs using water samples, LISST and ADCP; ADP; Sediment; Hydropower;  Geologie und Hydrologie;  Ökologie; Climate change offers new perspectives for reservoirs near to the glacial environment.

To investigate how species richness and vegetation composition had changed during these  years, we resampled  permanently marked nested-plot series ( m²,  m² and  m²). Using paired t-tests, we analysed changes in biodiversity metrics and mean ecological indicator values and related the quantified changes to poten-tial explanatory variables via linear regressions. Using the z-values from the power law species-area relationships, we analysed potential changes in beta diversity. Both species richness and herb layer cover significantly decreased from  to  across the three grain sizes. The z-values for the transi-tion from  m² to  m² were significantly higher in . The mean light value in the -m plots in  was also significantly lower than in . Species richness, Shannon diversity and Shannon evenness decreased with increasing tree layer cover. With increasing herb layer cover, species richness increased in the -m plots and the relative species loss decreased in the -m and -m plots. The relationship between species loss and increased canopy cover confirmed that light availability acts as an important driver for species richness. Whether the loss in both herb cover and species is also related to recent summer drought events such as  can only be clarified through further resurveys. Decreases in z-values indicate lower beta diversity and more homogenous vegetation in . The decrease in species richness was more pronounced in the -m plots than in the smaller plots. In some cases, explanatory variables had an effect on the change in species diversity only in the -m² and -m² plots, but not in the -m² plots, indicating that other drivers prevail. The change in species diversity and the influencing factors were clearly scale dependent. Further investigation is required to determine whether our findings are merely region-specific or also valid in other biogeographical regions. To ensure that further species loss does not go unnoticed, we recommend the continuation of coordinated resurvey studies and monitoring.","doc_id":1594,"prior":"drought","sdg6":1},{"id":"69","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2167","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"OXISCREEN – Wirkungsbezogene Analytik : zur Detektion von Reaktionsprodukten bei der Trinkwasseraufbereitung mit O3, O3/H2O2 und CL2/CLO2","authors":"Köster, Oliver; Schubert-Ulrich, Patricia; Schönborn, Andreas; Schulz, Wolfgang","subject":"Mikroschadstoffe; Trinkwasser; Oxidationsmittel; Stoffgemische;  Ökologie;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"577, 620","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"OXISCREEN – Wirkungsbezogene Analytik : zur Detektion von Reaktionsprodukten bei der Trinkwasseraufbereitung mit O, O/HO und CL/CLO; Mikroschadstoffe; Trinkwasser; Oxidationsmittel; Stoffgemische;  Ökologie;  Ingenieurwesen; Die Wasserversorger müssen den Nachweis erbringen, dass Kontaminationen wie pathogene Mikroorganismen, Toxine, Spurenstoffe und endokrine Disruptoren effektiv entfernt, zerstört oder inaktiviert werden und dass die bei ihren Aufbereitungsverfahren entstehenden Reaktionsprodukte gesundheitlich unbedenklich sind.

Most significant consequences of this are changes to flow regimes as well as the transformation of permanent into temporary waterways. This is problematic, as despite their role in supporting biodiversity and ecosystem processes, temporary waterways are undervalued and poorly understood. In fact, although the effects of non-flow periods are known, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how changes in frequency and duration of non-flow periods influence temporary waterways. Therefore, the goal of further research is to extend the current knowledge surrounding the effects of temporal components on the aquatic ecosystem. This bachelor thesis aims to identify how the frequency of non-flow periods affects autotrophic and heterotrophic stream biofilm. With this objective, an experiment at the Experimental Stream Facility of Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA) was performed. The treatments consisted of one drought duration ( days) and three frequencies ( period of ,  periods of ,  periods of  non-flow days). The development of the autotrophic and heterotrophic stream biofilm was measured during flow periods by means of yield of photochemistry, aerobic respiration, ecosystem metabolism and ash free dry mass. The hypotheses were that with increasing frequency, the effects on stream biofilm are less because the number of subsequent non-flow days is smaller and thus the biofilm is less stressed, and that autotrophs in the epipsammic biofilm recover more slowly than in the epilithic biofilm, because the amount of water retained in sand is higher. Both hypotheses were partially confirmed, as an increasing frequency only lessened the effect on epipsammic biofilm and only autotrophic function recovered more slowly in sand than on cobbles.

In this regard, Gleditsia triacanthos and Salix alba despite their affiliation to the riparian trees, exhibit species-specific responses to drought and heat. While Gleditsia triacanthos shows a high sensitivity to atmospheric drought and strongly regulates water consumption, Salix alba maintains its stomatal conductance even under drying conditions. Thus, despite a larger transpiring leaf area Gleditsia triacanthos has a lower sap flow rate than Salix alba.

Nevertheless, the non-significant temperature differences can be attributed to initial shading effects of the trees as well as the lower surface temperature of the vegetative structures. The ability to limit its own water consumption protects Gleditsia triacanthos from loss of vitality, but results in lower cooling effects. Therefore, Gleditsia triacanthos can be recommended for strongly sun-exposed sites with less water availability.

Das Wasser, welches im Boden in Grob und Feinporen vorliegt, dient als Lösungsmittel und Transportmedium für Nährstoffe und wird beim Gasaustausch mit der Atmosphäre transpiriert. So verändert sich der im Boden befindende Bodenwasservorrat ständig, abhängig von Niederschlägen, Transpiration und Evaporation. Die Quantifizierung des Bodenwasservorrats ist für die Landwirtschaft wichtig, weil es Hinweise zur mengenmassigen und zeitlichen Bemessung von Bewässerungsgaben liefert.Da die flachendeckende Messung von Bodenwassergehalt und Matrixpotenzial teuer und arbeitsaufwändig ist, kann mithilfe von Modellen die Bodenwasserbilanz eines Standorts berechnet werden. Dabei werden Daten zu Meteorologie und Bodenbeschaffenheit verwendet, um die Evapotranspiration (ET), Infiltration und Versickerung mathematisch zu beziffern. In dieser Arbeit sollen Berechnungen der Wasserbilanz sowie des Bodenwassergehalts vorgenommen und mit Messdaten der Lysimeteranlage auf dem Campus der ZHAW in Wädenswil verglichen werden. Da die Exposition und Hangneigung aufgrund des sich verändernden Einstrahlungswinkels einen Einfluss auf die Evapotranspiration hat, wurden zudem Tensiometer zur Überwachung der Bodenfeuchtigkeit an zwei unterschiedlich exponierten Flachen installiert, um diesen Effekt zu beobachten.Die mit HYDRUS-D berechneten Komponenten der Wasserbilanz sowie Bodenwassergehalt und Matrixpotenzial zeigten eine gute Übereinstimmung mit den gemessenen Daten. Sickerwassermenge und Speicheränderung konnten gut nachvollzogen werden. Die Berechnung der ET wies jedoch Unstimmigkeiten auf, die teilweise durch die verwendeten Eingangs-Parameter erklärt werden konnten. Die Berechnungen des Matrixpotenzials in Abhängigkeit der expositionsabhängigen Einstrahlung konnte nur bedingt die gemessenen Werte abbilden. Im Unterboden wurde dabei eine bessere Übereinstimmung als im Oberboden erreicht. Die Genauigkeit des Modells konnte durch die Verwendung genauerer Daten über Boden und Vegetation verbessert werden.; Abstract:Soils form an important intermediate reservoir in the water cycle. The water, which is present in the soils coarse and fine pores, serves as a solvent and transport medium for nutrients and is transpired during gas exchange with the atmosphere. The soil water supply changes constantly depending on precipitation, transpiration and evaporation. Quantifying the soil water provides information on the quantity and timing of irrigation for agricultural crops.Since the large-scale measurement of soil water content and matrix potential is expensive and labourintensive, models can be used to calculate the soil water balance of a site. Data on meteorology and soil composition are used to mathematically quantify evapotranspiration, infiltration and percolation. In this work, calculations of the water balance and the soil water content will be carried out and compared with measured data from the lysimeter facility on the campus of the ZHAW in Wadenswil. Since exposition and slope have an influence on evapotranspiration due to the changing irradiation angle, tensiometers for monitoring soil moisture were also installed on two differently exposed surfaces to observe this effect.The components of the water balance, soil water content and matrix potential calculated by HYDRUS-D showed a good agreement with the measured data. The quantity of percolated and the change in stored water could be reproduced. However, the calculation of the evapotranspiration showed discrepancies, which could partly be explained by the input parameters used. The calculations of the matrix potential as a function of the exposure-dependent irradiation could only reproduce the measured values to a limited extent. A better agreement was achieved in the subsoil than in the topsoil. The performance of the model could be improved by using more accurate data regarding soil and vegetation cover.","doc_id":3157,"prior":"water supply","sdg6":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19403","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"A novel proposition for a citrate-modified photo-Fenton process against bacterial contamination of microalgae cultures","authors":"Pulgarin, Adrian; Giannakis, Stefanos; Pulgarin, César; Ludwig, Christian; Refardt, Dominik","subject":"Microalgae cultivation; Contamination; Photo-Fenton; Disinfection;  Biologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"570","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"A novel proposition for a citrate-modified photo-Fenton process against bacterial contamination of microalgae cultures; Microalgae cultivation; Contamination; Photo-Fenton; Disinfection;  Biologie; This study reports the first attempt of a citrate-modified photo-Fenton (PF) application at near-neutral pH (. to ., tap water) to disinfect Escherichia coli (as model bacterium), in Chlorella vulgaris cultures.

Citric acid also considerably increased the lifetime of dissolved iron and prevented aggregation of microalgae, which was caused by Fe+ addition. While these aggregates do not impact the already short lifetime of dissolved iron, they impede the citrate-favored homogeneous process that mainly inactivates E. coli. Finally, an integrated mechanism for C. vulgaris inactivation is suggested and compared with the one of E. coli.","doc_id":3216,"prior":"tap water","sdg6":1},{"id":"100","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19831","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Implementing nature-based solutions for creating a resourceful circular city","authors":"Langergraber, Guenter; Pucher, Bernhard; Simperler, Lena; Kisser, Johannes; Katsou, Evina; Bühler, Devi; Mateo, Mari Carmen Garcia; Atanasova, Nataša","subject":"Blue-Green Infrastructure; Circular Economy; Nature-Based Solutions; Resourceful Cities;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"338.927","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Implementing nature-based solutions for creating a resourceful circular city; Blue-Green Infrastructure; Circular Economy; Nature-Based Solutions; Resourceful Cities;  Umweltökonomie und nachhaltige Entwicklung; Resource depletion, climate change and degradation of ecosystems are challenges faced by cities worldwide and will increase if cities do not adapt. In order to tackle those challenges, it is necessary to transform our cities into sustainable systems using a holistic approach. One element in achieving this transition is the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS). NBS can provide a range of ecosystem services beneficial for the urban biosphere such as regulation of micro-climates, flood prevention, water treatment, food provision and more. However, most NBS are implemented serving only one single purpose. Adopting the concept of circular economy by combining different types of services and returning resources to the city, would increase the benefits gained for urban areas. The COST Action Circular City aims to establish a network testing the hypothesis that: ‘A circular flow system that implements NBS for managing nutrients and resources within the urban biosphere will lead to a resilient, sustainable and healthy urban environment’. In this paper we introduce the COST Action Circular City by describing its main objectives and aims. The paper also serves as introduction to the review papers of the Action's five Working Groups in this Special Issue.","doc_id":3454,"prior":"water treatment","sdg6":1},{"id":"48","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20800","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Determination of habitat requirements of the glacial relict Nuphar pumila as basis for successful (re-)introductions","authors":"Keller, Sabrina; Babbi, Manuel; Widmer, Stefan; Gehler, Jamyra; Hausmann, Sonja; Berg, Christian; Landucci, Flavia; Schwager, Patrick; Sumberova, Katerina; Dengler, Jürgen","subject":" Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik)","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 580","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Determination of habitat requirements of the glacial relict Nuphar pumila as basis for successful (re-)introductions;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Pflanzen (Botanik); Nuphar pumila is a glacial relict, which is nowadays rare throughout Europe and red-listed in most European regions.

In this modeling study, we aim at increasing the efficiency of air-source heat pumps using domestic greywater-contained heat.

The results show that the annually-averaged coefficient of performance improves by .% on average – ranging from .% to .%.

Although attractive due to its simplicity, the proposed open-loop configuration – preheating of an external heat source – only leads to moderate performance improvement of air-source heat pumps. Based on these results, we extensively discuss and compare alternative system configurations and identify several fundamental differences in the heat recovery dynamics of each configuration.

For the recovery of plant nutrients and production of climate-neutral fuel from wet waste streams, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has been suggested as a promising technology. In this study, digested sewage sludge (DSS) was used as waste material for phosphorus and nitrogen recovery. HTC was conducted at  °C for  h, followed by phosphorus stripping (PS) or leaching (PL) at room temperature. The results showed that for PS and PL around % and % of phosphorus, as well as % and % of nitrogen, respectively, could be recovered in the liquid phase (process water and/or extract). Heavy metals were mainly transferred to the hydrochar and only < ppm of Cd and – ppm of Zn were found to be in the liquid phase of the acid treatments.

For the recovery of plant nutrients and production of climate-neutral fuel from wet waste streams, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has been suggested as a promising technology. In this study, digested sewage sludge (DSS) was used as waste material for phosphorus and nitrogen recovery. HTC was conducted at  °C for  h, followed by phosphorus stripping (PS) or leaching (PL) at room temperature. The results showed that for PS and PL around % and % of phosphorus, as well as % and % of nitrogen, respectively, could be recovered in the liquid phase (process water and/or extract).

We used a case study in the Swiss Alps (hydropower company Kraftwerke Oberhasli AG) to develop an efficient and successful procedure for the ecological evaluation of such impacts, and to predict the effects of possible mitigation measures. We evaluated the following scenarios using  biotic and abiotic indicators: the pre-mitigation scenario (i.e. current state), the future scenario with increased turbine capacity but without mitigation measures, and future scenarios with increased turbine capacity and four alternative mitigation measures. The evaluation was based on representative hydrographs and quantitative or qualitative prediction of the indicators. Despite uncertainties in the ecological responses and the future operation mode of the hydropower plant, the procedure allowed the most appropriate mitigation measure to be identified. This measure combines a basin and a cavern at a total retention volume of ,m, allowing for substantial dampening in the flow falling and ramping rates and in turn considerable reduction in stranding risk for juvenile trout and in macroinvertebrate drift. In general, this retention volume had the greatest predicted ecological benefit and can also, to some extent, compensate for possible modifications in the hydropower operation regime in the future, e.g. due to climate change, changes in the energy market, and changes in river morphology. Furthermore, it also allows for more specific seasonal regulations of retention volume during ecologically sensitive periods (e.g. fish spawning seasons). Overall experience gained from our case study is expected to support other hydropeaking mitigation projects.","doc_id":4896,"prior":"river ecosystems","sdg6":1},{"id":"46","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22143","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"A green wall system for laundry greywater treatment","authors":"Antenen, Nadine; Mežek, Katjuša; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Vertical greening; Green wall; Greywater recycling;  Ingenieurwesen","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"620","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"A green wall system for laundry greywater treatment; Vertical greening; Green wall; Greywater recycling;  Ingenieurwesen","doc_id":5012,"prior":"greywater","sdg6":1},{"id":"72","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/5532","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Legionella in FM : Detection of Legionella pneumophila in waterlines of dental surgeries in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland","authors":"Leiblein, Thomas; Kroslakova, Ivana; Freimüller Leischtfeld, Susette; Fieseler, Lars; Hofer, Susanne","subject":"Legionella;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Facility Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"610, 658.2","year":"2015","for_data_analysis":"Legionella in FM : Detection of Legionella pneumophila in waterlines of dental surgeries in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland; Legionella;  Medizin und Gesundheit;  Facility Management; Facility management (FM) is present in healthcare. According to the International Facility Management Association (IFMA) guidelines, an organisation is obliged to take precautions to enable continuous business operation and reduce hazards. As FM organizations or facilities services are sometimes responsible for water systems, and hence in the reduction of hazards in this area, the FM’s role is vital for maintaining hygiene. Being healthcare providers, dental surgeries are subject to strict hygienic criteria. During treatment patients are consigned to the care of dentists. The instruments of a dental chair unit (DCU) operate with drinking water from a source. In the process of an implemented hygienic concept in the dental surgeries the care instruments get disinfected systematically. But the water system of the building itself allows limited access, and its hygienic status is not always documented well. As can be seen by this example, hygiene concepts potentially contain blind spots. As a result, not only patients but also medical staff might be exposed to hygienic hazards, which are meant to be reduced to a minimum. Contaminated water lines may cause certain diseases (e.g. Legionnaire’s Disease). Inevitably, the personnel responsible have to manage the facilities appropriately to reduce the risks of a contamination. Literature on Legionella suggests an urgent need to address the issue of Legionella in dental surgeries. This paper will highlight the issue of Legionella in dental surgeries and aims to detect potential hazards from the built environments’ hygiene with a focus on water lines. It will further draw attention to additional criteria relevant for FM and duty holders. During the case study, data was collected on Legionella contamination in dental surgeries' waterlines. Building and water lines of the DCUs were tested as well, in compliance with the Swiss drinking water ordinance. Appreciating the fact, that there was no pathogen Legionella pneumophila detected in all samples of the DCUs, the questions arises on the incident of a potential contamination of the facilities (building) water line system itself as well as on the duties of the stakeholders involved.","doc_id":5411,"prior":"drinking water","sdg6":1},{"id":"31","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6662","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"A conceptual framework for hydropeaking mitigation","authors":"Bruder, Andreas; Tonolla, Diego; Schweizer, Steffen P.; Vollenweider, Stefan; Langhans, Simone D.; Wüest, Alfred","subject":"Discharge fluctuation; Ecological indicator; Functional indicator; Hydroelectricity; Prediction tool; River restoration;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"A conceptual framework for hydropeaking mitigation; Discharge fluctuation; Ecological indicator; Functional indicator; Hydroelectricity; Prediction tool; River restoration;  Ökologie; Hydropower plants are an important source of renewable energy. In the near future, high-head storage hydropower plants will gain further importance as a key element of large-scale electricity production systems. However, these power plants can cause hydropeaking which is characterized by intense unnatural discharge fluctuations in downstream river reaches. Consequences on environmental conditions in these sections are diverse and include changes to the hydrology, hydraulics and sediment regime on very short time scales. These altered conditions affect river ecosystems and biota, for instance due to drift and stranding of fishes and invertebrates. Several structural and operational measures exist to mitigate hydropeaking and the adverse effects on ecosystems, but estimating and predicting their ecological benefit remains challenging. We developed a conceptual framework to support the ecological evaluation of hydropeaking mitigation measures based on current mitigation projects in Switzerland and the scientific literature. We refined this framework with an international panel of hydropeaking experts. The framework is based on a set of indicators, which covers all hydrological phases of hydropeaking and the most important affected abiotic and biotic processes. Effects of mitigation measures on these indicators can be predicted quantitatively using prediction tools such as discharge scenarios and numerical habitat models. Our framework allows a comparison of hydropeaking effects among alternative mitigation measures, to the pre-mitigation situation, and to reference river sections. We further identified key issues that should be addressed to increase the efficiency of current and future projects. They include the spatial and temporal context of mitigation projects, the interactions of river morphology with hydropeaking effects, and the role of appropriate monitoring to evaluate the success of mitigation projects.","doc_id":5565,"prior":"river ecosystems","sdg6":1},{"id":"10","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10846","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Assessment of cleantech options to mitigate the environmental impact of South African dairy and maize farming","authors":"Keller, Regula; Eymann, Lea; Wettstein, Sarah; Steinegger, Tobias; von Blottnitz, Harro; Scharfy, Deborah; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Dairy; SAFARI; LCA; Maize; Cleantech; Variable speed driver; Enteric methane emissions; Photovoltaics; South Africa;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333, 630","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Assessment of cleantech options to mitigate the environmental impact of South African dairy and maize farming; Dairy; SAFARI; LCA; Maize; Cleantech; Variable speed driver; Enteric methane emissions; Photovoltaics; South Africa;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Landwirtschaft; Oral presentation; Introduction: Agriculture accounts for about  % of national greenhouse gas emissions in South Africa in . Food value chains, both primary production and downstream processing, have been identified as one of the priority areas to reduce environmental impacts of food production. The implementation of clean technologies, which are customised to South African food value chains and help to mitigate these impacts, are therefore crucial.Goal and Scope: In order to make science-based decisions about the implementation of clean technologies, the project “Applying Life Cycle Assessment for the mitigation of environmental impacts of South African agri-food products” aimed at quantifying environmental mitigation potentials when applying clean technologies. The environmental impact of technologies currently applied at South African dairy and arable farms was analysed for environmental hotspots. Based on this data, the effect of applying the following mitigation options were analysed: () Milk production: Adding the methane inhibitor -nitrooxypropanol (NOP) to the feed of lactating Holstein cows. () Maize production I: The use of variable frequency drive in centre-pivot irrigation of maize. () Maize production II: Provision of electricity for pumping irrigation water directly by solar panels.The following nine environmental impact categories were analysed: global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (non-renewable: fossil and nuclear), eutrophication (freshwater and marine), human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer effects), freshwater ecotoxicity and land use.Results: Firstly, adding NOP to the feed of cows decreases the GWP of milk at farm by  %, without changing the impact in other categories. Secondly, integrating a variable frequency drive for the irrigation of maize decreases the impact of maize in six of the considered impact categories by  % to  %, while in three categories, there is no substantial change. Finally, powering maize irrigation with photovoltaic solar panels, a decrease from  % to  % can be expected in five categories, whereas no negative effects arise in the other categories.Interpretation and Conclusion: The administration of NOP to cows only decreases the environmental impact in one impact category (GWP). The expected reductions take into account the direct emissions of cows but not potential additional emissions from the manure. Further long-term tests are recommended before a wide implementation should be considered. The integration of the variable speed drive is simple and does not only have environmental benefits, but additionally leads to economic advantages and is therefore a promising option. There are clear environmental advantages of irrigation powered by solar panels. The implementation of this clean technology is feasible, since the installation of the panels is simple and low-priced and because the panels require only little maintenance. In addition, only a very small percentage of the irrigated area (. %) is needed for the installation of the panels.Thus, all three cleantech options are promising and can generally be recommended, but for the adding of  NOP to the feed of cows, additional aspects need to be resolved before implementation.","doc_id":5641,"prior":"freshwater","sdg6":1},{"id":"32","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10174","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Untersuchungen zum Salzgehalt und zur Konsumentenakzeptanz von salzreduzierten Weizenbroten","authors":"Kleinert, Michael; Spitz, Marco; Brugger, Christine; Fratus, Fabio","subject":"Salz; Brot; Schwellentest; Backwaren;  Lebensmitteltechnologie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"664","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Untersuchungen zum Salzgehalt und zur Konsumentenakzeptanz von salzreduzierten Weizenbroten; Salz; Brot; Schwellentest; Backwaren;  Lebensmitteltechnologie; Ziel der Arbeit war es, den Salzgehalt von Broten aus einem Teil des schweizerischen Marktes analytisch zu bestimmen und die Möglichkeit einer Salzreduktion in Brot durch den Einsatz sensorischer Unterschiedstests sowie mittels Erfassung der Beliebtheit von salzreduzierten Broten durch den Konsumenten zu evaluieren.

Damit lassen sich die Auswirkungen von verschiedenen Revitalisierungsmassnahmen auf das System sowohl in ökologischer als auch soziökonomischer Hinsicht unter Berücksichtigung der Hochwassergefährdung vorhersagen und bewerten. Dieser verknüpfte Ansatz bietet die Möglichkeit, unterschiedliche Interessen in Bezug auf die zu erwartenden Auswirkungen von  Revitalisierungsmassnahmen möglichst objektiv zu analysieren, verschiedene Zielsetzungen gegeneinander abzuwägen und geeignete Massnahmen zu priorisieren. Zudem ermöglicht dieses Vorgehen die Lücke zwischen der Bewertung des Istzustandes eines Fliessgewässers und der Erfolgskontrolle nach der Umsetzung von Revitalisierungsmassnahmen zu schliessen. ","doc_id":5977,"prior":"Aue","sdg6":1},{"id":"82","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23534","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Life cycle assessment of a plant-based, regionally marketed shampoo and analysis of refill options","authors":"Kröhnert, Hanna; Stucki, Matthias","subject":"Shampoo; Natural ingredients; Packaging; Refill; LCA; Environmental impact;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Life cycle assessment of a plant-based, regionally marketed shampoo and analysis of refill options; Shampoo; Natural ingredients; Packaging; Refill; LCA; Environmental impact;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; The environmental impact of a plant-based shampoo produced and marketed in Zurich, Switzerland, was analyzed using the life cycle assessment method.

In Switzerland, it is estimated that more than % of all floodplains have disappeared, and only a few are left in the natural state. More than half of the electricity produced in Switzerland comes from hydroelectric power, and again about % of this electricity comes from storage power plants, where fluctuations in the level occur in times of increased power generation. Due to the altered run-off regime, very unstable habitats are created in time and space, and lateral cross-linking decreases, which means that important floodplain habitats are seperated from the river.  Within the scope of this Bachelor thesis, the morphological changes of most important floddplain sites in the hydropeaking stretch of the Sarine/Saane were investigated by means of an evaluation of historical aerial images after the construction of the Rossens dam (Kt.

For the Cambodian population, fish is the most important source of animal protein. In , the NGO Smiling Gecko Cambodia was founded. Through cooperation with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, the Smiling Gecko Fish Project was launched  years later. In order to promote the education and income of surrounding smallholder women farmers and to counteract gender inequality, the Woman in Aquaculture project was launched. The Sun Oxygen System (SOS) was developed by the ZHAW to enable the planned fish breeding ponds to be aerated independently of the electricity grid. A pump powered by a solar panel transports the surface water, which is supersaturated with oxygen through photosynthesis by algae, into deeper layers. In this way, the excess oxygen does not immediately diffuse into the ambient air but can be stored for longer by the entire water column. For this work, a feeding trial with Nile tilapias was conducted in two fish ponds (water volume  m) to validate the benefits of the SOS. One pond was operated with an SOS, the other without. Besides daily measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, water quality parameters were analysed and SOS performance was monitored. Due to excessive oxygen consumption at night and a clogged SOS pump, the trial was split into two trials. Trial A was started with a fish density of . kg/m (. kg/m). Trial B was continued with a fish density of . kg/m (. kg/m). The daily DO concentrations of the two ponds recorded during Trial B showed a . kg higher oxygen input during the day in the pond with SOS. However, this increased oxygen input was used up again overnight, so that the morning DO concentration with SOS was always lower from the th day (Trial B) of the trial than without SOS, and from the th day (Trial B) onwards no longer rose above  mg/l. Weighing the fish did not yield any useful data, as the feeding trial was stopped early in both trials due to the DO concentration being too low. The sample size of the weighed fish in both trials was considered too small to calculate a representative average weight, as the scatter of the weights was too large. Daily DO concentration curves were used to show the effect of SOS on pond water mixing. While without SOS a stratification with different DO concentrations takes place, with SOS the DO concentration is balanced in the evening. An analysis of the SOS performance showed that on sunny days a power surplus of . kWh is produced, which can be used for additional energy consumers. The reasons for the high oxygen consumption overnight were then discussed. Possible solutions were identified and design changes were proposed for further SOS tests.","doc_id":6432,"prior":"water quality","sdg6":1},{"id":"4","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21290","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"MyFishCheck : a model to assess fish welfare in aquaculture","authors":"Tschirren, Linda; Bachmann, David Andrea; Güler, Ali Cem; Blaser, Oliver; Rhyner, Nicola; Seitz, Andreas; Zbinden, Erich; Wahli, Thomas; Segner, Helmut; Refardt, Dominik","subject":"Aquaculture; Fish welfare; Ontology; Semantic data model; Animal welfare assessment;  Aquakultur","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"639.8","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"MyFishCheck : a model to assess fish welfare in aquaculture; Aquaculture; Fish welfare; Ontology; Semantic data model; Animal welfare assessment;  Aquakultur; Welfare in animal husbandry includes considerations of biology, ethics, ecology, law and economics.

To assist this process in the field of aquaculture, where such methods are largely missing, we developed a model to assess fish welfare. A network of information was created to link needs, i.e., fundamental requirements for welfare, with parameters, i.e., quantifiable aspects of welfare. From this ontology,  parameters that are relevant for welfare, have practicable assessment methods and deliver reliable results were selected and incorporated into a model. The model, named MyFishCheck, allows the evaluation of welfare in five distinct modules: farm management, water quality, fish group behaviour, fish external and fish internal appearance, thereby yielding five individual grades categorising welfare ranging from critical, to poor, to acceptable, and good. To facilitate the use of the model, a software application was written. With its adaptability to different fish species, farming systems, regulations and purposes as well as its user-friendly digital version, MyFishCheck is a next step towards improved fish welfare assessment and provides a basis for ongoing positive developments for the industry, the farmers and the fish.","doc_id":6762,"prior":"water quality","sdg6":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/15387","date":"2019","language":"de","title":"Optimierungsmöglichkeiten in einem Heizungssystem mit Sole/Wasser-Wärmepumpe und PVT Kollektoren (Simulationsstudie mit Polysun)","authors":"Manuel, Hunziker","subject":" Ingenieurwesen","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"620","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Optimierungsmöglichkeiten in einem Heizungssystem mit Sole/Wasser-Wärmepumpe und PVT Kollektoren (Simulationsstudie mit Polysun);  Ingenieurwesen; L-Sol is a new heat pump system based on a brine/water heat pump without the disadvantages of established heat pump systems such as noise emissions or high investment costs.

The method combines the separation of sample constituents by thin layer chromatography with the direct detection of estrogenic compounds on the surface of the HPTLC-plate. The previous protocol using the immersion of a normal phase silica HPTLC-plate in a cell suspension for bio-autography resulted in blurred signals due to the accelerated diffusion of compounds on the wet surface of the HPTLC-plate. Here, the application of the yeast cells by spraying on the surface of the HPTLC-plate is described as an alternative approach. The presented method for the hyphenation of normal phase thin layer chromatography with a yeast estrogen screen results in much sharper signals compared to reports in previous publications. Satisfying results were achieved using cultures with cell densities of  FAU. Due to the reduced signal broadening, lower limits of quantification for estrogenic compounds were achieved (Estrone (E) =  pg/zone, β-estradiol (E) = . pg/zone, α-ethinylestradiol (EE) = . pg/zone and Estriol (E) =  pg/zone). As demonstrated, it is possible to characterize profiles of estrogenic activity of wastewater samples with high quality and reproducibility. The improved sensitivity opens the stage for applications using native samples from waste- or even surface water directly applied on HPTLC-plates without the need for prior sample treatment by e.g. solid phase extraction.","doc_id":7364,"prior":"wastewater","sdg6":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19120","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Entwicklungsszenarien einer alpinen Aue bei einem natürlichen Geschiebedefizit : die Triftaue im Oberhasli","authors":"Schweizer, S.; Niedermayr, A.; Roulier, C.; Döring, M.; Meyer, M.; Schläppi, S.; Baumgartner, J.; Berger, B.; Rohrer, M.; Fahner, S.; Schwegler, B.; Fankhauser, A.","subject":"Ökologie; Aue; Wasserkraft;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"333.7","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Entwicklungsszenarien einer alpinen Aue bei einem natürlichen Geschiebedefizit : die Triftaue im Oberhasli; Ökologie; Aue; Wasserkraft;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; In der zweiten Hälfte des .

Although L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen it does not infect or survive intracellular in Acanthamoeba castellanii, unlike several other facultative intracellular bacteria. Instead, motile L. monocytogenes can form large aggregates on amoebal cells and are effectively phagocytosed and eventually digested by Acanthamoeba.

Moreover, we found that the presence of Acanthamoeba strongly promotes growth of the bacteria in non-nutrient saline, by releasing nutrients or other growth promoters.

Lebende Sprache  (): -.; The recent advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and ready access to freely available online tools are raising people's expectations that quality translation is only a click away, with media dramatically citing research reports claiming human parity for neural machine translation (NMT; Hassan et al. ). Neglected in this discourse is the sobering reality of the risks and cultural inappropriateness associated with the misleadingly fluent output of some of these systems (cf. Martindale & Carpuat ). Within translation studies and among the professional translation community, interest in digital literacy with respect to recent advances in NMT has been growing (e.g. Forcada ). It now seems generally accepted that translation students should develop the capacity to decide on the deployment of language technologies by learning about the capabilities and limitations of the machines and tools with which they are and will be working (cf. Massey & Ehrensberger-Dow ). This type of knowledge has been referred to as MT literacy by Bowker and Buitrago Ciro (), whose list of component competences probably seems familiar to most institutions currently involved in translator training (e.g. comprehend the basics of MT systems; appreciate the wider implications associated with the use of MT; evaluate how MT-friendly texts are; create or modify a text so that it could be translated; modify MT output to improve its accuracy and readability). MT literacy can inform judgements about the appropriate genres, quality expectations, risks, and limitations that call for intervention by human translators. Although rarely mentioned in this context, those judgements also necessarily draw on the rich intercultural awareness that translators bring to their work. As intercultural mediators, they have been trained to recognize and deal with cultural differences, potential ambiguity, terminological inconsistencies as well as conceptual and lexical gaps as they transfer meaning from one language to another (e.g. Federici & Declercq ). This is very much in line with Earley and Ang’s (: ) multidimensional concept of cultural intelligence, which they define as “a person’s capability for successful adaptation to new cultural settings”. The extension of this concept to “intercultural intelligence” captures the reality of translators shifting back and forth between the context of the source text and that of the target text. Conceptualising MT literacy as being at the interface between language-related artificial intelligence and intercultural intelligence allows for the integration of apparently opposite poles of the human-machine spectrum. Such a conceptualisation can provide the space to encourage the development of expertise in language technology and at the same time foster the uniquely human dimensions of intercultural mediation, intuition, creativity, and ethical judgement.","doc_id":7849,"prior":"Aue","sdg6":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/21228","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Environmental parameters and microbial community profiles as indication towards microbial activities and diversity in aquaponic system compartments","authors":"Schmautz, Zala; Espinal, Carlos A.; Bohny, Andrea M.; Rezzonico, Fabio; Junge, Ranka; Frossard, Emmanuel; Smits, Theo H.

The images revealed the longitudinal thermal pattern of the Urbach River in Switzerland – there was gradual cooling in the upstream half of the study section and then warming in the remaining downstream portion. This pattern persisted through the diurnal warming and cooling cycle. The spatio-temporal thermal pattern was explained by a model that included distributed thermal inputs of cooler water in the upstream half coming from alluvial fans and warmer water in the downstream half running off steep cliffs that warm snowmelt. The warm inputs from the cliffs were confirmed by the thermal imaging. These data and the associated modeling illustrated that distributed inflows can overwhelm the influence of atmospheric fluxes, and that their knowledge is critical for understanding stream temperatures. The combination of modeling and detailed time-lapse thermal imaging allowed for identification and quantification of processes critical to in-stream temperature dynamics in a proglacial river.","doc_id":8377,"prior":"floodplain","sdg6":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11567","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Solubility and plant uptake of metals with and without liming of sludge-amended soils","authors":"Krebs, Rolf; Gupta, Satish Kumar; Furrer, Gerhard; Schulin, Rainer","subject":"Liming; Boden; Heavy metals;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363, 577","year":"1998","for_data_analysis":"Solubility and plant uptake of metals with and without liming of sludge-amended soils; Liming; Boden; Heavy metals;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Ökologie; Excessive applications of sewage sludge and pig manure have led to the accumulation of potentially toxic elements in soils.

However, damming, water storage, and hydropower production affect many floodplains by altering their natural habitat diversity. Field sampling data and imaging spectroscopy are used in combination with statistical models to assess resource allocation strategies of willow stands in perialpine floodplains. Three contrasting floodplain reaches located along two rivers in Switzerland serve as test beds: The Sarine River is partitioned into an upstream and downstream segment under the influence of a dam and a hydropower plant, while the Sense River represents an undisturbed, natural floodplain. Airborne imaging spectrometer data allow mapping of spatially distributed Competitor/Stress tolerator/Ruderal (CSR) strategies using a partial least square modeling approach. Using cross validation, we demonstrate that a statistical modeling approach can reveal variations in CSR scores based on the StrateFy model. Such intraspecific variation of CSR scores cannot be captured by a strategy categorization based solely on the species. Results reveal that willows shifted toward more competition and less stress tolerance along hydrologically altered reaches compared to the willows strategy along the natural control. Moreover, the overall distribution of strategies indicates that stress factors (i.e., limiting growth factors), rather than disturbance (i.e., events leading to partial or total destruction), shape the plant traits of alluvial willow trees.

Therefore, trials in the field outside and in a net house were the purpose of this thesis with the aim to find the best suitable biological treatment to control the DBM in Cambodia. For each trial,  Chinese cabbages Brassica pekinensis (Lour.) Rupra were planted in  plots ( plants each). Five treatment groups were tested with four replicates per group. The first treatment was the insect-pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (product: BB-Protec) which controls a wide range of insect pests. Second, a host specific granulovirus of P. xylostella (product: Plutex). The farmer standard as a local method was used for group nr . The fourth treatment was a combination of the Products BB-Protec and Plutex. Finally, a control group treated only with water. Two times per week, the number of DBM eggs, DBM larvae and cabbage leaf damage was observed and proto-colled, right before the application of the treatments. Further, any kind of other pests that were pre-sent were recorded as well. At the end of each trial, the harvest weight was measured. Results for eggs per plant was the lowest in treatment farmer standard (.) and Plutex (.) in the field trial and the net house, respectively. Plants treated with water had the lowest average num-ber of larvae per plant in the field (.). In the net house, no larvae were found in the Plutex group. The lowest damage value showed the combination of BB-Protec and Plutex (. out of ) in the field. Cabbages were the least damaged when treated with BB-Protec, farmer standard or BB-Protec & Plutex in the net house (. out of ). In both trials, the presence of P. xylostella was smaller than expected. Weather factors like higher temperatures and an insufficient water supply due to drought caused death to a lot of plants.

Aboveground biomass production declined by % due to experimental drought (standardised local extremity by rainfall exclusion for - consecutive days). Species richness did not affect resistance but promoted recovery. Recovery was only positively affected by species richness in low-productive communities, with most diverse communities even showing overcompensation. This positive diversity effect could be linked to asynchrony of species responses.

We established communities of European meadow species, which were subjected to warming and extreme event (drought and deluge) treatments in a factorial design at an experimental garden in Zurich, Switzerland. Phylogenetically matched pairs of native and alien species (Bromus erectus, B. inermis, Trifolium pratense, T. hybridum, Lactuca serriola, and Conyza canadensis) were introduced into the communities to test if invader performance is favored by warming and extreme events, and if alien invaders perform better than native colonizers. With a warming of on average .°C, a higher cover of native plant communities was observed, while drought decreased cover in the short-term and lowered biomass. Germination, survival, and growth of the introduced species were lower under elevated temperature. Survival of all pairs and growth of Trifolium was greater in drought pots, while deluge had no effect. While the alien species showed a faster rate of increase in the number of leaves, mortality of alien species was greater than of native species. Overall, the performance of the focal species varied much more among taxonomic groups than native/alien provenances. The results suggest that with climate change, different types of extreme events will differ in the severity of their effects on native plant communities. Meanwhile, the effects of climate change on plant invasions are more likely to operate indirectly through the impacts on native vegetation.","doc_id":8738,"prior":"drought","sdg6":1},{"id":"22","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10344","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Green roofs in Switzerland : urban habitats for ground-nesting birds, insects and plants","authors":"Baumann, Nathalie","subject":"Natural roofs; Urban habitat; Biodiversity; Ground-nesting birds;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"333, 577","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"Green roofs in Switzerland : urban habitats for ground-nesting birds, insects and plants; Natural roofs; Urban habitat; Biodiversity; Ground-nesting birds;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen;  Ökologie; Green roof activities and research in Switzerland have focused for many years on the potential of habitat creation on roof surfaces to compensate for the loss of habitats that are destroyed or damaged on the ground as a result of development - ecological compensation.

The analysis shows that building infrastructure and catering are the main contributors for various environmental impacts, followed by heating and electricity. Waste and wastewater, pharmaceuticals, and medical and housekeeping products are relevant for at least three categories, whereas textiles, and paper use and printing are only relevant for one to two categories. Direct water use and laundry, and large medical equipment are  only responsible for  a small share of  the  impact in  all categories. The carbon footprint of an average hospital is . tonnes COeq per FU and the main impact stems from heating with . t COeq per FU.

A known drawback is that a compromise away from optimal growing conditions for plants and fish must be achieved to produce both crops and fish in the same environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to develop a theoretical concept of a decoupled aquaponic system (DAPS), and predict water, nutrient (N and P), fish, sludge, and plant levels. This has been approached by developing a dynamic aquaponic system model, using inputs from data found in literature covering the fields of aquaculture, hydroponics, and sludge treatment. The outputs from the model showed the dependency of aquacultural water quality on the hydroponic evapotranspiration rate. This result can be explained by the fact that DAPS is based on one-way flows. These one-way flows results in accumulations of remineralized nutrients in the hydroponic component ensuring optimal conditions for the plants. The study also suggests to size the cultivation area based on P availability in the hydroponic component as P is an exhaustible resource and has been identified one of the main limiting factors for plant growth.","doc_id":10028,"prior":"water quality","sdg6":1},{"id":"5","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2518","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The multifunctional aquaponic system at ZHAW used as research and training lab","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Antenen, Nadine; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Education; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"630","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"The multifunctional aquaponic system at ZHAW used as research and training lab; Aquaponics; Education; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft; Aquaponics plays a part in promoting sustainable development on different levels in society, and its use is becoming ever more widespread.

The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of institutions of higher education – like ZHAW – can play to mitigate this deficit. ZHAW has the ability to execute applied research, teaching on BSc and MSc level, and is aiming to increase societal added value concerning education and health. Each of these levels has different demands on the aquaponic system concerning a multitude of factors, such as access, size, construction, climate control, diversity of production methods, recycling and closed loop systems, provision of energy from renewable sources and rainwater harvesting, treatment and use. To evaluate how these objectives are reached, the requirements on the system originating from each level are defined. These are used to evaluate the aquaponic system that was built and operated at ZHAW. Other aquaponic systems in use are compared to the ZHAW system, using the same evaluation criteria.

This emerging technology has the potential to play a key role in provision of food while tackling global challenges such as water scarcity, food safety, food security, urbanization, and reductions in energy use and food miles. While it is a widely discussed technology today (about .m hits on Google in May ), only very few research papers were published describing efficiency and performance of real systems. Results: In , the Swiss company UrbanFarmers, a spin-off of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) built a  m greenhouse farm on an industrial rooftop in Basel (UF ). Together with the research team at ZHAW, the aquaponic farm layout was planned, installed, operated and monitored. In its first year of operations,  kg Tilapia and ’ kg of different vegetables were produced and sold to restaurants, and to Migros, Switzerland’s largest retailer. This pilot farm achieved three major goals: to showcase the proof of technology for aquaponic rooftop farms, to demonstrate proof of market acceptance by Swiss consumers for this new way of farming food, and to deliver key performance figures that allow planning and scale-up for future commercially interesting farm units. Conclusion: Further innovations are required that simplify operations and enable cost-effective aquaponic farming, while making the products safe for human consumption: new planting techniques, new varieties of produce, biological pest control, irrigation techniques, and integration with existing building infrastructures.","doc_id":10147,"prior":"water scarcity","sdg6":1},{"id":"4","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2929","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Combining single-use stirred bioreactor with standard cross-flow technology in biphasic protein production processes at pilot scale","authors":"Blaschczok, Katharina; Löffelholz, Christian; Eibl-Schindler, Regine; Eibl, Dieter","subject":"Biphasic protein expression; Chinese hamster ovary cells; Hollow fiber module; SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase); Stirred single-use bioreactor;  Technische Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"660","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Combining single-use stirred bioreactor with standard cross-flow technology in biphasic protein production processes at pilot scale; Biphasic protein expression; Chinese hamster ovary cells; Hollow fiber module; SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase); Stirred single-use bioreactor;  Technische Chemie; The increasing implementation of single-use bioreactors arrived hand-in-hand with the development of new technologies contributing to increased productivity, process flexibility, and additional savings in time and costs.

Aquaponic systems, which combine aquaculture and vegetable food production offer alternative technology solutions for a world that is increasingly under stress through population growth, urbanisation, water shortages, land and soil degradation, environmental pollution, world hunger and climate change.; Hydroponics is a method to grow crops without soil, and as such, these systems are added to aquaculture components to create aquaponics systems. Thus, together with the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), hydroponic production forms a key part of the aqua-agricultural system of aquaponics. Many different existing hydroponic technologies can be applied when designing aquaponics systems. This depends on the environmental and financial circumstances, the type of crop that is cultivated and the available space. This chapter provides an overview of different hydroponic types, including substrates, nutrients and nutrient solutions, and disinfection methods of the recirculating nutrient solutions.","doc_id":10637,"prior":"recirculating aquaculture system","sdg6":1},{"id":"53","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7262","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Old-field succession along a precipitation gradient in the semi-arid coastal region of Tenerife","authors":"Otto, R.; Krüsi, Bertil; Burga, C.A.; Fernández-Palacios, J.-M.","subject":"Secondary succession; Canary Islands; Chronosequence; Succulent scrub;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7","year":"2006","for_data_analysis":"Old-field succession along a precipitation gradient in the semi-arid coastal region of Tenerife; Secondary succession; Canary Islands; Chronosequence; Succulent scrub;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete; Secondary succession on abandoned fields was studied in the semi-arid region of Tenerife (Canary Islands). At four different sites along a precipitation gradient four chronosequences were sampled. On the whole,  fields, abandoned for eight to  years, and adjacent near-tonatural stands were studied, with regard to species richness, species composition, vegetation structure, life form distribution and the importance of endemic/exotic species, using uni- and multivariate statistical methods.In the three drier chronosequences species richness increased significantly during succession whereas in the wettest sequence it peaked very early with a subsequent decline towards the mature stand. Temporal changes in floristic composition were significant and revealed clear directional trends. We could distinguish two pathways of succession: one for the northern coast under more humid conditions and one for the southern coast under arid conditions. Therophytes were generally substituted by nanophanerophytes, while hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes showed low abundances with peaks in late successional stages. At all sites, endemic species replaced exotic species, with regard to both relative number and cover. The relative importance of exotic species in early succession increased with increasing precipitation. Cover of perennials, stand height and stand biomass increased with time since abandonment and water availability. Floristic composition recovered faster than stand structure and, in particular, stand biomass.We have the following conclusions (i) The absence of disturbance and in presence of near-to-natural stands in the surroundings, coastal scrub on Tenerife has the capacity to regenerate completely albeit slowly after traditional agricultural use. (ii) The rate and pathway of succession are influenced by site productivity, i.e. mean annual precipitation. (iii) Life form distribution changed in the second phase of succession in relation with the precipitation gradient. (iv) The initially dominant exotic annual plant species seem to be a temporary problem only since, in the course of succession, they are substituted by native perennials.","doc_id":10763,"prior":"water availability","sdg6":1},{"id":"85","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/9272","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"An inorganic hydrothermal route to photocatalytically active bismuth vanadate","authors":"Zhou, Ying; Vuille, Kathrin; Heel, Andre; Probst, Benjamin; Kontic, Roman; Patzke, Greta R.","subject":"Hydrothermal synthesis; Oxygen evolution; Bismuth vanadate; Photocatalysis;  Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"540","year":"2010","for_data_analysis":"An inorganic hydrothermal route to photocatalytically active bismuth vanadate; Hydrothermal synthesis; Oxygen evolution; Bismuth vanadate; Photocatalysis;  Chemie; BiVO has attracted research interest as one of the most promising visible-light-driven oxidic photocatalysts for water splitting and wastewater treatment.

A secondary but simultaneously running process in this context is coal gasification, where the residual charcoal under oxygen exposure in turn reacts to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. Depending on process parameters like temperature, air- or water supply rate, a thermo-chemical system can favour either typical wood gasification, or typical coal-gasification reactions. The assumption is that a device, capable of deliberately switching between the two modes of operation would be more robust and flexible with respect to changing wood input quality. In order to gain more knowledge about the exact conditions required to run the process in either one of the two modes, a thermochemical, fluid-dynamic model of the combined processes was created using system dynamic principles. The transient D model is based on species balances, the minimization of molar Gibbs free energy of formation of the chemical compounds as well as kinetic considerations. An experimental wood gasifier was built to validate the predictions of the model regarding the state of the gasification process, based on temperature profile measurements. There is a high degree of agreement between the computational results and experimental data. Furthermore the model provides deep insight into the transient evolution of the different chemical reactions and thus also knowledge about limiting parameters.

A hierarchical Bayesian model is applied to obtain consistent estimates of tail dependence using relatively short time series.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of temperature extremes on various phenological events of grapevine varieties in Southwest Switzerland (Leytron, Canton of Valais). We aimed to capture the occurrence of extreme events in specific years in various grapevine varieties and at different phenological phases to rank the varieties based on their sensitivity to temperature extremes and thus quantify their robustness. Phenological observations (–) of six Vitis vinifera varieties (Arvine, Chardonnay, Chasselas, Gamay, Pinot noir and Syrah) were subjected to event coincidence analysis. Extreme events were defined as values in the uppermost or lowermost percentiles of the timing of the phenophases and daily temperatures within a -day window before the phenophase event occurred. Significantly more extreme temperature and phenological events occurred in Leytron between  and  than in the earlier years, with the years , ,  and  being remarkable in terms of the number of extreme coincidence events. Moreover, bud development and flowering experienced significantly more extreme coincidence events than other phenophases; however, the occurrence rate of extreme coincidence events was independent of the phenophase. Based on the total number of extreme events, the varieties did not differ in their responses to temperature extremes. Therefore, event coincidence analysis is an appropriate tool to quantify the occurrence of extreme events. The occurrence of extreme temperature events clearly affected the advancement of the timings of phenological events in various grapevines. However, there were no varietal differences in terms of response to extreme temperatures; thus, additional research is warranted to outline the best adaptation measures.","doc_id":11465,"prior":"drought","sdg6":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2359","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"The effect of anaerobic and aerobic fish sludge supernatant on hydroponic lettuce","authors":"Goddek, Simon; Schmautz, Zala; Scott, Benjamin; Delaide, Boris; Keesman, Karel J.; Wuertz, Sven; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Zee; Oeko; Iunr;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"The effect of anaerobic and aerobic fish sludge supernatant on hydroponic lettuce; Zee; Oeko; Iunr;  Landwirtschaft; The mobilization of nutrients from fish sludge (i.e., feces and uneaten feed) plays a key role in optimizing the resource utilization and thus in improving the sustainability of aquaponic systems. While several studies have documented the aerobic and anaerobic digestion performance of aquaculture sludge, the impact of the digestate on plant growth has yet to be understood. The present study examines the impact of either an aerobic or an anaerobic digestion effluent on lettuce plant growth, by enriching a mixture of aquaculture and tap water with supernatants from both aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors. The lettuce plants grown in the hydroponic system supplied with supernatant from an anaerobic reactor had significantly better performance with respect to weight gain than both, those in the system where supernatant from the aerobic reactor was added, as well as the control system. It can be hypothesized that this effect was caused by the presence of NH+ as well as dissolved organic matter, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and fungi, and humic acid, which are predominantly present in anaerobic effluents.

Since many different TPs can potentially be formed in the environment and analytical standards are typically lacking for these compounds, knowledge on the prevalence of TPs in aquatic environments is fragmentary. In this study, an efficient procedure was therefore developed to comprehensively screen for large numbers of potential TPs in environmental samples. It is based on a target list of plausible TPs that has been assembled using the University of Minnesota Pathway Prediction System (UM-PPS) for the computer-aided prediction of products of microbial metabolism and an extensive search for TPs reported in the scientific literature. The analytical procedure for screening of the compounds on the target list has been developed to allow for the detection of a broad range of compounds in complex environmental samples in the absence of commercially available reference standards. It includes solid phase extraction with broad enrichment efficiency, followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry with high mass resolution and accuracy. The identification of target TPs consisted of extracting the exact mass from the chromatogram, selecting peaks of sufficient intensity, checking the plausibility of the retention time, and interpreting mass spectra. The procedure was used to screen for TPs of  pesticides, biocides, and pharmaceuticals in seven representative surface water samples from different regions in Switzerland. Altogether,  TPs were identified, including both some well-known and commonly detected TPs, and some rarely reported ones (e.g., biotransformation products of the pharmaceuticals venlafaxine and verapamil, or of the pesticide azoxystrobin). Overall, the rather low number of TPs detected suggests that TPs may not pose a problem of unexpected magnitude for aquatic resources.","doc_id":12164,"prior":"water quality","sdg6":1},{"id":"70","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3144","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Determining specific biomass activity in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes","authors":"Petrozzi, Sergio; Mol, Nuri; Dunn, Irving J.","subject":"Biomass; Batch reactor; Wastewater treatment process; Biomass activity; Cellulose production;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"1992","for_data_analysis":"Determining specific biomass activity in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes; Biomass; Batch reactor; Wastewater treatment process; Biomass activity; Cellulose production;  Biochemie; «Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch)»; An experimental method for the measurement of specific gas production rate was developed and tested with biomass samples taken from anaerobic fluidized bed reactors, operating with a variety of carriers with molasses, condensate from cellulose production and brewery wastewater as feeds.

On a local level, cities in particular may serve as change agents to influence the energy-related behaviour and decision making of their citizens. For instance, citizens may initiate or promote campaigns that aim to change energy-relevant routines and purchasing behaviour. While there are many innovative and successful ideas for energy-saving campaigns, these often only reach a small portion of the population that is already aware of the issue and engaged in sustainable behaviours and practices. Moreover, it is often not ensured that the interventions’ effects will be long lasting. Thus, one key question is how to reach a broader public and boost the impact of an energy-saving campaign. Together with the administration of a Swiss city that serves as a transition lab, we designed a field experiment at a public swimming pool. The swimming pool was recently refurbished, and new, low flow shower heads were installed to save water and energy. The study design includes a campaign to raise awareness for the water-energy nexus (the link between warm water provision and energy). Moreover, the performance of the new shower heads and shower experience were evaluated. In our study, we also addressed the question of whether a city’s intervention has a distinguished effect on groups versus individuals and whether groups interact more to exchange opinions about the campaign. Results show that group members actually exchange more than individuals, but the content of this opinion exchange is not necessarily positive.","doc_id":12228,"prior":"water provision","sdg6":1},{"id":"36","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/12820","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Incentives for quality provision and environmental innovations by water supply utilities","authors":"Kuhn, Thomas; Pittel, Karen","subject":"Asymmetric information; Quality provision; Supply utilities;  Wirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"330","year":"1997","for_data_analysis":"Incentives for quality provision and environmental innovations by water supply utilities; Asymmetric information; Quality provision; Supply utilities;  Wirtschaft; This paper deals with optimal regulatory policies to provide for quality of service and innovations in abatement technology by water supply utilities.

The physical-chemical properties of soils and sediments in these habitats vary spatio-temporally with changes in hydrology, thereby influencing microbial dynamics and general floodplain functioning. The major goals of this study were to characterize the spatio-temporal variation of terrestrial and aquatic floodplain habitats and elucidate microbial function as a mechanistic basis underlying floodplain functioning. Microbial functional variables (i.e., soil-sediment respiration, enzyme activity) as well as a microbial state variable (i.e., bacterial abundance, BA) were assessed in conjunction with abiotic properties of respective soils and sediments in different floodplain habitats over an annual cycle. BA and respiration differed significantly among habitat types, being lowest in early successional gravel and stream channel (i.e., water) habitats and highest in older successional habitats of mature forest, islands, and riparian pasture/grassland. Coarse-scale floodplain hydrology influenced the spatial variation in microbial measures within specific habitats. A non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) clearly separated habitat types based on the functional activities of eight tested enzymes and specific microbial variables could be linked to soil-sediment respiration. These results document a high functional heterogeneity of soil and sediment microbial variables that complements the shifting habitat mosaic found in most natural floodplains.

Clean technologies, such as renewable energies, have the potential to significantly reduce these environmental repercussions of agriculture. Countries like South Africa have a coal intensive electricity mix, as well as high solar irradiation and a dry climate which is why agricultural crops are produced under fossil energy intensive irrigation. At the same time, the high solar irradiation could be used for the generation of photovoltaic electricity as a renewable power supply for irrigation. A joint research project between the University of Cape Town and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences quantified the environmental impacts of South African maize production (Zea mays) and the improvement potential of maize irrigation with photovoltaic electricity by means of life cycle assessment (LCA).The LCA includes the whole value chain of maize production from cultivation to storage in a silo for six months, respectively with a functional unit of one kilogram of maize at silo storage produced either on dry land or under irrigation. Electricity consumption for irrigation was identified as an environmental hotspot in the impacts related to greenhouse gas emissions from maize production. Therefore, clean electricity would be the starting point to reduce the carbon footprint of South Africa’s maize. We calculated that replacement of South African electricity mix with photovoltaic electricity in the maize irrigation can reduce environmental impacts by up to %. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of maize on dry land without irrigation, under irrigation and under irrigation using photovoltaic electricity, are . kg CO-eq. and . kg CO-eq. and . kg CO-eq., respectively, with a potential reduction of % if the electricity is supplied from photovoltaics compared to the conventional fossil electricity mix. The analysis of further indicators reveals a reduction for non-renewable energy demand (nuclear and fossil), acidification, freshwater eutrophication and human toxicity of carcinogenic substances. The irrigation of a maize field of one hectare consumes ' kWh of electricity per year, which, in turn, requires a solar power plant with an area of  m. We computed that a total area of  ha of solar panels would suffice to produce the total electricity requirement of the current maize production area under irrigation. This corresponds to more than approximately ' t CO-eq. saved per year.Compared to data representing maize production in the United States and in Switzerland, South African maize production has a higher global warming potential per kilogram of maize due to lower yields in South Africa.The replacement of the South African electricity mix in the irrigation with electricity from photovoltaics has proven to be an effective clean technology to reduce environmental impacts associated with maize production in South Africa. Compared to the irrigated field area, land use for PV panels is almost negligible and is therefore no limiting factor in the implementation of irrigation using photovoltaic electricity.","doc_id":12771,"prior":"freshwater","sdg6":1},{"id":"6","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/10913","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Trinkwasser mit PV Strom auf den Wädenswiler Berg pumpen : Solarstrom für Wädenswiler Pumpwerke","authors":"Engeli, Patrick","subject":"Photovoltaikanlage; Solarstrom; Trinkwasserreservoir; Trinkwasser auf den Berg pumpen; Photovoltaic system; Solar power; Drinking water reservoir; Drinking water on the mountain;  Energie","type":"Thesis: Bachelor","bid":"333.79","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Trinkwasser mit PV Strom auf den Wädenswiler Berg pumpen : Solarstrom für Wädenswiler Pumpwerke; Photovoltaikanlage; Solarstrom; Trinkwasserreservoir; Trinkwasser auf den Berg pumpen; Photovoltaic system; Solar power; Drinking water reservoir; Drinking water on the mountain;  Energie; This thesis deals with the topic \"Drinking water with PV electricity on the Wädenswiler mountain pumps\" and explains the plant design for three reservoirs in the urban area of Wädenswil.

Using sequences of aerial images, we quantified seven decades (/–) of spatiotemporal changes in channel and floodplain morphology, as well as changes in the physical habitats, of three floodplain river reaches of the Swiss pre‐Alps, two hydropower‐regulated and one near‐natural. In the Sarine River floodplain, within the first decades of hydropower impairment, the magnitude and frequency of flood events (Q, Q, Q) decreased substantially. As a result, the area of pioneer floodplain habitats that depend on flood activity and sediment dynamic, such as bare sediments, decreased dramatically by approximately %. However, by  vegetated areas had generally increased in comparison to the pre‐regulation period in , indicating general vegetative colonization. Between  and , the active channel underwent essential narrowing (up to % width reduction in the residual flow reach) and habitat turnover rates were very low (% of the total floodplain area changed habitat type five to six times). In contrast, from the s onwards, the near‐natural floodplain of the Sense River experienced recurrent narrowing and widening, and frequent changes between bare and vegetated areas, reflecting the shifting habitat mosaic concept typical for natural floodplains. In the three reaches investigated, we found that the active floodplain width and erosion of vegetated areas were primarily controlled by medium to large floods (Q, Q), which combined with reduced time intervals between ordinary floods ≥ Q most likely mobilized streambed sediments and limited the ability of vegetation to establish itself on bare gravel bars within the parafluvial zone. These findings can contribute to restoration action plans such as controlled flooding and sediment replenishments in the Sarine and other floodplain rivers of the Alps.","doc_id":13161,"prior":"floodplain","sdg6":1},{"id":"14","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20203","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Tap versus bottled water consumption : the influence of social norms, affect and image on consumer choice","authors":"Etale, Anita; Jobin, Marilou; Siegrist, Michael","subject":"Affect; Bottled water image; Convenience; Environmental concern;  Marketingmanagement","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"658.8","year":"2018","for_data_analysis":"Tap versus bottled water consumption : the influence of social norms, affect and image on consumer choice; Affect; Bottled water image; Convenience; Environmental concern;  Marketingmanagement; What drives consumers to choose bottled water instead of tap water where the latter is safe, accessible, costs far less, and in spite of its environmental impacts?

The concept of microinsurance is a solution to help mitigating the vicious cycle of poverty, while also offering insurance companies an opportunity for strategic market expansion in this vast untapped market. In the African microinsurance market, a share of only -% of the low- and middle-income population is covered by a microinsurance policy. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate distribution channels with the potential to promote microinsurance products in the East African market based on selected supply-and-demand side criteria and taking into consideration economic, financial and social factors. Thereby, this study followed a qualitative approach that included both secondary and primary research, the latter being conducted in the form of four semi-structured expert interviews. It was identified that the microinsurance market is still in its infancy and the challenges are various. The low-income target groups have continued negative perceptions of insurance companies and their products. They consequently have a lack of trust in them and see limited value in it. This is compounded by low financial literacy rates of the target customers and insurers have limited access to potential customers as urbanization rates are low. Therefore, facing these challenges, insurance companies rely mainly on distribution channels that provide direct, personal and broad access to these low-income individuals. Especially the distribution of products through cooperatives and community-organizations is a valuable option because trust, transparency and sustainability are ensured. Furthermore, it is crucial to embed the insurance product into the business of distributors such as microfinance institutions and retail stores to integrate insurance further into these low-income population’s life. Mobile Network Operators, which are widely known and used in the market on a daily basis, represent a promising option for the future if the issue of simplicity of the products is further solved. Nevertheless, additional capacity building in the form of trainings, information campaigns using simple pictures is essential to overcome the aforementioned issues and to enhance financial literacy and trust in the East African market.Digital platforms, evolving in Africa at high growth rates, have an important impact on the further development of microinsurance distribution. The integration of technology-based tools to develop the microinsurance market is a viable opportunity for insurance companies to facilitate processes, scale the business and reach more customers even in rural areas while optimizing the distribution costs. An interesting focus for further research is therefore the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data and as a result new business models such as index-based insurance or on-demand insurance to further penetrate and develop the microinsurance market.","doc_id":13472,"prior":"drought","sdg6":1},{"id":"63","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11570","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Control of miniature proton exchange fuel cells based on fuzzy logic","authors":"Schumacher, Jürgen; Gemmar, Peter; Denne, Matthias; Zedda, Mario; Stüber, M.","subject":"Fuzzy logic; Control; Fuel cells;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"621.3","year":"2004","for_data_analysis":"Control of miniature proton exchange fuel cells based on fuzzy logic; Fuzzy logic; Control; Fuel cells;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; A control strategy is presented in this paper which is suitable for miniature hydrogen/air proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The control approach is based on process modelling using fuzzy logic and tested using a PEM stack consisting of  cells with parallel channels on the cathode side and a meander-shaped flow-field on the anode side. The active area per cell is  cm^. Commercially available materials are used for the bipolar plates,gas diffusion layers and the membrane-electrode assembly. It is concluded from basic thermodynamic principles that water management at different temperatures can be achieved by controlling the air stoichiometry. This is achieved by varying the fan voltage for the air supply of the PEM stack. A control strategy of the Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) type, based on fuzzy logic, is presented. The TSK-type controller offers the advantage that the system output can be computed in an efficient way: the rule consequents of the controller combine the system variables in linear equations. It is shown experimentally that drying out of the membrane at high temperatures can be monitored by measuring the AC impedance of the fuel cell stack at a frequency of kHz. Flooding of single cells leads to an abrupt drop of the corresponding single-cell voltage. Therefore, the fuzzy rule base consists of the AC impedance at kHz and all single-cell voltages. The parameters of the fuzzy rule base are determined by plotting characteristic diagrams of the fuel cell stack at constant temperatures. Stable system operation is achieved at T=°C for a power level of . W. The fuel cell stack is controlled successfully even when the external electric load changes.

Die Algen wurden in Hängeschläuchen produziert. Weil I. galbana nicht genügend wuchs, wurde diese Alge gekauft. Nach der Ernte wurden die Algen gefriertrocknet und zu Algenpulver verarbeitet. Mit einem Futterrechner wurden drei verschiedene Futter mit gleichen Anteilen an Hauptnährstoffen formuliert: Ein Futter ohne Algen (Kontrolle) und zwei Futter mit je zwei Algen (Porph/Nanno:  % P. sordidum und  % N. gaditana; Iso/Nanno:  % Isochrysis sp. und  % N. gaditana). Das Futter wurde mit einem Spaghetti-Extruder pelletiert. Es wurden drei Pellet-Grössen hergestellt. Es wurde ein neunwöchiges Fütterungsexperiment mit Tilapia-Larven mit einem Startgewicht von . g durchgeführt. Nach sechs Wochen und am Ende des Experiments wurden alle Fische gewogen. Wenige Fische wurden für weitere Analysen wie Längenmessung, Entnahme von Leber und Milz oder für Nährstoffanalysen verwendet.Mit . mg/L pro Tag wuchs N. gaditana besser als P. sordidum (. mg/L pro Tag). Von N. gaditana konnten  g Biomasse und von P. sordidum  g produziert werden. Der Gehalt an EPA war bei N. gaditana bei . % der TS, bei P. sordidum war der Gehalt an ARA unter der Nachweisgrenze. Isochrysis sp. hatte einen DHA-Gehalt von . % TS. Mit der Zugabe der Algen zum Porph/Nanno Futter konnte das Fischmehl um . % und das Fischöl um . % reduziert werden. Beim Iso/Nanno Futter waren es . % Fischmehl und . % Fischöl, die ersetzt werden konnten. Die Fische, welche mit den Algenfuttern gefüttert wurden, zeigten ein signifikant besseres Wachstum als die Fische in der Kontrolle. Dies zeigte sich in den Endgewichten, den Standardlängen, den höheren Wachstumsraten und den tieferen Food Conversion Ratios. Keinen Einfluss hatten die Algenfutter auf den Korpulenz-Faktor, den hepatosomatischen Index und die Filetfarbe, sowie auf die Anzahl Fische, die gestorben sind. Der spleenosomatische Index war bei den Fischen, welche das Algenfutter frassen, erhöht. Zudem hatten die Fische mit dem Algenfutter einen höheren Körper-Lipidgehalt als die Fische in der Kontrolle.Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich alle drei Algen als Futterzusatz eignen. Weiterführend könnte versucht werden, das Wachstum der Algen sowie die PUFA Produktion durch Optimierung des Reaktors und den Kulturbedingungen zu erhöhen. Die  % Algen im Fischfutter hatten einen positiven Effekt auf das Wachstum der Fische. Die Resultate des Fütterungsversuchs sind vielversprechend, dass höhere Anteile von Fischmehl und -öl im Fischfutter ersetzt werden könnten.","doc_id":13594,"prior":"Wasserqualität","sdg6":1},{"id":"47","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1272","date":"2017","language":"en","title":"Risk management of water systems in residential homes : The ‘process’ of Legionella prevention","authors":"Leiblein, Thomas W.; Füchslin, Hans Peter; Keserue, Hans Anton; Tucker, Matthew; Hofer, Susanne","subject":"Risk management; Process; prevention; Water system; Legionella;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Facility Management","type":"Konferenz: Paper","bid":"363, 658.2","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Risk management of water systems in residential homes : The ‘process’ of Legionella prevention; Risk management; Process; prevention; Water system; Legionella;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme;  Facility Management; In the present study data was collect and analysed to gain evidence for the present situation of Legionella risk management and prevention of water systems in different buildings in theCanton of Zurich, Switzerland.

Die bedarfsorientierte, flexible Form der Stromproduktion führt jedoch in den nachgelagerten Fliessgewässern zu tagesrhythmischen, kurzfristigen Abflussschwankungen («Schwall-Sunk»), welche eine Vielzahl von ökologischen Beeinträchtigungen mit sich bringen können. Mitunter kann der Eingriff in das Abflussregime auch zu einer Veränderung des saisonalen sowie täglichen Verlaufs der Wassertemperatur führen. Es wird angenommen, dass sich die kurzfristigen thermischen Änderungen («Thermopeaking») auf das Verhalten und die Habitatwahl von Bachforellen (Salmo trutta) auswirken könnten. Durch eine neu entwickelte Funktion der numerischen Simulationssoftware BASEMENT war es erstmals möglich, neben der Wassertiefe und der Fliessgeschwindigkeit auch die Wassertemperatur in ein physikalisches Habitatsimulationsmodell für juvenile Bachforellen miteinzubeziehen. Eine morphologisch natürliche, verzweigte Flussaue an der Moesa im Kanton Graubünden diente dabei als Modellökosystem. Als Grundlage für die Habitatmodellierungen fungierte ein numerisches D-Modell, welches an der VAW und der EAWAG entwickelt wurde. Die Szenarien mit und ohne Schwall-Sunk wurden basierend auf den hydrologischen und meteorologischen Verhältnisse im Frühsommer abgeleitet. Um die Verfügbarkeit von thermisch geeigneten Jungfischhabitaten zu bewerten, wurden neue Indizes eingeführt und überprüft, inwiefern sich die thermisch geeigneten Habitate in Raum und Zeit mit hydraulisch geeigneten Habitaten überlagern.Bei warmem, sonnigem Wetter mit hoher Strahlungsintensität waren die Voraussetzungen gegeben, dass sich im Tagesverlauf eine relativ hohe thermische Heterogenität einstellen konnte. Die Verfügbarkeit von thermisch geeigneten Jungfischhabitaten war eng an die räumliche Heterogenität der Wassertemperaturen geknüpft. Es wurde ein deutlicher Tagesgang mit einem Maximum um die Mittagszeit festgestellt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten weiter, dass den Seitenarmsystemen eine grosse Bedeutung als Jungfischhabitate zukamen, da sie sowohl einen hohen Anteil hydraulisch als auch thermisch geeigneter Habitate aufwiesen. Zudem wurde bei Schwall ein Grossteil der hydraulischen Habitate in die Seitenarme verlagert. Die Auswirkungen des Thermopeakings auf die thermische Heterogenität und die thermische Habitatverfügbarkeit hingen von der Temperatur der Wasserrückgabe und der Tageszeit ab. Unter Einhaltung der spezifischen Grenzwerte bezüglich der Pegel- und Temperaturänderungsraten könnte womöglich durch ein saisonal und tageszeitlich abgestuftes Betriebsregime eine hohe thermische Heterogenität und somit eine hohe Habitatvielfalt in der untersuchten Flussaue aufrechterhalten werden. Es wird angenommen, dass dadurch die Vitalität der Forellenpopulation gesteigert werden könnte.Die neue Funktion in BASEMENT zur thermodynamischen Modellierung von Fliessgewässern birgt ein grosses Potenzial, um bei der Schwall-Sunk Sanierung die Wassertemperatur in die Bewertung der Habitateignung miteinzubeziehen. Die Erkenntnisse der vorliegenden Arbeit tragen dazu bei, die Effekte des Thermopeakings auf die Habitatdynamik in Fliessgewässern besser zu verstehen und leisten damit einen Beitrag zur ökologischen Sanierung der Wasserkraft.Abstract: Storage and pumped storage hydropower plants are an important source of renewable energy in the Alpine region. However, the demand-oriented, flexible form of electricity production leads to circadian, short-term flow fluctuations in downstream rivers («hydropeaking»), which can imply multiple adverse effects on ecosystems. Occasionally, this artificial flow fluctuations can lead to changes in the seasonal and daily patterns in water temperature regime. It is assumed that shortterm thermal changes associated with hydropeaking (known as «thermopeaking») could affect the behaviour and habitat selection of brown trout (Salmo trutta). A newly developed feature of the numerical simulation software BASEMENT made it possible to include the water temperature in a physical habitat simulation model for juvenile brown trout to assess the impact of thermopeaking on habitat availability. In addition to water temperature, water depth and current velocity were used for habitat modelling. A natural braided floodplain on the Moesa river in the Canton of Grisons served as model ecosystem. At VAW and EAWAG a D numerical model was developed for the research perimeter, which was used as the basis for the habitat modelling. The scenarios with and without hydropeaking were derived based on the hydrological and meteorological conditions in early summer. In order to assess the availability of thermally suitable habitats, new indices were introduced. Moreover, the extent to which thermally suitable habitats overlap with hydraulically suitable habitats in space and time was examined.At warm and sunny weather conditions with high global radiation intensity, the preconditions were in place, that a relatively high thermal heterogeneity could appear during the day. The availability of thermally suitable habitats for juvenile brown trout was closely related to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of water temperatures. A clear diurnal cycle with a maximum about noon was found. The results further showed that the side arm systems were of great importance as juvenile habitats because they had both, a high proportion of hydraulically and thermally suitable habitats. In addition, most of the hydraulic habitats were shifted into the side arm systems during peak flow. The effects of thermopeaking on thermal heterogeneity and thermal habitat availability were depended on the temperature of the water release of the hydropower plant and time of the day. In compliance with the specific limits for flow and temperature alteration rates, a high thermal heterogeneity and thus a high diversity of thermal habitats could possibly be maintained by means of a seasonal and daytime adjusted operating regime. It is assumed that this could increase the vitality of the trout population in the investigated floodplain.The new feature in BASEMENT for thermodynamic modelling of rivers has great potential to include the water temperature in the assessment of habitat suitability in the case of hydropeaking restoration. The findings of the present work help to better understand the effects of thermopeaking on habitat dynamics and thus contribute to the ecological rehabilitation of hydropower production.","doc_id":13838,"prior":"floodplain","sdg6":1},{"id":"79","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22610","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Broad diversity of bacteria degrading 17ß-estradiol-3-sulfate isolated from river sediment and biofilm at a wastewater treatment plant discharge","authors":"Mainetti, Tamara; Palmisano, Marilena; Rezzonico, Fabio; Stres, Blaž; Kern, Susanne; Smits, Theo H.

In the first experiments (n=) we observed relative drift and stranding rates for a single hydropeaking event focusing on the effect of time of day on a homogenous gravel bank. The second test series (n=) focused on two dewatering potholes installed as potential traps. Additional experiments (n=) were done with a reduced downramping rate to gain information about potential mitigation effects on stranding risk. During daytime and decreasing water level, we observed low drift rates of % and stranding rates below % in dewatering potholes and on homogenous gravel banks. However, in the presence of dewatering potholes, nighttime drift rates were about three times and stranding rates about ten times higher than on the homogenous gravel bank. A lowered downramping rate reduced drift to about a quarter and almost eliminated nocturnal stranding risk. These results might be used to effectively regulate water releases from high-head storage hydropower plants in a more suitable way for sensitive life stages of fish. Reducing the downramping rate or shifting peaks to daytime can reduce negative effects of hydropeaking in consideration of the morphological character of affected rivers.","doc_id":14524,"prior":"river ecosystems","sdg6":1},{"id":"73","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19121","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Das Triftprojekt : ein Überblick zu Projekt, Ökologie und Partizipation","authors":"Schweizer, Steffen; Schwegler, Benno; Rohrer, Magdalena; Meyer, Matthias; Schläppi, Sandro; Baumgartner, Jan; Berger, Benjamin; Fahner, Sonja; Fankhauser, Andres; Zeh Weissmann, Heiko; Niedermayr, Andreas; Roullier, Christian; Döring, Michael","subject":"Ökologie; Aue; Wasserkraft;  Energie","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"333.79","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Das Triftprojekt : ein Überblick zu Projekt, Ökologie und Partizipation; Ökologie; Aue; Wasserkraft;  Energie; Mit der Realisierung des Triftprojekts kann ein wesentlicher Beitrag zur erfolgreichen Umsetzung der schweizerischen Energiewende geleistet werden.

Measurements were carried out at three incubation temperatures (, , °C) and ETSA/R ratios (i.e. exploitation of the overall metabolic capacity) were investigated to better understand the effects of temperature and inundation on floodplain functional heterogeneity. Furthermore, ETSA/R ratios obtained during experimental inundation were compared to ETSA/R ratios from field measurements to investigate the exploitation in total metabolic potential at different conditions. Lowest ETSA and R were measured in samples from channel and gravel habitats, followed by those from islands. Substantially higher values were measured in soils from riparian forest and grassland. Both ETSA and R increased with increasing temperature in samples from all habitats, while the ETSA/R ratio decreased due to a rapid response in microbial community respiration to higher temperatures. The metabolic capacity exploitation (i.e. ETSA/R) during experimental inundation was lowest in predominantly terrestrial samples (riparian forest, grassland), indicating the weakest response to wetted conditions. Comparison of experimentally inundated and field conditions revealed that in rarely flooded soils, the metabolic capacity was less exploited during inundation than during non-flooded conditions. The results suggest high sensitivity in floodplain respiration to changes in temperature and hydrological regime. ETSA/R ratios are considered good indicators of changes in metabolic activity of floodplain soils and sediments, and thus useful to estimate the impact of changes in hydrological regime or to evaluate success of floodplain restoration actions.","doc_id":15066,"prior":"floodplain","sdg6":1},{"id":"11","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2355","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Wastewater treatment in the urban environment","authors":"Junge-Berberovic, Ranka; Graber, Andreas","subject":"Constructed wetlands; Urban ecosystems;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"577","year":"2004","for_data_analysis":"Wastewater treatment in the urban environment; Constructed wetlands; Urban ecosystems;  Ökologie; Constructed wetlands are a valid option for wastewater treatment even in urban areas.

Trade-offs are often assumed to be bidirectional, where opposite ends of a gradient in trait values confer advantages in different environments. However, unidirectional benefits could be widespread if extreme trait values confer advantages at one end of an environmental gradient, whereas a wide range of trait values are equally beneficial at the other end. Here, we show that root traits explain species occurrences along broad gradients of temperature and water availability, but model predictions only resembled trade-offs in two out of  models. Forest species with low specific root length and high root tissue density (RTD) were more likely to occur in warm climates but species with high specific root length and low RTD were more likely tooccur in cold climates. Unidirectional benefits were more prevalent than trade-offs: for example, species with large-diameter roots and high RTD were more commonly associated with dry climates, but species with the opposite trait values were not associated with wet climates. Directional selection for traits consistently occurred in cold or dry climates, whereas a diversity of root trait values were equally viable in warm or wet climates. Explicit integration of unidirectional benefits into ecological theory is needed to advance our understanding of the consequences of trait variation on species responses to environmental change.","doc_id":15248,"prior":"water availability","sdg6":1},{"id":"24","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19819","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Invader presence disrupts the stabilizing effect of species richness in plant community recovery after drought","authors":"Vetter, Vanessa; Kreyling, Jürgen; Dengler, Jürgen; Jentsch, Anke","subject":"Invasive species; Climate change;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333.7, 577","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Invader presence disrupts the stabilizing effect of species richness in plant community recovery after drought; Invasive species; Climate change;  Landflächen, Naturerholungsgebiete;  Ökologie; Higher biodiversity can stabilize the productivity and functioning of grassland communities when subjected to extreme climatic events. The positive biodiversity‐stability relationship emerges via increased resistance and/or recovery to these events. However, invader presence might disrupt this diversity‐stability relationship by altering biotic interactions. Investigating such disruptions is important given that invasion by non‐native species and extreme climatic events are expected to increase in the future due to anthropogenic pressure.Here, we present one of the first multisite invader x biodiversity x drought manipulation experiment to examine combined effects of biodiversity and invasion on drought resistance and recovery at three semi‐natural grassland sites across Europe. The stability of biomass production to an extreme drought manipulation (% rainfall reduction; BE:  days, BG:  days, DE:  days) was quantified in field mesocosms with a richness gradient of , , and  species and three invasion treatments (no invader, Lupinus polyphyllus, Senecio inaequidens).Our results suggest that biodiversity stabilized community productivity by increasing the ability of native species to recover from extreme drought events. However, invader presence turned the positive and stabilizing effects of diversity on native species recovery into a neutral relationship. This effect was independent of the two invader's own capacity to recover from an extreme drought event.In summary, we found that invader presence may disrupt how native community interactions lead to stability of ecosystems in response to extreme climatic events. Consequently, the interaction of three global change drivers, climate extremes, diversity decline, and invasive species, may exacerbate their effects on ecosystem functioning.","doc_id":15394,"prior":"drought","sdg6":1},{"id":"65","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/7259","date":"2018","language":"de","title":"Hochlagenbegrünung","authors":"Krüsi, Bertil","subject":"Schweiz; Hochlagenbegrünung;  Landschaftsgestaltung (Landschaftsdesign)","type":"Beitrag in Magazin oder Zeitung","bid":"712","year":"2014","for_data_analysis":"Hochlagenbegrünung; Schweiz; Hochlagenbegrünung;  Landschaftsgestaltung (Landschaftsdesign); Begrünungen sind auch oberhalb der Waldgrenze machbar, müssen aber sorgfältig und individuell geplant und ausgeführt werden.

In this context, resource recovery using nature-based solutions (NBS) is gaining popularity worldwide. In this specific review, we focus on NBS as technologies that bring nature into cities and those that are derived from nature, using (micro)organisms as principal agents, provided they enable resource recovery.

In a mixed deciduous and coniferous forest on an area of  hectares it has an urn graves, burial row graves, family and community graves, and other forms of burial. The cemetery provides a habitat for numerous wild animals and has many structures due to its ecological care. During several months and numerous field hours the fauna was recorded in the cemetery. Among the taxonomic groups considered are mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies, and grasshoppers. Based on these results, measures were developed to promote biodiversity in the wooden cemetery. The measures consist of species and biotope protection and are intended to promote synergies in biocoenosis.  different species have been identified, of which  are birds, the most species-rich class. In the case of mammals and birds, the expected species were found, but in the case of butterflies and grasshoppers, there was a lack of habitat specialists who inhabit forest edges and clearings. Two special species in the forest cemetery are the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) and the Lamprohiza splendidula, which, however, does not belong to the recorded species. The most important measures for the conservation or promotion of biodiversity are the thinning of the beech trees when they’re young, the preservation of the cave trees, the promotion of a stepped forest edge and an exit aid from the water bodies.; Der Waldfriedhof Schaffhausen hat ein breites Spektrum an verschiedenen Lebensräumen. Auf einer Fläche von  Hektaren hat es in dem Laubmischwald Urnengrabstätten, Erdbestattungs-Reihengräber, Familien- und Gemeinschaftsgräber, sowie weitere Bestattungsformen. Der Friedhof bietet zahlreichen Wildtieren einen Lebensraum und weist durch die ökologische Pflege viele verschiedene Strukturen auf. Während mehreren Monaten und zahlreichen Feldstunden wurde die Fauna im Waldfriedhof aufgenommen. Zu den taxonomischen Gruppen, welche berücksichtigt wurden gehören Säugetiere, Vögel, Reptilien, Amphibien, Tagfalter, Widderchen und Heuschrecken. Basierend auf diesen Ergebnissen, wurden Massnahmen ausgearbeitet, um die Biodiversität im Waldfriedhof zu fördern. Die Massnahmen setzen sich aus Arten- und Biotopschutz zusammen und sollen die Synergien in der Biozönose fördern. Es wurden  verschiedene Arten nachgewiesen, wovon die Vögel mit  die artenreichste Klasse darstellt. Bei den Säugetieren und Vögeln wurde jene Arten nachgewiesen welche zu erwarten waren, bei den Tagfaltern und Heuschrecken fehlten die Lebensraumspezialisten, die Waldränder und Lichtungen bewohnen. Zwei besondere Arten im Waldfriedhof sind das Grosse Mausohr (Myotis myotis) und der Kleine Leuchtkäfer (Lamprohiza splendidula), welcher jedoch nicht zu den aufgenommenen Arten gehört.

The Ice Age relict grows in weakly acidic, slightly eutrophicated and cool waters, which have a low water hardness. The widespread species Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm. and N. pumila form the fertile hybrid Nuphar x intermedia (Ledeb.). In the Canton of Zurich there are  waters where it is attempted to establish permanent populations of N. pumila. The populations in these settlement waters develop with varying degrees of success.This work compares site conditions between successful and unsuccessful waters and the four natural stocks. In the unsuccessful waters warmer temperatures, higher pH values and higher water hardness and lower nutrient concentration were expected. It can be assumed that non-competitive N. pumila is associated with only a few other plants. Furthermore, negative influences on the coverage of N. pumila were anticipated. Chemical-physical water properties, pH, conductivity, temperature, oxygen content, oxygen saturation and turbidity were measured in all settlement waters and in the lakes with autochthonous populations. In fourteen prioritized waters additional vegetation surveys, water analyses of the parameters calcium, magnesium, water hardness, nitrate and phosphate and sampling of the diatoms took place.; Das Vorkommen der Kleinen Teichrose Nuphar pumila (Timm) DC beschränkt sich in der Schweiz auf vier Gewässer, Kämmoosweiher (ZH), Gräppelensee (SG), Lac Lussy (FR) und Lac des Joncs (FR). Sie ist als stark gefährdete Art eingestuft. Das Glazialrelikt wächst in schwach sauren, leicht eutrophierten und kühlen Gewässern mit  einer  geringen Wasserhärte. Zwischen der weitverbreiteten Art Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm. und N. pumila entsteht der fertile Hybrid Nuphar x intermedia (Ledeb.). Im Kanton Zürich gibt es  Gewässer mit Ansiedlungsversuchen in denen sich die Populationen mit unterschiedlichem Erfolg entwickeln. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden Standortbedingungen zwischen erfolgreichen und erfolglosen Ansiedlungsgewässern sowie den natürlichen Beständen verglichen. In den erfolglosen Ansiedlungsgewässern wurden wärmere Temperaturen, höhere pH-Werte und Wasserhärte und weniger Nährstoffe erwartet als in den anderen Gruppen. Es wurde davon ausgegangen, dass sich die konkurrenzschwache N. pumila mit wenig an deren Pflanzen vergesellschaftet. Auch ein negativer Einfluss der Calcium-und  Magnesiumkonzentrationen auf den Deckungsgrad von N. pumila wurde vermutet. Die chemisch-physikalischen Wassereigenschaften, pH-Wert, Leitfähigkeit, Temperatur, Sauerstoffgehalt, Sauerstoffsättigung und die Trübung, wurden in allen Gewässern gemessen. In vierzehn priorisierten Gewässern fanden Vegetationsaufnahmen, Berechnungen der Zeigerwerte, Wasseranalysen von Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Wasserhärte (dH), Nitrat (NO-N) und Phosphat (PO-P) und Beprobungen der Kieselalgen statt.","doc_id":16782,"prior":"lakes","sdg6":1},{"id":"91","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19948","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Evaluation der wahrgenommenen Sicherheit der Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner der Stadt Winterthur","authors":"Pleger, Lyn Ellen; Mertes, Alexander; Dietrich, Simone","subject":"Subjektives Sicherheitsempfinden; Befragung Bevölkerung Winterthur; Stadtpolizei Winterthur; Unterwegs in Winterthur; Probleme in Winterthur; Verhalten der Stadtpolizei Winterthur;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Working Paper – Gutachten – Studie","bid":"363","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Evaluation der wahrgenommenen Sicherheit der Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner der Stadt Winterthur; Subjektives Sicherheitsempfinden; Befragung Bevölkerung Winterthur; Stadtpolizei Winterthur; Unterwegs in Winterthur; Probleme in Winterthur; Verhalten der Stadtpolizei Winterthur;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme; Ziel der Studie zum subjektiven Sicherheitsempfinden der EinwohnerInnen der Stadt Winterthur ist eine explorative Erhebung der Wahrnehmung der Sicherheit in Winterthur sowie die Beurteilung der Arbeit der Stadtpolizei Winterthur aus Sicht der Bevölkerung. Die Ergebnisse sollen der Stadtpolizei Winterthur dabei helfen, Massnahmen zur Erhöhung des Sicherheitsempfindens und zur Verbesserung der wahrgenommenen Polizeiarbeit abzuleiten. Die Studie basiert auf einer Online-Befragung, zu welcher sämtliche Haushalte der Stadt Winterthur im August  postalisch eingeladen wurden. Die Ergebnisse beruhen auf Antworten derjenigen BewohnerInnen, die sich freiwillig an der Umfrage beteiligt haben, wodurch die Stichprobe keiner repräsentativen Zufallsstichprobe aller BewohnerInnen der Stadt Winterthur entspricht. Mit der Studie soll nicht die objektive Sicherheitslage in Winterthur gemessen werden, sondern sie hat vielmehr zum Ziel, Einflussfaktoren auf das subjektive Sicherheitsgefühl von BewohnerInnen in Winterthur abzubilden, um daraus praktische Massnahmen für die Stadtpolizei Winterthur ableiten zu können.Die Einladung zur Teilnahme wurde an insgesamt ’ Haushalte versandt.

Hinsichtlich des Geschlechts zeigten sich keine signifikanten Unterschiede. Bei mehr als der Hälfte (%) der Befragten blieb das Sicherheitsempfinden in den letzten fünf Jahren unverändert. Für ein Drittel der Befragten verschlechterte sich das Sicherheitsempfinden innerhalb der letzten fünf Jahre und für % hat es sich verbessert (N=’). Hauptgrund für ein ver-schlechtertes Sicherheitsempfinden stellt für % der Befragten die Wahrnehmung der Sicherheitslage im Allgemeinen dar (N='). % der Befragten geben an, dass es Stadtkreise gibt, die sie allgemein als unsicher empfinden (N=’). Dabei werden das Stadt-zentrum Winterthur und Töss als unsicherste Stadtkreise empfunden, wohingegen Veltheim und Seen als die am wenigsten unsiche-ren Stadtkreise beurteilt werden. % der Befragten sind ausserdem der Meinung, dass es in Winterthur Plätze und Orte gibt, an denen sie sich unwohl fühlen (N=’), wobei dies insbesondere nachts (%) oder allgemein (%) zutrifft. Dennoch werden Orte und Plätze von der Mehrheit der Befragten nicht bewusst gemieden (%). Zu den meistgenannten Orten und Plätzen in Winterthur, an denen sich eine Mehrheit der Befragten unsicher fühlt, zählt der Bahnhof (%), gefolgt vom Stadtpark (%) (N=').Die Mehrheit der Befragten (%) war in den vergangenen zwölf Monaten keiner Situation ausgesetzt, in der sie sich bedroht gefühlt hat (N=’). Von denjenigen Personen, die sich bedroht gefühlt haben (N=’), gab mehr als ein Drittel an, sich aufgrund des (auffälligen) Verhaltens von Einzelpersonen oder Gruppen bedroht gefühlt zu haben, ohne selber in die Situation involviert gewesen zu sein (N=).Was die Probleme in Winterthur betrifft, so werden «Littering» (N=’) und «undiszipliniert fahrende FahrzeuglenkerInnen» (N=’) von den Befragten als die grössten Probleme wahrgenommen. Die geringste Relevanz wird Problemen im Zusammenhang mit Delikten gegen Leib und Leben sowie Terroranschlägen beigemessen. Als eine der relevantesten Massnahmen zur Erhöhung der Sicherheit in Winterthur nannte eine Mehrheit der Befragten «mehr Schutz von VelofahrerInnen im Strassenverkehr» (N=’) sowie «mehr PolizistInnen, die zu Fuss oder mit dem Velo in der Stadt patrouillieren» (N=’). Als weitere Sicherheitsmassnahme gaben % der Befragten (N=) «Sanktionen und Kontrollen gegenüber Velo- und TrottinettfahrerInnen» an.Die allgemeine Zufriedenheit mit der Arbeit der Stadtpolizei Winterthur ist unter den Befragten hoch. So gaben % der Befragten an, mit der Arbeit der Stadtpolizei Winterthur eher bis sehr zufrieden zu sein. Im Gegensatz dazu gaben % der Befragten an, mit der Arbeit der Stadtpolizei Winterthur eher bis sehr unzufrieden zu sein (N=’). Weiter zeigen die Ergebnisse ein im Allgemeinen hohes der Befragten Vertrauen in die Polizei (N=’).Im Hinblick auf die Tätigkeitsbereiche der Stadtpolizei Winterthur macht die Stadtpolizei aus Sicht der Mehrheit der Befragten genau richtig viel in den Bereichen «mit Inseraten und Plakaten auf Gefahren aufmerksam machen» (%, N=’) sowie «Unterstützung der Bevölkerung bei Problemen» (%, N=’). Die Bereiche, in denen die Stadtpolizei nach Ansicht von % der Befragten zu wenig macht, sind «uniformierte Fuss-/Velopatrouillen im Wohnquartier» (N=’) und für % «in Uniform auf der Strasse und auf Plätzen in Winterthur präsent sein» (%, N=’). Das Verhalten der Stadtpolizei Winterthur wird insgesamt positiv beurteilt. Dabei stimmten die Befragten durchschnittlich am meisten der Aussage zu, dass die Stadtpolizei Winterthur den Anruf rasch entgegenge-nommen hat (N='). Die durchschnittlich geringste Zustimmung findet sich unter den Befragten zu der Aussage «Die Stadtpolizei Winterthur hat mir bei der Lösung meines Problems geholfen» (N=’).  % der Befragten bringt in der offenen Frage (N=’) auch Lob oder Dank an und  % der Befragten äussern sich gegenüber der Stadtpolizei kritisch.Zusammenfassend deuten die Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die Befragten mit der Arbeit der Stadtpolizei insgesamt zufrieden sind und sie dieser ein hohes Vertrauen entgegenbringen. Hinsichtlich des subjektiven Sicherheitsempfinden fühlen sich die Befragten insbe-sondere nachts an bestimmten Orten und Plätzen unsicher. Dazu zählen primär der Bahnhof und der Stadtpark. Als eines der grössten Probleme in Winterthur beurteilen die Befragten das Littering sowie undisziplinierte FahrzeuglenkerInnen. In Bezug auf die Sicher-heitsmassnahmen fordern die Befragten mehr Schutz für VelofahrerInnen und FussgängerInnen. Des Weiteren wünschen sie sich mehr Präsenz von PolizistInnen, die zu Fuss oder mit dem Velo in der Stadt patrouillieren.","doc_id":17306,"prior":"Seen","sdg6":1},{"id":"10","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/24906","date":"2022","language":"de","title":"Grundlagen ethischer Unternehmensverantwortung","authors":"Schüz, Mathias","subject":" Ethik;  Leitendes Management","type":"Buch","bid":"170, 658.4","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Grundlagen ethischer Unternehmensverantwortung;  Ethik;  Leitendes Management; Die Ölpest im Golf von Mexiko, die Kernschmelze von Fukushima, der Dieselabgasskandal, die weltweite Finanzkrise, Klimawandel und Artensterben sowie zahllose weniger bekannte Schädigungen von Mensch und Natur sind das Ergebnis unverantwortlichen Wirtschaftens.

Kann ethisches Verhalten in den Chefetagen solche Auswüchse vermeiden? Wenn ja, wie muss ethische Unternehmensverantwortung beschaffen sein, damit sich Geschäftstätigkeiten nicht nur für die Eigentümer, sondern auch auf Gesellschaft und Natur langfristig positiv auswirken?

The material flow analysis of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium provides a detailed picture of current nutrient flows within, in to, and out of smallholder farms. Such a picture allows quantifying material potentials for sustainable intensification, that is, increasing the ratio of crop yield to mineral fertilizer inputs. Finally, in the pursuit of indicators for sustainable intensification, we propose combining indicators derived from material flow analysis with indicators of socio-economic nature to move from material potential assessments to sustainability assessments. The combination is informed by the criticality concept, a concept which denotes how important a specific material resource is to an anthropogenic system. Based on an existing criticality determination methodology for metals, we sketch the criticality indicator set for the case of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and smallholder farms. Further research should include increasing temporal boundaries to capture cycles longer than a year, the applied temporal boundary in this study. A multi-scale study including villages and landscapes could provide additional insights on the role of water bodies or future .industrial activities in nutrient cycling. In turn, the multi-scale MFAs would provide the necessary indicator values to assess nutrient criticality not only at the smallholder farm level, but also at the village and landscape level.

Community phylogenetic structure reflects the relationship of historical processes, regional environments, and interactions between species, and studying it is imperative to understand the formation and maintenance mechanisms of community composition and biodiversity. We studied the phylogenetic structure of the shrub communities in arid and semiarid areas of the Mongolian Plateau. First, the phylogenetic signals of four plant traits (height, canopy, leaf length, and leaf width) of shrubs and subshrubs were measured to determine the phylogenetic conservation of these traits. Then, the net relatedness index (NRI) of shrub communities was calculated to characterize their phylogenetic structure. Finally, the relationship between the NRI and current climate and paleoclimate (since the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM) factors was analyzed to understand the formation and maintenance mechanisms of these plant communities. We found that desert shrub communities showed a trend toward phylogenetic overdispersion; that is, limiting similarity was predominant in arid and semiarid areas of the Mongolian Plateau despite the phylogenetic structure and formation mechanisms differing across habitats. The typical desert and sandy shrub communities showed a significant phylogenetic overdispersion, while the steppified desert shrub communities showed a weak phylogenetic clustering. It was found that mean winter temperature (i.e., in the driest quarter) was the major factor limiting steppified desert shrub phylogeny distribution. Both cold and drought (despite having opposite consequences) differentiated the typical desert to steppified desert shrub communities. The increase in temperature since the LGM is conducive to the invasion of shrub plants into steppe grassland, and this process may be intensified by global warming.","doc_id":18088,"prior":"drought","sdg6":1},{"id":"98","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/22382","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Building a new high-density air temperature measurement network in two Swiss cities","authors":"Anet, Julien G.; Schlögl, Sebastian; Spirig, Curdin; Frey, Martin P.; Renold, Manuel; Gutbrod, Karl G.","subject":" Geologie und Hydrologie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"551","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Building a new high-density air temperature measurement network in two Swiss cities;  Geologie und Hydrologie; With progressive climate change, weather extremes are very likely to become more frequent. While rural regions may suffer from more intense and longer drought periods, urban spaces are going to be particularly affected by severe heat waves. This urban temperature anomaly, also known as “urban heat island” (UHI), can be traced back to different factors, the most prominent being soil sealing, lower albedo and lack of effective ventilation.City planners have started developing mitigation strategies to reduce future forecasted heat stress in urban regions. While some heat reduction strategies are currently intensely scrutinized and applied within pilot projects, the efficiency of latter mitigation actions can be overseen due to the low density of reference in situ air temperature measurements in urban environments. The same problem applies when trying to benchmark modeling studies of UHI as the amount of benchmarking data may be insufficient.To overcome this lack of data, over the last two years, a dense air temperature measurement network has been installed in the Swiss cities of Basel and Zurich, counting more than  sensors. The low-cost air temperature sensors are installed on street lamps and traffic signs in different local climate zones of the city with an emphasis on street canyons, where air temperatures are expected to be the largest and most of the city’s population lives and works. These low-cost sensors add valuable meteorological information in cities and complement the WMO reference stations.Air temperature measurements from the low-cost sensor network were controlled for accuracy, reliability and robustness and homogenized in order to minimize radiation errors, although % of the stations were equipped with self-built radiation shields, allowing an efficient passive ventilation of the installed sensors.We demonstrate the strength of our network by presenting first results of two exemplary heat waves that occurred in July  and August  and show that a) the radiation-error corrected datasets correlate well with different high-quality reference WMO stations, and b) the existence of urban heat islands in Zurich and Basel can be well confirmed, showing significant air temperature differences of several degrees between rural and urban areas.The results demonstrate the advantages of a high-density low-cost air temperature network as a benchmark for future urban heat islands modelling studies.","doc_id":18171,"prior":"drought","sdg6":1},{"id":"4","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6524","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Development of a rapid test method for detection of (faecal) indicator organisms in drinking water","authors":"Gantenbein-Demarchi, Corinne; Kuhn, Roger; Krapf, Tamara","subject":"Drinking water; Fecal indicators;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"363","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Development of a rapid test method for detection of (faecal) indicator organisms in drinking water; Drinking water; Fecal indicators;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","doc_id":18276,"prior":"drinking water","sdg6":1},{"id":"35","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19905","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Characterizing flood impact on Swiss floodplains using inter-annual time series of satellite imagery","authors":"Milani, Gillian; Kneubühler, Mathias; Tonolla, Diego; Döring, Michael; Schaepman, Michael","subject":"Landsat; Unmixing; NDVI dynamics; Alps; Floods;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"333","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Characterizing flood impact on Swiss floodplains using inter-annual time series of satellite imagery; Landsat; Unmixing; NDVI dynamics; Alps; Floods;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; Pressure on the biodiversity of ecosystems along many rivers is growing continuously due to the increasing number of hydropower facilities regulating downstream flow and sediment regimes. Despite a thorough understanding of the shortterm processes and interactions at this hydro-biosphere interface, long-term analyses of the impacts on floodplain dynamics are lacking. We used inter-annual Landsat , ,  and  time series to analyze the effects of hydrological events on floodplain vegetation in four mountainous floodplains in the Swiss Alps. Using a spectral mixture analysis approach, we demonstrate that the floodplain vegetation dynamics of mountainous rivers can be recovered at a spatial resolution of  meters. Our results suggest that interactions between floods and floodplain vegetation are complex and not exclusively related to flood magnitude. Of the four reaches analyzed, only data gathered along the submountainous reach with a quasi-natural flow regime show a clear link between remotely sensed vegetation indices and floods. In addition, our -year time series shows a continuous upward trend in vegetation indices along the floodplains, strongest in the reaches affected by hydropower facilities.

Se han seleccionado tres áreas de estudio representando los mejores sabinares de Tenerife y La Gomera y se ha aplicado un muestreo sistemático con  puntos en cada área. Analizamos datos de estructura, composición florística, crecimiento y vitalidad con respecto a factores ambientales utilizando estadísticas uni- y multivariantes. La vitalidad y el crecimiento de los individuos igual que la estructura y la capacidad de carga de las poblaciones dependen en gran parte de las condiciones ambientales y están probablemente relacionados con los recursos hídricos disponibles para las plantas. Se han encontrado grandes diferencias en el número de plántulas que se relaciona también con las condiciones ambientales y la frecuencia de micrositios para la regeneración.

Baumassnahmen, unsachgemässe landwirtschaftliche Nutzung und der Wintersport können Narben hinterlassen, welche durch angepasste Begrünungsmassnahmen zu beheben sind. Neben dem Schutz des Bodens vor Erosion sollen Begrünungen nicht nur die landschaftliche Attraktivität, sondern auch die reiche, perfekt an die alpinen Verhältnisse angepasste Artenvielfalt erhalten. Bei Beeinträchtigungen von schutzwürdigen Lebensräumen mit seltenen oder gefährdeten Arten wird die Wiederherstellung auch vom Gesetzgeber vorgeschrieben.Die Standortbedingungen der alpinen und subalpinen Höhenstufen lassen biologische und chemische Prozesse nur langsam ablaufen. Tiefe Temperaturen, Wind oder Bodenerosion führen zu sehr langsamer Bodenbildung. Die dadurch geringe Wasserspeicherkapazität und Nährstoffverfügbarkeit erschweren das Pflanzenwachstum. Die Entwicklung und Etablierung der heutigen Vegetationsdecke ist das Resultat von sehr lang andauernden Prozessen.Nach einer Störung durch bauliche Eingriffe oder durch natürliche Ereignisse erholt sich die Vegetation in Hochlagen nur sehr zögerlich. Zudem breiten sich die meisten Pflanzenarten in dieser Höhenlage vorwiegend vegetativ und weniger über Samen aus. Es ist äusserst wichtig, die bestehende Vegetation zu schützen und bestmöglich wiederanzulegen. Ein weiterer bedeutsamer Punkt ist der Aspekt des Bodenschutzes: Nur bewachsener Boden ist gegen Einflüsse wie Erosion und Auswaschung optimal geschützt. In den letzten Jahren haben Verfahren zur Wiederherstellung einer standortgerechten Vegetation im Alpenraum weiter an Bedeutung gewonnen. Bestmögliche Resultate erzielt man mit der direkten Wiederverwendung der intakten Pflanzendecke in Form von Soden, wenn nötig mit Zwischenlagerung. Aussaaten sind unumgänglich, wenn keine oder zu wenig Soden abgeschält werden können. Das Saatgut kann nass oder trocken aufgebracht werden. Die Samenmischung sollte regional sein, dem Standort angepasst und keine gebietsfremden Arten enthalten. Zusatzstoffe wie Kleber oder Mulch helfen bei der Keimung und Etablierung der Saat. Häufig werden Aussaaten im Spätherbst als Schlafsaat ausgebracht, damit sie im Frühjahr bei optimalen Bedingungen keimen.Um langfristig ökologischen und auch wirtschaftlichen Schaden zu vermeiden, lohnt es sich, qualitativ hochstehende Begrünungen zu realisieren, welche einen guten Erosionsschutz bieten und die Anliegen von Natur- und Landschaftsschutz grösstmöglich berücksichtigen.

Da bei Begrünungen in Hochlagen neben der Etablierung einer standortgerechten Vegetation insbesondere die Erosions- und Rutschbeständigkeit wichtig sind, wurde in dieser Studie geprüft, wie rasch sich die umgelagerten Vegetationsziegel mit dem Untergrund stabil verbinden.Fünf Jahre nach der Umlagerung wurde an vier direkt umgelagerten Strassenböschungen die Verankerung und Durchwurzelung der direkt umgelagerten Vegetationsziegel, die Erosion sowie das Zuwachsen der Lücken zwischen den Ziegeln analysiert. Die Stabilität der Verankerung wurde getestet, indem in jeder Teilfläche an je  Ziegeln geprüft wurde, ob sie sich bewegen und vom Untergrund lösen liessen. In jeder Teilfläche fand an je  Ziegeln eine Prüfung der Verankerungsstabilität (d.h. ob sich die Ziegel manuell bewegen und vom Untergrund lösen liessen) statt. Die Untersuchung der Durchwurzelung der Ziegel und des Vordringens der Wurzeln in die Rohplanie wurde mittels Bodenprofile durchgeführt. Es wurde auch beobachtet, ob die Vegetationsziegel und die offenen Bodenstellen zwischen den Ziegeln Erosionsspuren aufwiesen. Zudem konnte optisch geprüft werden, ob sich die Lücken durch Bodenmaterial aufgefüllt hatten, und ob neue Vegetation in den Lücken aufkam. Die Resultate zeigen, dass die Ziegel fünf Jahre nach der Umlagerung gut durchwurzelt und gut im Untergrund verankert waren. Die im Mittel nur ca.  cm² grossen Lücken zwischen den einzelnen Vegetationsziegeln hatten sich mit Bodenmaterial aufgefüllt und waren im Mittel zu % mit Vegetation bedeckt.

Yet, currently the potential of energy sufficiency interventions by cities appears not fully realized. Although cities are initiating numerous interventions in the broad domain of energy relevant decisions, behaviours, and social practices, only few of them are rigorously analysed and evidence if the intervention works is scarce. Thus, learning from such experiments for other cities is hardly possible. At the same time, social scientists are keen to know if their theoretical or conceptual models actually work in practice. Yet they often lack the necessary resources (in financial and personnel terms), established contacts for cooperation and the expertise to test these ideas in a realistic setting. Thus, a combined and well-integrated effort of both cities and researchers would allow to jointly define, implement, analyse and interpret behavioural field experiments, as an example. That means, a trans-disciplinary collaboration among cities and researchers is needed. We present one concrete example of such a trans-disciplinary process comprising a co-designed field experiment implemented in the context of a project within the National Research Programme  “Managing Energy Consumption”.A trans-disciplinary cooperation process was established with the city administration of a Swiss city. In several workshops and meetings ideas for potential interventions were discussed together with representatives of the city administration. Finally, a field experiment in a public swimming pool was jointly planned and designed. The swimming pool was recently refurbished and new, low flow shower heads have been installed to save water but also energy due to reduced use of warm water. Our study design included a campaign to inform the visitors about the performance of the new shower heads and thus raise awareness for the water-energy nexus, that is the link between warm water provision and energy. Simultaneously, public services of the city are conducting a promotion campaign, allowing citizens to purchase a low-flow shower head at a subsidized price. These two measures build a setting, where a combination of a ‘soft incentive’ – information campaign and direct experience of an energy-saving product – and a financial one (subsidized shower heads) can be examined with regard to its effect on acceptability and social diffusion of an energy-saving product.An experimental condition in the correlational design was added to test if social interaction about the campaign among members of established groups (such as a swimming club) is different (e.g., more intense) from interaction among individuals. Given that both individual users and members of swimming clubs visit the swimming pool, we are able to test if (i) members of groups such as swimming clubs interact more about the information campaign, share more intensely their experiences with the new shower heads and if (ii) more intense forms of interactions actually lead to changes in attitudes and/or willingness to buy a low flow shower head.The study took place from January to February . So far N =  participants have filled in the questionnaire, administered outside the swimming pool and online for participants’ convenience. Two third of the respondents as well disclosed their name and address so that we can cross-check with the orders of subsidized shower heads. Full data analysis will follow and the results will be presented at the conference.The portrayed project transcends traditional accompanying research of an intervention, because it involves a co-design process between science and city administrations from the start to both shaping and planning the intervention as well as its scientific evaluation. This represents a learning process between science and practice, where both parties contribute their knowledge to implement and evaluate behavioural interventions. We discuss pros and cons of such participatory developed field experiments. For instance, the real world setting enables to test the applicability of theoretical approaches (here about social interaction and behavioural change). However, it becomes clear that specific constraints have to be considered. For instance, a full experimental design  is hard to achieve (i.e., a control group in a swimming pool without water saving shower heads).","doc_id":19991,"prior":"water provision","sdg6":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/2134","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Co-designing field experiments with cities : promoting energy-saving showerheads","authors":"Seidl, Roman; Stauffacher, Michael; Tomic, Uros; Moser, Corinne; Blumer, Yann","subject":" Energie","type":"Konferenz: Sonstiges","bid":"333.79","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Co-designing field experiments with cities : promoting energy-saving showerheads;  Energie; Cities may serve as change agents to influence energy related behaviour of their citizens.

Yet they often lack the necessary resources (in financial and personnel terms), established contacts for cooperation and the expertise to test these ideas in a realistic setting. Thus, a combined and well-integrated effort of both cities and researchers would allow to jointly define, implement, analyse and interpret behavioural field experiments, as an example. That means, a trans-disciplinary collaboration among cities and researchers is needed. We present one concrete example of such a trans-disciplinary process comprising a co-designed field experiment implemented in the context of a project within the National Research Programme  “Managing Energy Consumption”.A trans-disciplinary cooperation process was established with the city administration of a Swiss city. In several workshops and meetings ideas for potential interventions were discussed together with representatives of the city administration. Finally, a field experiment in a public swimming pool was jointly planned and designed. The swimming pool was recently refurbished and new, low flow shower heads have been installed to save water but also energy due to reduced use of warm water. Our study design included a campaign to inform the visitors about the performance of the new shower heads and thus raise awareness for the water-energy nexus, that is the link between warm water provision and energy. Simultaneously, public services of the city are conducting a promotion campaign, allowing citizens to purchase a low-flow shower head at a subsidized price. These two measures build a setting, where a combination of a ‘soft incentive’ – information campaign and direct experience of an energy-saving product – and a financial one (subsidized shower heads) can be examined with regard to its effect on acceptability and social diffusion of an energy-saving product.An experimental condition in the correlational design was added to test if social interaction about the campaign among members of established groups (such as a swimming club) is different (e.g., more intense) from interaction among individuals. Given that both individual users and members of swimming clubs visit the swimming pool, we are able to test if (i) members of groups such as swimming clubs interact more about the information campaign, share more intensely their experiences with the new shower heads and if (ii) more intense forms of interactions actually lead to changes in attitudes and/or willingness to buy a low flow shower head.The study took place from January to February . So far N =  participants have filled in the questionnaire, administered outside the swimming pool and online for participants’ convenience. Two third of the respondents as well disclosed their name and address so that we can cross-check with the orders of subsidized shower heads. Full data analysis will follow and the results will be presented at the conference.The portrayed project transcends traditional accompanying research of an intervention, because it involves a co-design process between science and city administrations from the start to both shaping and planning the intervention as well as its scientific evaluation. This represents a learning process between science and practice, where both parties contribute their knowledge to implement and evaluate behavioural interventions. We discuss pros and cons of such participatory developed field experiments. For instance, the real world setting enables to test the applicability of theoretical approaches (here about social interaction and behavioural change). However, it becomes clear that specific constraints have to be considered. For instance, a full experimental design  is hard to achieve (i.e., a control group in a swimming pool without water saving shower heads).","doc_id":19991,"prior":"water saving","sdg6":1},{"id":"49","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/19913","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Sensory-driven substitution of acrylate polymers with natural alternatives","authors":"Reichmuth, Nadine; Pedan, Vasilisa; Ott, Roman; Huber, Petra","subject":"Sensory analysis; Gelifying agent; Pre-screening tool; Rheology;  Technische Chemie","type":"Konferenz: Poster","bid":"660","year":"2019","for_data_analysis":"Sensory-driven substitution of acrylate polymers with natural alternatives; Sensory analysis; Gelifying agent; Pre-screening tool; Rheology;  Technische Chemie; Environmentalists are increasingly concerned about microplastics in the environment and are also critical of the use of liquid plastic in cosmetics putting the industry under pressure to find acceptable alternatives.

Six materials, shale, pumice, porous glass, quartz sand, activated carbon and anthracite were used as carriers for the biofilm. The reactors were operated in parallel for several months with vapour condensate from a sulfite cellulose process as feed. The criteria used for the evaluation were: a) Reproducibility of the reactor performance, b) performance of the different carriers under various loading rates, c) stability against toxic shock loadings using ,,-trichlorophenol (TCP) as toxicant, d) recovery capacity after intoxication and starvation, e) adsorption/desorption behavior of the carriers.A comparison between four runs showed good reproducibility of the steady state removal rates. The performance of the reactors and the stability of the degradation rates were tested for a range of loading conditions. Unbuffered, buffered and pH controlled conditions were compared. The pumice carrier was best with respect to the degradation rate achieved per carrier mass. The response of the reactors to massive TCP step loadings was tested. Loadings less than . kg TCP/md resulted in initially normal gas production rates for all the systems, except the activated carbon, whose gas production was partially inhibited from the start. After increasing the load to . kg TCP/md the gas production rates of all the other reactors fell abruptly to zero. Restarting after  months, all reactors showed methanogenic activity without requiring new inoculum.Adsorption and desorption experiments with TCP showed that only the anthracite and activated carbon adsorbed appreciable amounts. The activated carbon had the greatest adsorption capacity but did not release the TCP by desorption, as did the anthracite.A bicomponent (pumice and anthracite) carrier mixture was compared in biological experiments with pumice and anthracite carrier alone, with and without TCP loading. The pumice and the carrier-mix performed equally well under non-toxic-loading conditions. With TCP toxic loading, the performance of the anthracite was superior. The anthracite carrier could be regenerated, owing mainly to its capacity for desorption.","doc_id":20231,"prior":"water treatment","sdg6":1},{"id":"49","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3247","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Biological cyanide degradation in aerobic fluidized bed reactors : treatment of almond seed wastewater","authors":"Petrozzi, Sergio; Dunn, Irving J.","subject":"Cyanide; Activate sludge; Hydraulic retention time; Amygdalin; Soil slurry;  Biochemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"572","year":"1994","for_data_analysis":"Biological cyanide degradation in aerobic fluidized bed reactors : treatment of almond seed wastewater; Cyanide; Activate sludge; Hydraulic retention time; Amygdalin; Soil slurry;  Biochemie; Erworben im Rahmen der Schweizer Nationallizenzen (http://www.nationallizenzen.ch); The continuous aerobic transformation of synthetic cyanide waste-water, amygdalin solutions and almond seed extract containing cyanide was investigated in several fluidized bed reactors.

Microbial communities (alpha and beta diversity) differed more among floodplain habitats than between riverine floodplains. Microbial communities in all systems displayed congruent seasonal effects. In the residual and hydropeaking systems, an experimental flood was released from a reservoir to mimic a natural high flow event causing hydromorphological disturbance. The experimental flood caused a temporary shift in microbial communities by releasing microbes from the reservoir as well as redistributing communities among floodplain habitats. The flood-mediated shift in community structures had only a transient impact as pelagic bacteria did not persist within floodplain habitats over time after the flood. More frequent pulse disturbances might lead to an alternate structure of bacterial communities in floodplains over time.","doc_id":20757,"prior":"floodplain","sdg6":1},{"id":"30","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20672","date":"2020","language":"de","title":"Wirkung von abiotischen Faktoren auf das Wanderverhalten von Seeforellen beim Laichaufstieg und Laichabstieg im Fliessgewässer Hasliaare","authors":"Greter, Rafael","subject":"Seeforelle; Salmo trutta; Fischaufstieg; Fischabstieg; Laichwanderung; Laichmigration; Fischzählanlage; Videomonitoring; Ethohydraulik; Biologische Wirkungskontrolle; Resistivity Fish Counter; Fischleitsystem; Fish weir; Fish migration; Brown trout;  Tiere (Zoologie)","type":"Thesis: Master","bid":"590","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Wirkung von abiotischen Faktoren auf das Wanderverhalten von Seeforellen beim Laichaufstieg und Laichabstieg im Fliessgewässer Hasliaare; Seeforelle; Salmo trutta; Fischaufstieg; Fischabstieg; Laichwanderung; Laichmigration; Fischzählanlage; Videomonitoring; Ethohydraulik; Biologische Wirkungskontrolle; Resistivity Fish Counter; Fischleitsystem; Fish weir; Fish migration; Brown trout;  Tiere (Zoologie); Die stark gefährdete Seeforelle (Salmo trutta) ist in der Schweiz die wichtigste Zielart der Wiederherstellung der Fischwanderung.

Um die Wirkung verschiedener abiotischer Faktoren (Umwelteinflüsse) wie Abfluss, Wassertemperatur, Trübung, Lichtverhältnisse und Wetterverhältnisse auf das Wandererhalten der Seeforellen besser zu untersuchen, wurden die Seeforellen während der Laichwanderung in der Restwasserstrecke Hasliaare mit einer Fischzählanlage gezählt und die abiotischen Faktoren dazu erfasst.

As a young fish, it migrates from rivers to pre-alpine lakes (in this case to Lake Brienz) where it can grow very large (up to over  m) due to more available space, food and the generally warmer water temperature. As soon as it is fertile, it migrates back to the place of birth (\"homing\") to spawn. In order to better understand the effect of various abiotic factors (environmental influences) such as discharge, water temperature, turbidity, light and weather conditions on the migration behaviour of the lake running brown trout, the trouts were counted during spawning migration in the residual flow section of the Hasliaare. Therefore, a fish counting system was installed and abiotic factors were recorded during the measurement period. The fish counting system consisted of a counting chamber (resistivity fish counter including several monitoring cameras) and a fish weir (Seeforellenweiche).   lake running brown trout movements were recorded between .. - ...  trouts were determined individually by point pattern comparison. . % were identified as females and . % as males. Water temperatures below . °C interrupted or inhibited upstream spawning migration in the residual flow section of the Hasliaare. During downstream migration, activity was increased at low barometric pressure and and when increased flows occurred males and large females (>= cm) used them for downstream migration. The length of stay in the spawning area was much more distinctive in males, due to the earlier upstream migration and the longer search phase. Furthermore, the entire spawning migration preferably takes place in darkness. The results contribute considerably to a better understanding of the spawning migration of lake running brown trout and can be derived for aquatic ecological planning.","doc_id":20863,"prior":"lakes","sdg6":1},{"id":"9","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11592","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Microstructure-property relationships in a gas diffusion layer (GDL) for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, Part II : pressure-induced water injection and liquid permeability","authors":"Holzer, Lorenz; Pecho, Omar; Schumacher, Jürgen; Marmet, Philip; Büchi, F.N.; Lamibrac, A.; Münch, B.","subject":"Map;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"621.3","year":"2017","for_data_analysis":"Microstructure-property relationships in a gas diffusion layer (GDL) for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, Part II : pressure-induced water injection and liquid permeability; Map;  Elektrotechnik und Elektronik; The performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) strongly depends on a controlled water management within the porous layers. For this purpose we investigate liquid water transport in a commercial gas diffusion layer (SGL BA) on the pore scale. X-ray tomography experiments combined with pressure-induced water injection provide D images of the liquid water distribution inside the GDL at incremental pressure steps between  and  mbar.The breakthrough behavior of the liquid phase is highly anisotropic. In through-plane (tp) direction first bubble points appear at the outlet plane already at  mbar and the ‘breakthrough' then evolves continuously over an extended pressure range up to >  mbar. For in-plane (ip) direction the breakthrough is discontinuous and takes place at  mbar. Simulations of the intrusion process reveal that the different breakthrough behaviors are mainly triggered by different ip- and tp-transport distances. Short tp-transport distances through the thin gas diffusion layer (ca.  μm) are responsible for the characteristic continuous tp-breakthrough behavior, which is thus attributed to a so-called short-range effect.Dedicated methods for D-image analysis adapted to fibrous GDL microstructures were presented in part I. With these methods we quantify all microstructure characteristics that are relevant for liquid permeability. These characteristics of pore and liquid phases include size distributions of bulges and bottlenecks, connectivity, effective volume fractions, geodesic tortuosity, constrictivity and hydraulic radius. Quantitative relationships are established between these microstructure characteristics and the liquid permeability, which provide a better understanding of the underlying microstructure limitations for injection and liquid transport.For the in-plane direction the liquid permeability is limited to roughly a similar extent by tortuosity, constrictivity and effective volume fraction. In contrast, for through-plane direction relatively low volume fractions of the liquid phase put stronger limitations to the liquid permeability than tortuosity, constrictivity and hydraulic radius.The curves for relative permeability vs. saturation (and vs. capillary pressure, respectively) achieved from D-analysis reveal complex but characteristic (reproducible) shapes with concave, linear and convex segments. The shape of these segments can be attributed to distinct microstructure effects. In contrast, the conventional macroscopic descriptions from literature cannot capture these complex shapes and the underlying microstructure effects. Future investigations with different GDL materials are necessary in order to understand whether these complex shapes for the relative permeability represent a general feature of gas diffusion layers or if they are specific to the investigated SGL material.","doc_id":21032,"prior":"water management","sdg6":1},{"id":"65","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23248","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Liquid territory","authors":"Jäger, Monica Ursina","subject":"Culture; Cultural studies; Urban studies; Land ressources; Ressource management; Artistic research; Coastal studies; Maritime studies;  Politik;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen","type":"Buchbeitrag","bid":"320, 333","year":"2021","for_data_analysis":"Liquid territory; Culture; Cultural studies; Urban studies; Land ressources; Ressource management; Artistic research; Coastal studies; Maritime studies;  Politik;  Bodenwirtschaft und Ressourcen; The text \"Liquid Territory\" is based on a conversation between the author and Hans Hortig (ETH Future Cities Lab Singapore) and is the result of an artistic reasearch at the NTU CCA Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore.

The continuous growth of international tourism has supported the global economy via job creation and export revenues. Nevertheless, the tourism activities have caused negative impacts on the environment due to the over-exploitation of natural resources and inadequate environmental controls. Eco-tourism is an option that could appeal to tourists who are not interested in conventional holidays. Small businesses in Thailand addressing these ecological aspects can profit from an increase in the number of tourists staying in their hotels and participating in their leisure activities. Conventional travel agencies can expand their product portfolio by offering conventional holidays with a lower environmental impact. To determine environmentally friendly tourism options, an analysis of the environmental impact of both conventional and existing offers is required. This work aimed to assess environmental impacts of tourism activities and to recommend how to design sustainable tourism services with lower environmental impacts throughout the whole life cycle. The case study focuses on tourism activities in Patong, Phuket, Thailand – one of the world’s top tourism destinations. The functional unit was one tourist stay for one night (person.night). The foreground data were collected from one hotel, two hostels,  tourists ( Thais and  foreigners) and Patong municipality. Tourism activities consist of accommodation (hotels and hostels), mobility (airplane, ferry, private car, motorcycle, public bus and public van), leisure activities, food consumption (local, non-local, meat, vegetarian, etc.) and waste and wastewater management. End-point environmental impacts (human health damage, ecosystem damage, and resource scarcity) were assessed by using the ReCiPe  v. method. Criteria for eco-tourism identified as tourism activities with shared facilities, less resource uses and lower environmental impacts were applied for assessing level of eco-tourism in the studied area. Conventional tourism with hotel accommodation; mobility via long-haul flights/private vehicles; and intensive leisure activities had higher environmental impacts than eco-tourism due to the more resource uses per person.night. The mobility had contributed to more than % of all environmental impacts from tourism. The impacts from long haul flights could be partially compensated by the longer period of stay at the tourist destination. Domestic flights yielded lower impacts than domestic mobility via private vehicles. Hotel and hostels have similar environmental impacts from waste and wastewater management. When compared with the foreign tourists, the local tourists had lower environmental impacts due to the shorter mobility distance and the choices of activities. The assessment showed that % of tourists had medium to the highest levels of eco-tourism; and % of tourists had low to the least levels of eco-tourism. Future improvements to reduce environmental impacts from tourism should focus on international and domestic transport services and the length of stay. The improvement of public transport systems in tourist destinations is also needed in order to shift mobility patterns. This research can be applied to allow businesses to provide tourism services in a less environmentally impactful way and to support sustainable tourism policies in Thailand and around the world.","doc_id":21606,"prior":"wastewater","sdg6":1},{"id":"71","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/23121","date":"2021","language":"en","title":"Towards water and energy self-sufficiency : a closed-loop, solar-driven, low-tech laundry pilot facility (LaundReCycle) for the reuse of laundry wastewater","authors":"Bühler, Devi; Antenen, Nadine; Frei, Matthias; Koller, Christoph; Rousseau, Diederik P.

Of these / are natural grasslands, mainly in arctic-alpine and coastal areas, while / are secondary grasslands created via millennia of human land management, such as grazing, mowing and burning. As long as technological constraints limited the intensity of use, grasslands accumulated a lot of biodiversity, making them now the most species-rich habitat for many taxa. The direct economic value of agricultural products from grasslands (mainly dairy and meat) is  billion EUR per year (.% of the Gross Domestic Product of the region), while other ecosystem services like water and nitrogen retention, erosion control, biodiversity conservation and touristic use of traditional cultural landscapes together have a significantly higher value. After World War II, the situation of grasslands changed dramatically due to the excessive use of artificial fertilizer, much increased livestock numbers and the large-scale homogenization of site conditions towards mesic nutrient-rich situations. On the other hand, less productive and more remote sites were not profitable for agricultural use anymore and thus were abandoned (and subject to secondary succession). Both intensification and abandonment have strong negative impacts on grassland biodiversity. Many grassland habitats and their species are now highly threatened. Further important threat factors for grasslands in the region are airborne eutrophication and conversion to other land uses (croplands, forests, built-up areas), while we consider climate change, biotic invasions and direct human impacts to be less relevant than often thought. While grasslands are underrepresented among the nationally protected areas of the region, the Habitats Directive of the European Union put many of the more threatened grassland types into the conservation focus, so that they are now reasonably covered in the Natura  network (spatially at least). Maintenance or restoration of semi-natural grasslands of High Nature Value (HNV) requires that they are managed in a way that mimics traditional agricultural use with hay-making and low-intensity grazing, but can also involve new approaches, such as controlled burning, “semi-open pasture landscapes” or “extensive green roofs”, which sometimes might be more feasible in the current socioeconomic situation. Semi-natural grasslands are a unique feature of the cultural landscapes of Europe. We conclude that conserving them and their biodiversity for the future requires a drastic further “greening” of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU and of similar instruments in the non-EU countries of the region, while at the same conservationists should be more open-minded towards conservation approaches that go beyond designation of protected areas and mimicking traditional grassland management.","doc_id":21722,"prior":"erosion control","sdg6":1},{"id":"19","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/20960","date":"2020","language":"en","title":"Pyrolysis of dry toilet substrate as a means of nutrient recycling in agricultural systems : potential risks and benefits","authors":"Bleuler, Mira; Gold, Moritz; Strande, Linda; Schönborn, Andreas","subject":"Biochar; Dry toilet; Pyrolysis; Germination test; Nutrient recycling; Sanitation;  Chemie","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"540","year":"2020","for_data_analysis":"Pyrolysis of dry toilet substrate as a means of nutrient recycling in agricultural systems : potential risks and benefits; Biochar; Dry toilet; Pyrolysis; Germination test; Nutrient recycling; Sanitation;  Chemie; Biochar is increasingly being applied as a soil amendment in agriculture. Biochar is typically produced from plant biomass and contains relatively low amounts of plant nutrients (e.g., N, P, and K), thus providing limited fertilizer value. Human excreta contains plant nutrients that could be recycled to create sustainable agricultural nutrient cycles. This study investigated the potential of biochar derived from a dry toilet substrate as soil amendment. The substrate consisted of urine, faeces, and wood chips, and was pyrolyzed at – °C for  min. The biochar was analyzed for plant available P, water leachable P and K, carbon stability, pH, electrical conductivity, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and germination tests with barley and lettuce were conducted to estimate the biochar fertilizer value and potential bio-toxicity. The biochar contained . ± . g N/kg dry mass (DM), . ± . g P/kg DM and . ± . g K/kg DM. % DM P was extractable by formic acid solution, .% DM P and .% DM K were water leachable in a ten-day column water-leaching experiment. The biochar complied with European regulations for PAHs, PCBs, dioxins and heavy metal concentrations, except for Zn and Ni. Germination of salt-resistant barley was not affected by biochar doses < % DM, while salt-sensitive lettuce germination was inhibited at doses ≥ % DM, indicating that the dry toilet substrate biochar induced salt stress. Based on these results, it is recommended that urine separation should be considered for biochar of excreta, which could reduce salt stress while maintaining concentrations of “fixed” or bioavailable nitrogen.","doc_id":22173,"prior":"dry toilet","sdg6":1},{"id":"83","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/6514","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Quantitative real time PCR does not reliably detect single fecal indicator bacteria in drinking water","authors":"Krapf, Tamara; Kuhn, Roger; Kauf, Peter; Gantenbein-Demarchi, Corinne; Fieseler, Lars","subject":" Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"363","year":"2016","for_data_analysis":"Quantitative real time PCR does not reliably detect single fecal indicator bacteria in drinking water;  Umwelt- und Sicherheitsprobleme","doc_id":22331,"prior":"drinking water","sdg6":1},{"id":"29","handle":"https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/3417","date":"2018","language":"en","title":"Aquaponic systems : nutrient recycling from fish wastewater by vegetable production","authors":"Graber, Andreas; Junge, Ranka","subject":"Aquaponics; Vegetables; Fish; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft","type":"Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift","bid":"630","year":"2009","for_data_analysis":"Aquaponic systems : nutrient recycling from fish wastewater by vegetable production; Aquaponics; Vegetables; Fish; Urban farming;  Landwirtschaft; This chapter describes the possibility to combine wastewater treatment in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with the production of crop plants biomass.

This wash water contained toxic substances such as ammonium, cyanide, phenols, and PAH. The goal was to develop a system that degraded toxic substances, and achieved full nitrification of ammonia. A  kW model wood gasifier plant delivered wash water for the experiments, which was standardized to a conductivity of  mS/cm by dilution. Toxicity was assessed by bacterial luminescence detection, germination test with cress (Lepidium sativum), and pot plants cultivated in a hydroponic setup irrigated continuously with the wastewater. Treatment experiments were done both in planted and unplanted trickling filters. Plant yield was similar to conventional hydroponic production systems. The trickling filters achieved complete detoxification of phenol, PAH and cyanide as well as full nitrification. The specific elimination rates were  g m- Leca d- for phenols and  g m- Leca d- for ammonium in planted systems. In unplanted trickling filters circulated for  h, phenol concentration decreased from . mg/l to . mg/l and cyanide concentration from . mg/l to . mg/l. PAH concentrations were reduced from , µg/l to . µg/l within  days.The assays demonstrated the feasibility of using the technique to construct a treatment system in a partially closed circulation for gasifier wash water. The principal advantage is to convert toxic effluents from biomass gasifiers into a non-toxic, nitrogen-rich fertilizer water, enabling subsequent use in plant production and thus income generation.
